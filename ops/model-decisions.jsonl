While the security/privacy docs, runbooks, configs, and unit tests are in place, the CI harness lacks a working make ci target (fails reproducibly), and key security automation scripts (audit chain validator, unused secret scanner, DSAR propagation) are only documented as TODOs. Given the rules to prefer IN_PROGRESS when major automation/CI is absent, this WBS cannot be marked done yet."}
