# WBS-006 Part 12 — Pre-run Summary (2025-11-20)

## Plan vs Done vs Pending
- **Done (Part 11 recap):** Shared data source now supports messaging mutations/subscriptions; `MessagingWorkspaceClient` wires mutation/subscription hooks; unit docs/tests refreshed.
- **Plan (this run):** Deliver upload pipeline across controller/client/data source with React bindings and Next.js workspace UI integration so users can attach files with Safe-Mode aware previews; extend unit coverage for upload flows.
- **Pending (carry-overs):** Real AppSync subscription wiring, authenticated GraphQL transport, and Playwright/E2E coverage once backend endpoints and CI harness mature.
