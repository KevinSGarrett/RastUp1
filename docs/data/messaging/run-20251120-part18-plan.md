# WBS-006 Part 18 — Pre-run Summary (2025-11-20)

## Plan vs Done vs Pending
- **Done (Part 17 recap):** Controller/client/react bindings/data source now support inbox triage helpers (pin/archive/mute) with inline inbox controls and regression suites captured in run artifacts.
- **Plan (this run):** Deliver participant-facing message reporting flows and an admin moderation queue façade by extending headless stores, client mutations, React bindings, and Next.js UI surfaces; ensure audit metadata + dual-approval hooks are exposed for future backend wiring.
- **Pending (carry-overs):** Real AppSync wiring for moderation actions, authenticated transport helpers, dual-approval backend enforcement, and E2E/admin tooling coverage once moderation APIs and CI harness mature.
