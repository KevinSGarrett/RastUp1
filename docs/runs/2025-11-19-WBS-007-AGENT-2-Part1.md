# Run Notes — 2025-11-19 — WBS-007 Part 1 — AGENT-2

## Plan vs Done vs Pending (Pre-run)

- **Planned**
  1. Author initial Smart Docs data model migration covering clause, template, pack, instance, and sign event tables with retention-ready fields.
  2. Implement backend service scaffolding for Smart Docs (domain models, repository contracts, variable resolver stubs, and e-sign adapter interface).
  3. Extend API/schema layer with Doc Pack GraphQL types and mutations plus tests (unit + schema validation).
  4. Provide hashing and S3 evidence abstractions with accompanying unit tests.
- **Done**
  - None — new lane kickoff.
- **Pending**
  - Downstream UI/admin wiring, real PDF renderer integration, external e-sign provider wiring, full Docs-Before-Pay checkout enforcement, and comprehensive telemetry.

## Notes
