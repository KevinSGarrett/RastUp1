# Run Notes — 2025-11-27 — WBS-002 — AGENT-2

## Plan vs Done vs Pending (pre-run)

- **Done (prior runs)**: Core Aurora migration `db/migrations/021_core_base.sql`, profile/trust domain helpers, GraphQL schema, and validator/unit tests from 2025-11-25 run are in place; canonical DDL, event manifest, and privacy playbooks from AGENT-1's 2025-11-18 run remain the upstream reference.
- **Plan (this run)**: Extend data models to cover user/service/studio/booking/payment/messaging/event tables with strict FK cascades; implement runtime TypeScript data models with validation/masking; finalize JSON Schema contracts with versioning + manifest integration; wire CI guardrails and tests for schema drift; document privacy posture and scope paths.
- **Pending (following runs)**: Repository/resolver layer against Aurora, event pipeline ingestion, provider integrations, and full E2E booking/search wiring will remain out of scope unless explicitly unlocked by future WBS tasks.
