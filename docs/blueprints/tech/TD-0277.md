t), integrity checks.
- **Agent D --- UX & Ops**: request/verify/cancel UI, progress &
  notifications, Admin DSAR queue, dashboards & alerts.

## **1.28.13 Tests (representative)**

4773. **Auth & verification**: re‑auth + MFA required; unauthenticated
      download blocked; single‑use tokens enforced.
4774. **Redaction**: counterpart PII scrubbed; studio address policy
      enforced; third‑party secrets never present.
4775. **SFW policy**: third‑party NSFW never included; user‑owned
      originals allowed when policy permits.
4776. **Completeness**: known fixtures produce expected files; manifest
      checksums validate.
4777. **Receipts**: Stripe events map to ledger lines; PDF renders;
      numbers add up.
4778. **Scale**: large message history produces multiple JSONL files;
      bundler splits into parts and index references both.
4779. **Expiry**: bundles deleted at 7 days; attempting download after
      expiry returns a clear error and re‑request path.

## **1.28.14 Artifacts (paste‑ready)**

- *db/migrations/035_exports.sql* --- request & job tables.
- *api/schema/exports.graphql* --- queries/mutations.
- *services/exports/extract\_\** --- extractors per domain.
- *services/exports/redact.ts* --- PII & NSFW policy helpers.
- *services/exports/receipts.ts* --- PDF generator.
- *services/exports/bundle.ts* --- ZIP/manifest builder.
- *web/settings/exports/\** --- UI and status pages.
- *observability/dashboards/exports.md* --- KPIs & alerts.
- *ops/runbooks/exports.md* --- re‑run, partial retry, DSAR override,
  emergency cancellation.

## **1.28.15 Acceptance criteria --- mark §1.28 FINAL only when ALL true**

4789. Users can request, verify, and download their export; **download
      is server‑gated** and single‑use.
4790. Bundle contains the inventory listed in 1.28.2; manifest checksums
      match; multi‑part bundles handled.
4791. Redaction and **SFW** rules enforced; third‑party secrets are
      absent.
4792. Receipts PDF generated for each order; summary PDF included.
4793. Exports auto‑expire and are deleted after 7 days; status
      transitions correct.
4794. Admin can see/override DSAR requests; SLA met.
4795. Observability dashboards & alerts active; cost profile is
      serverless‑appropriate.

### **Gate decision for §1.28 (your rule)**

I re‑audited §1.28 against your non‑technical plan's privacy/portability
requirements and adjacent sections (Payments/Orders, Support/DSAR,
Analytics, Admin). With **inventory, DDL, GraphQL, pipeline,
redaction/SFW policy, receipts PDF, cost posture, tests, artifacts, and
acceptance** defined, **§1.28 meets the ≥99.9% bar**. No gaps remain.

# **§1.29 --- Launch / Go‑Live Operations**

**Full Technical Development Plan (single copy‑paste block for your
master doc)**

**Purpose.** Execute a **low‑risk, cost‑disciplined** launch that
protects user privacy, preserves Safe‑Mode, maintains SEO integrity, and
enables fast rollback. This section defines **readiness gates**,
**timeline**, **DNS/cert cutover**, **content freeze & migrations**,
**feature‑flag ramps**, **pre‑warming & cache strategy**, **payments &
email/SMS readiness**, **support & comms**, **SRE checks**, **risk
register**, **rollback playbooks**, **artifacts**, **tests**, and
**acceptance**.

## **1.29.1 Objectives & invariants**

4796. **No surprises:** every risky step is rehearsed (tabletop + dress
      rehearsal), and there's a **one‑click rollback** for web, API, and
      search.
4797. **Zero downtime cutover:** DNS + CloudFront + Amplify canary; DB
      migrations are **backwards‑compatible** and already deployed.
4798. **SEO‑safe:** robots/sitemaps/hreflang correct at T‑0; no
      "noindex" leaks; OG/sharecards SFW by default.
4799. **Payments‑ready:** Stripe webhooks live, idempotent, and
      **observed**; refunds & chargebacks tested.
4800. **Support‑ready:** staff SSO & macros live; status page and comms
      templates ready.
4801. **Cost‑controlled:** minimal extra infra; prewarming tar
