- **Access controls:** only participants + admins (read‑only,
  case‑based) can view thread content; all admin views are audited.

2272. **Realtime:** send/deliver/read receipts & typing; offline → push
      → deep link opens thread.
2273. **Action cards:** each card validates, triggers domain updates
      (booking, billing), and shows consistent state.

NonTechBlueprint

2274. **Attachments:** upload (size/type), virus/NSFW scan, Safe‑Mode
      previews.

2275. **Spam/rate limits:** token bucket & ML thresholds; false‑positive
      appeal flows.

2276. **Search:** snippets return; Safe‑Mode respected; blocked users
      excluded.
2277. **A11y & i18n:** keyboard navigation, screen reader labels, RTL

2278. **Perf:** inbox P95 \< 300 ms; thread open P95 \< 400 ms;
      send‑to‑deliver P95 \< 600 ms.

# **§1.24 --- Studios & Spaces (Listings, Booking Widget, Host Ops, Reviews) --- Full Technical Spec**

*(implements the non‑technical "Studios/Spaces" blueprint: Quick Facts,
Amenities, Rules & Policies, Availability & Pricing, Booking Widget,
Reviews & Reputation, Host Create/Edit Wizard, Host Dashboard &
Operations, ICS export, privacy of address, and "Pair with Talent"
cross‑module links).*

NonTechBlueprint

**What this delivers:** A complete "space marketplace" that lets hosts
list studios/locations, buyers browse and book time‑based slots with
min‑hours/buffers, handle deposits/house rules, coordinate in Messaging,
and leave verified reviews. Address privacy and door‑code sharing are
respected; the widget can link into a people‑booking flow (Linked
Booking Group).
