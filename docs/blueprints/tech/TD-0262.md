ing** in admin read paths.
  - S3: server‑side encryption; bucket policies deny public access; **S3
    WORM** for admin audit logs.
  - Typesense: EBS volume encryption; snapshots to S3 encrypted.

- **In transit**: TLS from clients → CloudFront → AppSync → Lambda; VPC
  TLS to Aurora; signed URLs for private S3 media.

- **Client storage**: only ephemeral; no PII in localStorage; tokens in
  HTTP‑only cookies.

## **1.24.8 Privacy, consent & user rights**

- **Consent**: explicit toggle for marketing; store consent in
  *dim_identity* (§1.21); pixels fire only when allowed.

- **Notices**: Privacy Policy, Cookie Notice; CMP (cookie banner) on
  first visit in regulated regions.

- **DSAR/RTBF**:

  - Request workflow in Support console (§1.15).
  - Deletes cascade to profiles, media (S3), search index (§1.18
    addendum 1.18.17), analytics lake (§1.21).
  - **SLA:** acknowledge ≤ 48h, complete ≤ 30 days.

- **Retention** (defaults): raw logs 25 months, derived analytics 36
  months, support cases 36 months, KYC/verification docs per legal
  minimums.

- **Age**: platform targeted **18+**; age gate on signup; **no**
  collection of children's data.

*privacy/dsar_runbook.md*.

## **1.24.9 Content safety & DMCA (linkage to §1.15, §1.22)**

- **Safe‑Mode**: *nsfw_band* ≤ 1 enforced on public search/cards/pages;
  non‑SFW never exposed in OG/sharecards.
- **Uploads**: image moderation at ingest (thresholds tuned to minimize
  false positives); SFW variant generation.
- **DMCA**: case macro takes down assets, revalidates pages within ≤ 10
  minutes, notifies parties; restore macro with evidence; full audit
  chain.

Artifacts: *services/media/moderation.ts*, *ops/runbooks/dmca.md*.

## **1.24.10 Payments & financial data**

- **Stripe Connect** for charges/payouts; we never handle PAN---**PCI
  scope: SAQ‑A**.
- **Plaid (optional)**: use only for bank account **tokenization**;
  store Plaid tokens, not account/routing numbers.
- **Webhooks**: signed, replay‑protected; run idempotently; failures
  routed to DLQ; financial events mirrored to ledger with audit trail.
- **Refund kernel**: applied by Support macro (time‑bands), logged per
  §1.15.

Artifacts: *services/payments/webhooks.ts*,
*security/webhook_hardening.md*.

## **1.24.11 Fraud & abuse signals (lightweight, privacy‑respecting)**

- **Signals**: IP reputation (WAF), device fingerprint hash (non‑PII),
  velocity rules on threads/requests, mismatched geo for payouts,
  abnormal edit rates (ranking dampening in §1.18).
- **Actions**: soft frictions (CAPTCHA), hold payouts, require IDV, or
  escalate to Trust & Safety.
- **Bias guardrails**: no protected‑class features; monitor exposure
  skew (see §1.18.22).

Artifacts: *services/risk/rules.yaml*,
*observability/dashboards/risk.md*.

## **1.24.12 Security monitoring & incident response**

- **Detectors**: GuardDuty, WAF logs, AppSync 4xx/5xx anomalies, IAM
  anomaly detection, unusual data egress.

- **Collection**: CloudTrail + AppSync + Lambda logs into S3; Athena
  views form the **security lake**; optional OpenSearch/SIEM later if
  needed.

- **Playbooks**:

  - Credential compromise, key leak, data exfil, PII mis‑log, Stripe
    webhook abuse, Typesense exposure, DMCA abuse.

- **SEV ladder**: SEV‑1 (user‑impacting breach), SEV‑2 (credible
  exploit), SEV‑3 (bug).

- **Postmortems**: within 5 business days; action items tracked;
  no‑blame policy.

## **1.24.13 Compliance mapping (initial posture)**

- **GDPR/CCPA**: DSRs, consent logs, RTBF, data maps, processor
  registry, SCCs if needed.

- **DMCA**: notice/takedown workflows and recordkeeping.
- **Tax/KYC**: W‑9/W‑8 storage, access controls (Finance role only),
  annual re‑cert reminders.
