## **1.23.8 Inbox Folders, Filters & Search**

- **Folders:** All, Unread, Starred, Inquiries, Invites, **Bookings**,
  **Disputes**, Archived, Spam---exactly as in non‑tech.

NonTechBlueprint

- **Filters:** by Role, Status (Awaiting reply, Payment pending),
  City/Date, Has files---mirror non‑tech.

NonTechBlueprint

- **Thread bundles:** group by counterparty with role‑scoped
  subthreads---matches "bundles" description.

NonTechBlueprint

- **Search:** Typesense index of message excerpts + thread metadata;
  respect Safe‑Mode; exclude blocked users' content unless searching
  within the thread.

## **1.23.9 Spam Controls, Rate Limits & Safety**

- **Rate limits:** per‑user token bucket: new‑conversation starts
  (credits + per‑hour cap), per‑thread send QPS, attachment size caps;
  Requests folder protected by stricter per‑sender gates.
- **Spam detection:** rules + lightweight ML: rapid multi‑thread
  outreach, repeated phrases/links, reputation signals.
- **Report/Block:** one‑tap from thread header; **block** stops delivery
  both ways; **report** files a T&S case with evidence bundles and
  policy tags (harassment, doxxing, illegal).

NonTechBlueprint_Part3

- **PII redaction (support‑side tool):** hide phone/email/addresses from
  public copies when necessary.

NonTechBlueprint_Part3

- **Enforcement:** auto‑muting, temporary holds, escalation to T&S lead
  for severe harms with legal hand‑off.

## **1.23.10 Notifications (Email/Push) & Quiet Hours**

- **Triggers:** new message, acceptance from Requests, action‑card
  responses, approvals, dispute events.
- **Channel policy:** no 18+ previews; **quiet hours** by recipient
  timezone; daily caps for non‑booking messages.
- **Unsubscribe controls:** per thread & per category.

## **1.23.11 Project Panel (Right‑Pane) Data**

- **Snapshot** of package/extras, schedule, location, participants,
  moodboard, shot list, call sheet, contracts, deliverables, milestones,
  expenses, payments, travel, notes---surfaced read‑only in the message
  view; edits flow through the appropriate action cards or project
  screens.

## **1.23.12 Error Taxonomy (client‑safe)**

- *REQUESTS_REQUIRED*, *CREDITS_EXHAUSTED*, *CONTACT_FILTER_UNMET*,
  *SAFE_MODE_BLOCKED*, *ATTACHMENT_TOO_LARGE*, *UNSUPPORTED_TYPE*,
  *RATE_LIMITED*, *OFFLINE_RETRYING*.

## **1.23.13 Observability & Telemetry**

- **Events:** *msg.thread.open*, *msg.start*, *msg.send*,
  *msg.delivered*, *msg.read*, *msg.attachment.upload*,
  *msg.action.submit/accept/decline*, *msg.report*, *msg.block*.
- **KPIs:** response time, response rate, request acceptance rate,
  booking conversion from thread, dispute rate, spam flag rate, reversal
  rate after appeal.
- **SLOs:** p95 send‑to‑deliver \< 600 ms; p95 initial inbox load \< 300
  ms; push delivery \< 10 s.

## **1.23.14 Cost & Scale Posture**

- **DynamoDB** on‑demand at launch; auto‑scales; write units sized from
  expected messages/day.
- **AppSync** pay‑per‑connection; set connection idle timeouts; compress
  payloads.
- **S3** for attachments; lifecycle transition to IA after 30--90 days;
  delete thumbnails if threads archived (configurable).
- **Typesense** reuse cluster (shared with search) for message snippets;
  cap stored fields.

## **1.23.15 Security, Privacy & Retention**

- **Privacy by default:** EXIF stripped unless opted‑in for studio
  proofs.
- **Retention:** operational retention 18 months; **legal hold** for
  disputes; aggregated analytics retained indefinitely.
- **Access controls:** only participants + admins (read‑only,
  case‑based) can view thread content; all admin views are audited.

## **1.23.16 Test Plan**

2270. **Requests flow:** first‑time contact → Request →
      Accept/Decline/Block; credits decremented only on start.
2271. **Contact filters:** enforce ID‑verified only / budget /
