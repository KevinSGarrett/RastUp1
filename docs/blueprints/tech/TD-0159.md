2633. **Request similar shoot**: CTA pre‑fills RFP and creates
      thread/RFP; edge cases (missing city/budget).
2634. **DMCA**: report → Admin case created → item blocked → unblock on
      resolution.
2635. **SEO**: JSON‑LD validates; only SFW case‑study URLs appear in
      sitemaps.
2636. **Perf**: LCP/INP within budgets on portfolio and case‑study
      templates (ties to §1.27 CWV budgets).

## **1.29.13 Work packages (Cursor 4‑agent lanes)**

- **Agent A --- Data & API:** migrations, GraphQL, presigned upload,
  moderation hooks, DMCA endpoint.
- **Agent B --- Web/RN UI:** Portfolio grid, case‑study page,
  collaborator dialog, Safe‑Mode rendering, Add‑to‑Board dialog.
- **Agent C --- Media pipeline & SEO:** Lambda transforms, EXIF strip,
  JSON‑LD helpers, sitemap emitters.
- **Agent D --- Discovery & RFP:** studio chip linking, "Request similar
  shoot" pre‑fill flow, Typesense indexing, telemetry.

## **1.29.14 Acceptance criteria --- mark §1.29 FINAL only when ALL true**

2641. Portfolio tab is live with SFW grids; owner can
      create/edit/publish items and case studies.

NonTechBlueprint

2642. Collaborator tagging works with **approval/decline**; only
      approved credits render; collaborator chips open profiles.

NonTechBlueprint

2643. Boards can collect People/Studios/Portfolio items; **Add to
      Board** is available and tracked.

NonTechBlueprint

2644. Case‑study pages support **Request similar shoot** pre‑fill;
      studio chip links to the studio page.

NonTechBlueprint

2645. Safe‑Mode strictly enforces **SFW** on public surfaces; anything
      beyond allowed tiers is hidden/blurred; pages remain indexable
      only when SFW.

NonTechBlueprint

2646. DMCA/report routes to Admin casework; items can be
      blocked/unblocked via T&S.
2647. Telemetry events exist per plan (*board.add*,
      *portfolio.tag.approve/decline*, *studio.link.click*, etc.).

NonTechBlueprint

2648. Performance/SEO budgets pass; cost posture
      (S3/CloudFront/lifecycle) configured.

# **§1.3 --- Booking, Payments & Disputes --- Full Technical Spec**

**Purpose.** Implement fast, trustworthy booking with Instant Book (IB)
and Request‑to‑Book (RTB), private **Smart Invite** to multiple
profiles, escrowed payments, transparent cancellation, and a fair,
auditable dispute process. This section translates your non‑technical
scope (Service Profile, Packages, Extras, Usage License, IB/Smart
Invite, checkout contracts, escrow, payout timing, and disputes) into
build‑ready detail.

NonTechBlueprint

## **1.3.1 Scope confirmation (from non‑technical → technical)**

- **Key concepts & objects**: Service Profile (SP), Packages, Extras,
  Usage License, Instant Book, Smart Invite, Auto‑accept rules.

NonTechBlueprint

- **Booking modes**: Instant Book; Request‑to‑Book (+ Accept / Decline /
  Counter); Smart Invite (multi‑recipient private brief; buyer can award
  one or more hires).

NonTechBlueprint

- **Checkout & payment flow**: select package/extras/license; pick
  date/time & location; dynamic travel fees; **contract pack
  auto‑attached** (Booking Agreement, Usage License, Model Release for
  model hires, Content Promotion Terms for creators); e‑sign at
  checkout; escrow notice; pay & confirm; calendars block; chat opens.

NonTechBlueprint

- **Escrow & payout**: charge buyer → hold funds ("escrow") → completion
  signals (time‑based vs deliverable‑based) → grace/review window →
  auto‑release if no dispute; new‑provider risk delays first payouts;
  ACH & card support; tipping after completion.

NonTechBlueprint

## **1.3.2 Architecture & cost posture**

- **Frontend**: Next.js web (SSR for booking; ISR for directory), React
  Native apps.
- **API**: AppSync GraphQL → Lambda resolvers → Aurora Postgres (core
  booking) + DynamoDB (idempotent event log) + S3
  (contracts/attachments).
- **Payments**: **Stripe Connect** (Standard/Express) +
  **PaymentIntents** for cards and **Financial Connections*
