ser.
- **Spam detection**: volume spikes, repeated links, identical titles →
  shadow‑throttle in feed.
- **GDPR/CCPA**: delete requests purge saved searches, follows, referral
  pending invites, sharecards, and shortlinks; keep aggregate counts
  only.
- **Email compliance**: all outbound growth mail honors §1.10
  preferences & includes one‑click manage‑prefs.

## **1.16.18 Observability & budgets (additions)**

- **Events**: *sharecard.created\|clicked*, *shortlink.resolve*,
  *bio.publish*, *touring.post\|expire*,
  *referral.pending\|awarded\|clawback*, *exp.view\|convert*.
- **KPIs**: alert CTR → checkout starts; book‑again conversion; follower
  growth; referral qualification rate; fraud hold rate; incremental
  bookings per experiment.
- **Budget controls**: daily cap on referral liability; if exceeded,
  auto‑switch program to *active=false* and post admin alert.

## **1.16.19 Tests & acceptance (additions)**

**Tests**

- Sharecards: OG tags present; NSFW replaced by SFW blur; expired
  shortlinks no longer resolve.
- Link‑in‑Bio: SSG page renders; SFW only; attribution UTM preserved;
  mobile snap points verified.
- Touring posts: auto‑expire; saved‑search alert linkage works.
- Verified spotlight: fairness cap and rotation enforced.
- Referrals: claim window, IDV gate, device/IP hold, award & clawback.
- Experiments: sticky bucketing, conversion events, SRM alert.
- Rate‑limits: posting/follow spam throttled with user feedback.

**Acceptance criteria (add to §1.16)**

3786. Sharecards + shortlinks working end‑to‑end with OG images and safe
      previews.
3787. Link‑in‑Bio pages publish with SFW assets and proper attribution.
3788. Touring announcements integrate with alerts and expire correctly.
3789. Verified spotlight rotates fairly and enforces per‑author caps.
3790. Referrals enforce claim window, IDV gate, anti‑abuse signals,
      award, and clawback.
3791. Experimentation emits exposure & conversion; dashboard shows lift,
      MDE, and SRM checks.
3792. Growth mail respects notification preferences; all KPIs and budget
      guards live.

# **§1.17 --- SEO & On‑Site Optimization --- Full Technical Development Plan**

**Purpose.** Make public pages **discoverable, fast, and safe**,
generating qualified intent for bookings. Deliver **stable URLs**,
**structured data**, **programmatic landing pages (city×role)**, and
**Core Web Vitals** within target budgets. All content must respect
**Safe‑Mode** (SFW in public), privacy, and compliance.

**Why new §1.17?** Your non‑technical plan mentions SEO elements
(canonical URLs, city/role pages, SEO‑friendly public content). You
asked for a deeper, explicit technical plan---this section formalizes it
end‑to‑end.

## **1.17.1 Scope → Technical**

- **Public URL architecture**: provider/studio pages, city×role
  landings, topic hubs, help/FAQ, case‑study posts, Link‑in‑Bio pages.
- **Indexing controls**: robots, canonicalization, sitemaps, hreflang,
  pagination policy, noindex for faceted noise.
- **Structured data**: JSON‑LD for *Organization*, *LocalBusiness*
  (studios), *Product/Service*, *BreadcrumbList*, *FAQPage*, and
  *AggregateRating* (SFW reviews only).
- **Programmatic SEO**: pre‑render thousands of **city×role** pages with
  unique copy & stats (avoid thin content).
- **Core Web Vitals**: LCP ≤ 2.5 s, CLS ≤ 0.1, INP ≤ 200 ms (mobile).
- **Content safety**: public surfaces **never** render NSFW previews;
  all OG/email previews use SFW assets.
- **Analytics**: search console feeds, crawl error tracking, event
  mapping (impressions → click → browse → checkout start).
- **Cost posture**: SSG/ISR + CDN, image optimization at edge, on‑demand
  revalidation; incremental, not monolithic re‑builds.

## **1.17.2 URL design & routing (Next.js on Amplify Hosting)**

**Canonical patterns** (lowercase; hyphen slugs; no trailing slash):

- **Homepage**: */*
- **City × role landing**: */{city}/{role}* →
