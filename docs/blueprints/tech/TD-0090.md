  Each with *code*, *message*, *hint*, *corrId*.

## **1.15.P Test plan (CI + sandbox)**

**Core flows**

1678. Open case from booking/order context; timeline auto‑stitches
      evidence.
1679. Deterministic refund outcomes by cancellation bands; manual
      override requires dual approval.
1680. Payout hold applied & released; finance views update.

**Chargebacks**\
4) Chargeback intake; evidence pack creation; representment submitted;
outcome handling (GL + risk).

**DMCA & policy**\
5) DMCA hides content; counter‑notice restores; audits present.\
6) Policy violation escalations; appeals path.

**Email bridge**\
7) Inbound email creates/appends case; spoofing rejected; attachments
scanned.\
8) Outbound reply threading correct.

**SLA & automations**\
9) SLA timers escalate; macros apply consistent decisions; rules trigger
holds on thresholds.

**Analytics**\
10) Case events land in Bronze → Silver → Gold (§1.13); dashboards show
backlog and win rates.

**Performance & cost**\
11) p95 case list fetch ≤ 120 ms; evidence download streams; S3
lifecycle verified.

1685. Users and agents can create, view, message, and close cases;

*(saved searches & alerts · weekly city digest · feed & follow ·
sharecards & link‑in‑bio · "book again" reminders · referrals/credits &

pause toggle) and **Weekly City Digest**.

NonTechBlueprint

• **Feed & Follow** (single unified feed with role tabs; Verified chip;
Safe‑Mode SFW previews).
