ty levers:**

- Flag‑gated rollouts by city; **Safe‑Mode required** everywhere at
  launch; **IB requires IDV** always.

- **Budget caps & alarms** for moderation calls/day; auto‑degrade to
  stricter blurs if vendor quota hit (fail‑safe preserves safety &
  brand‑safe posture).

### **1.5.L Telemetry, metrics & alarms**

We instrument exactly what you listed under **K) Metrics & Alarms**
(adoption, safety outcomes, reliability, fraud, impact, guardrails) with
EventBridge → Kinesis Firehose → Athena/QuickSight dashboards;
CloudWatch alarms for spikes & pass‑rate drops.

Key emitted events (examples):

- *trust.idv.started\|passed\|failed* • *trust.bg.started\|adjudicated*
- *content.classified* • *content.safeMode.required*
- *safety.report.opened\|resolved* •
  *enforcement.strike.applied\|expired*
- finance.payout.hold.applied\|released

### **1.5.M Acceptance criteria (mirrors your L‑list, made testable)**

2976. **Badges & unlocks:** Email/Phone/2FA, **IDV**, **Trusted Pro**,
      Social, Studio, References all visible; badge tooltips explain
      unlocks; **IB/NSFW/Payouts** unlock only on **IDV PASSED**.

2977. **Safe‑Mode:** Guests/first‑time see blurred sensitive thumbnails;
      adults can toggle; **FanSub** tab hidden unless OFF.

2978. **Automoderation:** Uploads/messages auto‑scored; human queue
      operational; decisions logged.

NonTechBlueprint

2979. **Safety flag ➜ triage:** Accused user's **Instant Book paused**
      pending triage; audit trail present.

NonTechBlueprint

2980. **Risk/holds:** New providers have reserve/hold per config;
      evidence export available for disputes.

NonTechBlueprint

2981. **Admin:** Two‑step rollbacks; immutable logs; evidence hashes
      stored; PII view is redacted by default.

### **1.5.N Rollout & ops playbook**

- **Feature flags + city gates** govern Safe‑Mode settings, IB gating,
  and moderation thresholds; every change requires a **two‑step
  confirm** and creates an **audited event**.

NonTechBlueprint_Part3

- **Training:** Quarterly refreshers (T&S, Support, Finance) and UAT
  drills; acceptance checklists in Admin.

### **1.5.O Cursor "4‑agents" build plan (so we can ship on autopilot)**

2984. **Agent A --- IDV & Payouts:** AppSync schema + Step Functions +
      Stripe Identity & Connect webhooks; *UserTrust* flags + unlock
      logic.
2985. **Agent B --- Moderation & Safe‑Mode:** Upload hooks + Tier‑0/1
      scoring + *safeModeRequired*; feed/search integration contract.
2986. **Agent C --- Background & Verification Center:** Checkr flow +
      Verification Center UI + badges & progress.
2987. **Agent D --- Admin & Enforcement:** Case queues, strike ledger,
      audit logging, feature flags/city gates.

Each agent ships with: unit + integration tests; synthetic data seeds;
rollback plan; CloudWatch dashboards; cost alarms.

# **§1.6 --- Support, Help Center & Knowledge Base --- Full Technical Spec**

**Purpose.** Deliver a cost‑conscious, elastic support stack that: (1)
solves most issues via **self‑serve Help Center + guided flows**, (2)
creates **context‑rich tickets** when contact is needed, and (3)
empowers agents with **macros, automations, SLAs, policy playbooks, and
one‑click outcomes**. Targets: **≥70% containment rate**, **P1 ≤ 4h
FRT**, robust metrics, and clear MVP→Phase 2 path.

## **1.6.1 Scope confirmation (from your non‑technical plan → technical)**

- **Help Center IA** with categories, article pattern (At‑a‑glance,
  Steps, FAQs, Related), and maintenance cadence (top‑50 monthly review,
  "What's new").

NonTechBlueprint

- **Internal tools & automation**: booking lookup, **one‑click
  outcomes** (refund %, credit, disable IB, apply strike, request info),
  macros, secure redacted attachments, **auto‑routing**, **SLA timers +
