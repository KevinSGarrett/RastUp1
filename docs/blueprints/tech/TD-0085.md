etry & ops dashboards (NRT)**

- **NRT views** (≤10 min): creator earnings today/MTD, failed invoices
  by creator, active subs, churn last 7 days, request backlog.
- **Gold KPIs**: conversion (profile→subscribe), PPV unlock CTR, request
  completion rate, refund/complaint rate, average tip, ARPU.
- **Alerts**: spike in invoice failures, refund bursts, DMCA volume,
  NSFW band‑2 misclassifications.

## **1.14.14 Errors & UX copy (client‑safe)**

- *FANSUB_IDV_REQUIRED*: "You must verify you're 18+ to access Fan‑Sub."
- *FANSUB_ENTITLEMENT_REQUIRED*: "Unlock this post to view the finals."
- *FANSUB_PRICE_OUT_OF_RANGE*: "That price is outside allowed limits."
- *PAYMENT_FAILED_RETRY*: "Payment failed---update your card to
  continue."
- *REQUEST_REVISION_LIMIT*: "You've reached the maximum revisions for
  this request."
- *CONTENT_UNAVAILABLE_DMCA*: "This content is temporarily unavailable."

All errors include *corrId* and map to telemetry.

## **1.14.15 Performance & cost budgets**

- **Previews only** ensures S3 ≪ cost of finals hosting. Target: ≤ 10
  TB/mo egress at launch (cached via CF).
- **Stripe fees** dominate; tune dunning to reduce involuntary churn.
- **Compute**: watermark/transcode Lambdas constrained by concurrency;
  queue spikes; no provisioned concurrency unless p95 exceeds SLA.

## **1.14.16 Test plan (expanded)**

- **Payments**: simulate happy path & failures (insufficient funds, 3DS
  challenge, dispute).
- **Entitlements**: PPV & subs access gates; cache TTL; token expiry.
- **Requests loop**: max revisions; inactivity auto‑close.
- **Moderation**: NSFW bands; PII detection; appeals; DMCA hide/restore.
- **Comms**: all templates send with quiet hours; unsubscribe works.
- **Analytics**: events arrive; NRT dashboards update; CUPED/guardrails
  compute.
- **Cost**: preview bandwidth under budget; Firehose/Athena within
  thresholds.

## **1.14.17 Work packages (ready to assign)**

- **Agent C --- Domain/API**: tables, resolvers, entitlement cache,
  state machines, receipts.
- **Agent B --- Payments/Taxes**: Stripe Billing + Connect flows, tax
  lines, webhooks, dunning.
- **Agent A --- Web**: creator storefront, PPV/subscribe/tip flows,
  request action cards, entitlement UI.
- **Agent D --- Safety/Admin/QA**: preview pipeline
  (scan/transcode/watermark), DMCA & moderation consoles, test
  automation + synthetic data.

## **1.14.18 Acceptance criteria --- FINAL gate for §1.14**

1596. Age/IDV gates and Safe‑Mode rules enforced across all Fan‑Sub
      surfaces.
1597. Subscriptions, PPV, tips, and request flows function end‑to‑end
      with correct receipts, taxes, and payouts.
1598. Previews are watermarked and scanned; finals are referenced via
      validated manifests; entitlement tokens work; access logs
      recorded.
1599. Stripe webhooks idempotent; dunning and refunds/chargebacks
      correctly update state, ledgers, and GL.
1600. Moderation/DMCA tooling in place with audits; anticircumvention
      enforced in captions/messages.
1601. NRT dashboards and Gold KPIs live; alerts configured for invoice
      failures, refunds, and DMCA spikes.
1602. Performance and cost within budgets under 48h synthetic load.

# **§1.15 --- Support, Disputes & Resolution Center**

*(case taxonomy · refund policies & flows · chargebacks & representment
· DMCA & policy violations · data model · evidence & timelines · API &
in‑app center · email bridge · automations & macros · payouts/holds ·
telemetry & SLOs · tests · cost)*

**Purpose.** Provide a unified, auditable system for **customer
support**, **refunds**, **booking disputes**, **payments issues**,
**chargebacks**, **DMCA**, and **policy‑violation reports**. It connects
to booking (§1.3), messaging (§1.4), docs (§1.5), trust (§1.6),
promotions (§1.7), reviews (§1.8), finance/GL (§1.9), comms (§1.10),
studios (§1.11), infra (§1.12), analytics (§1.13), and Fan‑Sub (§1.14).
We'll implement internal tooling, user‑facing "Support Center," and
operational automati
