**Update cadence:**

- On every write/mod decision, recompute aggregates; also nightly full
  recompute for consistency.

## **1.8.F Fraud & abuse controls**

**Heuristics (near-real-time):**

- **Self-review**: author matches seller or same household (IP/device
  cluster) → block.
- **Ring behavior**: small set of accounts reviewing each other
  frequently across short intervals.
- **Burst anomalies**: many 5-star or 1-star reviews in a short window
  relative to baseline.
- **Retaliation pattern**: reciprocal low star after a dispute outcome.
- **Content policy**: toxicity/hate/off-platform coercion detected by
  classifier → auto-hide and queue for T&S.

**Signals collected:** author age of account, spend history,
dispute/refund context, message sentiment trend, IP/UA/device
fingerprints, city mismatch.

**Actions:**

- Auto-hide with *status=\'hidden\'*, set *policy_flags.fraud_score*,
  enqueue moderation; notify author about review under review (no
  details that reveal heuristics).
- If confirmed, *removed* with reason; if cleared, *restore*.

**Rate limits:**

- Per account: N reviews/day, with backoff.

## **1.8.G Surfacing & UX**

**On SP and Studio pages:**

- Star average + count; recent highlights (last 90 days); facet bars;
  distribution histogram.
- Show **verified badges** alongside stars; link to policy page about
  how reviews work.
- For low-sample: "New --- limited reviews" message.

**In search cards:**

- Show stars (recent-weighted) and count; for low sample, show "New"
  chip; include **Trusted Pro/ID Verified** badges (from §1.6).

**In booking & thread:**

- Show counterpart's stars and count in headers; after completion, show
  **nudge to review** card until dismissed or submitted.

## **1.8.H Moderation & appeals (Admin console)**

- **Queue** of hidden/flagged reviews with fraud scores and policy
  classifiers.
- **Actions:** hide/remove/restore/edit-mask PII with regex (e.g.,
  phone/email); dual approval for removals.
- **Bulk ops** for ring takedowns (multi-review action).
- **Audit trail** pane (immutable log).
- **Appeals:** author can appeal once; T&S response logged; restored
  reviews recalc aggregates.

## **1.8.I Notifications**

- Buyer reminder to review at 24 h / 72 h; opt-out respected.
- Seller notified on new review; ability to **publicly reply** (one
  reply, editable once within 24 h; anti-harassment rules).
- If review hidden/removed → author notified with high-level reason and
  appeal link.

## **1.8.J Telemetry & lineage**

- *review.eligible.opened*, *review.create.attempt\|success\|fail*,
  *review.edit*,
- *review.report*, *review.hide\|remove\|restore*,
- *reputation.recompute*, *reputation.flag.fraud*,
- *notification.sent.review_reminder*,
  *notification.sent.review_published*,
- Correlate with *leg_id*, *target_id*, *author_user_id*.

**Analytics dashboards**: review funnels (invite→posted), star
distributions, facet trends, fraud queue size/latency, moderation
outcomes, impact on search CTR and conversion.

## **1.8.K Error taxonomy (client-safe)**

- *REVIEW_NOT_ELIGIBLE* --- leg not completed or author mismatch.
- *REVIEW_DUPLICATE* --- already reviewed this leg.
- *REVIEW_WINDOW_CLOSED* --- edit beyond 24 h window.
- *REVIEW_POLICY_BLOCKED* --- content violates policy (details not
  disclosed).
- *REVIEW_TOO_MANY_TODAY* --- rate limit.
- *REPLY_NOT_ALLOWED* --- duplicate or window closed.

## **1.8.L Performance & cost**

- **Reads** dominate; aggregates cached and invalidated on write.
- **Writes** relatively small; classifiers run serverless with
  concurrency caps.
- S3 storage minimal (preview photos); lifecycle to Intelligent-Tiering
  after 30 days.

## **1.8.M Test plan (CI + sandbox)**

**Eligibility & write path**

788. Completed leg → buyer can post one review; seller cannot; duplicate
     blocked.
789. Edit within 24 h succeeds; rating edit blocked; after window, edit
     blocked.
