# **§1.29 --- Case Studies, Portfolios & Boards --- Full Technical Spec**

**Purpose.** Showcase real work (case studies, portfolio sets) on role
profiles to increase buyer trust and conversion; allow collaborators to
be tagged and approve credits; let buyers and producers collect
favorites on **Boards** and launch "**Request a similar shoot**" flows.
All public surfaces must remain **SFW** with Safe‑Mode gating,
collaborator approvals, and DMCA/abuse handling. This section implements
the non‑technical acceptance: portfolio tab on profiles; tagging &
approvals; collaborator links to profiles; "Add to Board"; Safe‑Mode/SFW
only; and editor tools in the owner dashboard.
