eps.
- **FinOps**: cost anomaly response, emergency scale‑down steps.

Artifacts directory: *ops/runbooks/\*.md* with index
*ops/runbooks/README.md*.

## **1.30.12 Work packages (Cursor --- 4 agents)**

- **Agent A --- SRE Foundations**: service catalog, on‑call rotation,
  SLO dashboards, error budgets, incident/postmortem templates.
- **Agent B --- Growth Engine**: experiment automation hooks,
  saved‑search/digest cadence controller, UTM/click‑token QA, Lighthouse
  CI.
- **Agent C --- SEO & Content Ops**: sitemap jobs, schema.org coverage,
  crawl watchdog, 404/410 mapping, ISR revalidation automation.
- **Agent D --- FinOps & Cost Controls**: budgets/alerts, unit economics
  dashboard, rightsizing scripts, log retention policies.

## **1.30.13 Tests & drills (representative)**

4961. **GameDay monthly**: simulate Typesense outage → detect → restore
      from snapshot within target.
4962. **DR drill quarterly**: restore Aurora from snapshot to secondary
      region; meet RPO/RTO.
4963. **Incident exercise**: mock payment webhook failure; replay
      succeeds; postmortem filed.
4964. **SEO smoke**: robots/sitemap/hreflang validators pass; Lighthouse
      CI budgets met.
4965. **Growth guardrails**: experiment causes CTR lift but no drop in
      checkout success (guardrail test).
4966. **Cost alarm**: synthetic spend spike triggers alert; owner
      acknowledges within SLA.
4967. **Security**: secret rotation rehearsal; WAF rule change tested;
      SBOM delta scanner flags known CVE.

## **1.30.14 Dashboards & KPIs (canonical)**

- **Marketplace health**: search→view CTR, view→message,
  message→checkout, checkout→complete, repeat bookings,
  refund/chargeback rates.
- **Reliability**: API p95, error rates, zero‑results rate, index
  staleness, webhook failure rate.
- **Growth**: digest/alert CTR, referral conversion, SEO non‑brand
  clicks, top landing CTR and rank buckets.
- **Cost**: spend by service, cost/1k searches, cost/booking, anomaly
  feed.
- **Compliance**: DSAR SLA, takedown cycle time.

      used in at least one drill.

# **Appendix H --- UI/UX Reference (Text‑Based, Paste‑Ready)**

**Purpose.** Specify **layouts, flows, required fields, validations,
states, and events** for all user‑facing pages---**without images**---so
your master plan has a complete, build‑ready UI blueprint that works
with the design tokens and component library. This appendix does **not**
change data models; it binds them to concrete screens.

## **H.1 Design System & Layout Primitives**

**H.1.1 Grid & Breakpoints (responsive)**

- Breakpoints: *xs \<480*, *sm 480--767*, *md 768--1023*, *lg
  1024--1439*, *xl ≥1440*.
- Grid: 12‑column at *md+*; 4‑column at *sm*; single column at *xs*.
  Gutter 16px (*xs/sm*) → 24px (*md+*).
- Max content width: *lg* 1140px; *xl* 1320px.

**H.1.2 Type scale** (tokenized; exact fonts can be chosen later)
