orhood/pin shows to others.
4001. **Search/SEO**: facets present; public pages SFW; city×studios
      pages pass thin content gates (§1.17).
4002. **Verification**: document upload/review; rejection reasons
      stored; badge toggles.
4003. **Deposits**: auth hold → void on clean checkout; refundable
      charge → refund on resolution; nonrefundable fee → nonreversible.
4004. **Support**: dispute attaches evidence (before/after photos,
      check‑in/out times), kernel applied for refunds, admin audit logs
      emitted.

## **1.19.16 Acceptance criteria --- mark §1.19 FINAL only when ALL true**

4013. Owners can create/publish studios with **amenities, rules,
      add‑ons**, and SFW media; **Verified Studio** badge appears after
      doc approval.
4014. **Availability templates + blackouts + buffers** enforce truthful
      slots; holds/booking conversion are atomic; no double‑books.
4015. **Pricing** (min hours, day rate, add‑ons, cleaning, **overtime**)
      and **deposits** (hold/charge/nonrefundable) compute and settle
      correctly.
4016. **Address privacy**: exact location gated post‑confirmation;
      pre‑booking shows neighborhood + generic pin.
4017. **Search & SEO**: studios appear with proper facets; city×studio
      landings render unique content and pass SFW rules.
4018. **Support & disputes**: evidence pack includes check‑in/out and
      photos; time‑band refund kernel applies; admin audit logs are
      complete.
4019. **Costs** stay within serverless plan; no unbounded compute.
      Dashboards & alerts live for verification backlogs and double‑book
      incidents.

# **§1.20 --- Help Center & Knowledge Base (Self‑Serve Support & Guided Flows)**

**Full Technical Development Plan (single, copy‑paste block for your
master doc)**

**Purpose.** Deflect common questions with a **public Help Center** and
**in‑product guided flows**, reduce ticket volume, and improve
first‑contact resolution while staying Safe‑Mode compliant and
SEO‑friendly. Integrates tightly with **Support/Disputes (§1.15)**,
**Notifications (§1.10)**, **SEO (§1.17)**, **Search (§1.18)**, and
**Studios/People bookings (§1.12--§1.14)**.

## **1.20.1 Objectives & invariants**

4020. **Deflection without dead‑ends.** Every path ends with either a
      solved step or a one‑click way to **open a typed Support Case**
      pre‑filled with evidence (§1.15).
4021. **Safety & privacy.** Public content is **SFW**; no PII, no
      internal links; DMCA/policy takedowns propagate within **≤10
      minutes**.
4022. **Searchable & indexable.** SEO‑ready JSON‑LD (*FAQPage*,
      *BreadcrumbList*) and sitemaps; **noindex** for internal‑only
      articles.
4023. **Continuous review.** Every article has an **owner**, **review
      interval**, and **last‑reviewed** timestamp; stale content is
      auto‑flagged.
4024. **Low cost.** Static generation (ISR) + CDN; serverless authoring
      & ingestion; Typesense index shared with §1.18 (*help*
      collection).
4025. **Localization‑ready.** Content stored with *locale*, falls back
      to English when missing; *hreflang* in SEO pages.
