## **H.13 Analytics Events (per page type)**

For each screen above, we emit standardized events defined in §1.21
(e.g., *auth.login_view*, *search.query*, *profile.view*,
*checkout.success*, *help.article_view*). Each includes *page_context*
(route, city, role), *surface* (web\|pwa\|rn), and privacy‑safe user
flags. Acceptance: events validate against schema registry.

## **H.14 Accessibility Acceptance (global)**

- Keyboard traversal works on all forms & dialogs; visible focus; color
  contrast ≥ 4.5:1 for text.
- Form error summary at top of forms; ARIA live regions for async
  outcomes (upload progress, save success).
- Media and icons have alt/aria‑labels; motion reduced when OS setting
  is on.

## **H.15 Implementation Work Packages (4 Cursor agents)**

- **Agent A --- Auth & Settings:** login/signup flows, MFA, password
  reset, account/security pages.
- **Agent B --- Profiles & Studios:** editor UIs, media manager
  (upload/crop/reorder), public profile/studio pages.
- **Agent C --- Public & Search:** home, city×role, marketing template,
  help center layout, search grids & facets.
- **Agent D --- Booking & Messages:** request/booking flow, checkout,
  timeline, inbox/thread UI.

## **H.16 UI Tests (representative)**

- **Auth:** login failure/lockout, signup + verify, password reset.
- **Profiles:** edit & save fields; upload + crop + reorder; SFW variant
  visible on public page.
- **Public pages:** home loads within CWV budgets; city×role has correct
  hreflang/canonical; help ToC works.
- **Search:** filters & sort persistent via URL; zero‑results shows
  suggestions.
- **Booking:** feasibility calendar, kernel policy display, successful
  payment & receipt.
- **Settings:** MFA setup; payouts connect; DSAR link visible.
- **A11y:** no critical axe violations; keyboard‑only flow across major
  forms.

## **Direct answers to your questions**

# **Addendum --- Production‑Assurance Expansions (paste‑ready)**

These addenda **do not change** prior decisions; they make implicit
controls explicit and add "checklist depth" commonly requested by
security, compliance, and SRE reviewers.

## **A1. Threat Model & Abuse Prevention (STRIDE + Fraud/Risk)**

**Objectives.** Enumerate high‑value assets and attack/abuse paths; map
mitigations to tests and alerts.

**Assets & risks (representative):**

- **Payments & payouts** → card testing, synthetic refunds, account
  takeovers, payout hijack.
- **User content/media
