 disputes**, **payments issues**,
**chargebacks**, **DMCA**, and **policy‑violation reports**. It connects
to booking (§1.3), messaging (§1.4), docs (§1.5), trust (§1.6),
promotions (§1.7), reviews (§1.8), finance/GL (§1.9), comms (§1.10),
studios (§1.11), infra (§1.12), analytics (§1.13), and Fan‑Sub (§1.14).
We'll implement internal tooling, user‑facing "Support Center," and
operational automations---cost‑consciously and compliant with
record‑keeping.

We will not move to §1.16 until §1.15 satisfies your 99.9% bar.

## **1.15.A Canon & invariants**

1603. **Single front door** for all issues ("Support Center"), but
      **typed cases** with tailored flows.
1604. **Evidence first**: timelines aggregate **messages, deliverables,
      docs, approvals, geotime metadata**, and **payment records**---no
      decisions without evidence.
1605. **Refund math is deterministic** (driven by cancellation bands,
      completion status, and doc acceptance); manual overrides require
      **reasons + dual approval**.
1606. **Chargebacks ≠ refunds**: separate workflows; chargebacks follow
      card‑network timelines with **representment** packages.
1607. **Payout safety**: severe open cases place **holds** on affected
      payouts until resolved.
1608. **DMCA & policy**: legal requirements honored; immutable audits;
      content can be hidden rapidly but restored with counter‑notice if
      eligible.
1609. **Cost‑conscious**: in‑house ticketing with SES email bridge;
      optional external helpdesk later via adapter; storage in S3 with
      lifecycle policies.
1610. **Privacy**: no raw PII in case summaries beyond what's necessary;
      redaction tools for doxxing.
1611. **SLAs by severity**: response and resolution targets with SLO
      monitoring; breached cases auto‑escalate.

## **1.15.B Case taxonomy (types & subtypes)**

- **Booking issue** (people/studios)

  - *Pre‑event*: reschedule request, venue conflict, wrong filters.
  - *During event*: no‑show, late, unsafe, rules violation.
  - *Post‑event*: quality dispute, late delivery, partial completion,
    damages (studio).

- Payment & payouts

  - Charge failure, duplicate charge, refund status, **instant payout**
    delay, verification hold.

- Product/Account

  - Access problems, comms/unsubscribe, trust badge concerns.

- DMCA/IP

  - Infringing media claims (Fan‑Sub or previews), counter‑notice
    tracking.

- Policy violation

  - Harassment, doxxing, off‑platform solicitation (anticircumvention),
    hate speech, illegal content.

- Chargeback (card network)

  - Inquiry/notification, evidence packaging, representment, result.

Each maps to a **case flow** with specific states, required fields, and
resolution outcomes.

## **1.15.C Refund & dispute policy (deterministic kernels)**

**Bookings (people/studios) --- base rules**

- If **buyer cancels** within policy bands (from §1.3 /
  *studio_policy*): refund = band % of subtotal + service tax; platform
  fees treated per §1.9 (usually refundable before completion,
  non‑refundable after; configurable).
- If **seller cancels/no‑show**: full refund; optional credit bonus.
- **Partial completion** (time & materials): proration by time delivered
  or milestone completion when docs reflect acceptance.
- **Damages (studio)**: deposit capture rules in §1.3.N; evidence
  required (photos, timestamps, invoices).

**Fan‑Sub (subscriptions, PPV, requests, tips)**

- **Subscriptions**: no retro refunds after period starts unless (a)
  *involuntary churn* reversal, or (b) service outage; dunning handled
  via Stripe.
- **PPV**: refundable if content not delivered/unavailable within X
  days; once **finals accessed**, refund eligibility drops unless
  quality dispute validated.
- **Requests**: if delivered and **buyer approved**, refund only via
  goodwill; if *revision loop* exhausted with unresolved defects,
  partial refund per tariff.
- **Tips**: non‑refundable except fraud.
