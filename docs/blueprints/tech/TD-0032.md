ta visible to user (their statuses) and Admin roles only; not
  exposed to other users.
- Audit logs for every access by Admin with reason.

## **1.6.K Error taxonomy (client-safe)**

- *IDV_PROVIDER_UNAVAILABLE* --- retry or switch later.
- *IDV_FAILED* --- provide appeal/retry path.
- *BG_CONSENT_REQUIRED* --- user must accept consents.
- *BG_IN_PROGRESS* --- already running; point to status view.
- *SOCIAL_OAUTH_FAILED* --- include retry link.
- *TRUST_OVERRIDE_FORBIDDEN* --- admin lacked permission/two-person
  approval.

## **1.6.L Telemetry & SLOs**

**SLOs**

- IDV completion success rate (init→pass): ≥ **85%** MVP.
- BG turnaround (invite→clear): median **\<48h**; 90th **\<5d**.
- Social refresh lag: **\<24h**.
- Risk recompute latency: **\<15min** after new events.

**Dashboards**

- Funnel: startIdv → passed; startBg → clear; badge distributions;
  watch/action/critical counts; Instant Book enablement rate.

## **1.6.M Cost controls**

- IDV and BG are pay-per-use: expose as a **benefit** (badges, search
  boost, IB access) to motivate self-selection.
- Batch social refresh nightly; rate-limit on API quotas; cache
  snapshots.
- Background rechecks (recerts) scheduled by cohort to smooth spend.

## **1.6.N Test plan (CI + sandbox)**

619. **IDV pass** → badge issued, *age_verified=true*, Instant Book
     enabled; search boost visible.
620. **IDV fail/expired** → badge removed; IB disabled; 18+ surfaces
     gated.
621. **BG clear** → Trusted Pro badge issued; search boost; promotions
     eligibility allowed.
622. **BG consider** → no badge; Admin adverse-action flow required;
     user notified with correct template.
623. **Social verified** → badge appears; snapshot in index; revoke
     removes badge.
624. **Risk score thresholds** → throttles engage correctly; admin
     override works with dual approval.
625. **Privacy** → no PII in our storage; access logs for Admin views;
     legal hold respected.
626. **Webhooks idempotent** → duplicate events do not double-apply.
627. **SLO monitors** → IDV funnel and BG turnaround within targets on
     synthetic load.

## **1.6.P Acceptance criteria (mark §1.6 FINAL only when ALL true)**

632. IDV flow works end-to-end; badge & age gate applied; Instant Book
     correctly gated.
633. BG flow (optional) works with FCRA consents, statuses,
     adverse-action templates, and audit trails; Trusted Pro badge
     granted on **clear**.
634. Social verification connects/revokes; nightly snapshot reflected in
     search and badges.
635. Risk score updates from domain events and enforces throttles at
     thresholds; overrides require dual approval.
636. Admin consoles cover review, overrides, exports, and adverse-action
     steps with immutable audits.
637. Privacy posture holds (no raw PII stored; access logs); retention
     policies configured.
638. Telemetry/SLO dashboards for funnels and turnaround; all targets
     met under synthetic load.
639. Costs remain within budget; batch refreshes and cohort r
