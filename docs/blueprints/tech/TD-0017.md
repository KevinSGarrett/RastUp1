## **1.3.U Disputes (chargebacks) & Evidence Kits**

### **U.1 Sources of evidence**

- **Doc packs** (SOW, releases, studio rules) with immutable PDF hashes.
- **Thread transcript** (messages + action cards timestamps).
- **Deliverable manifest** (checksums, names, upload times).
- **Check-in/out** time evidence (session start/end).
- **Studio deposit policy** and photos (if relevant).
- **Buyer acceptance** event (if occurred) or issue report details
  (within window).

### **U.2 Flow**

337. Stripe webhook *dispute.created* → create *dispute* row (per leg).
338. **Evidence kit assembler** collates sources into a zip/PDF bundle +
     summary template.
339. Support fills in narrative, attaches evidences, **submits** to
     processor before *evidence_due_at*.
340. Webhooks update status → *under_review* → *won\|lost*.
341. If **lost**, apply **clawback** (adjust seller balance; reserve may
     absorb); update receipts/Gold facts; notify parties.

### **U.3 Admin console (Trust & Finance)**

- Timeline & deadline tracker; evidence editor; one-click export;
  outcomes log; dispute rates by seller/city; flags for investigation.

### **U.4 Telemetry**

- *dispute.opened\|evidence_submitted\|won\|lost*,
  *chargeback.clawback.applied*, *seller.flag.risk_breach*.

## **1.3.V Daily Finance Close & Reconciliation (hard gate)**

### **V.1 Purpose**

Guarantee money correctness between **processor records** and our
**ledger/Gold facts**, and gate payouts/tax filings when variances
exceed thresholds.

### **V.2 Inputs**

- Processor extracts: payments, refunds, disputes, payouts (settled
  date, amount, ids).
- Our facts: *charge*, *charge_split*, *refund*, *payout*, *tax_txn*,
  *amendment*, *reserve*.

### **V.3 Checks (examples)**

- **Σcharge_splits per LBG == charge.amount** (cents).
- **Σleg totals** == **Σ(allocations + refunds + platform_fees + tax)**
  within tolerance.
- **Σpayouts + reserves pending** equals **Σseller_net** over time
  windows.
- All external ids exist and are unique; duplicate webhooks are deduped.
- Tax committed count/amount matches provider reports.

### **V.4 Flow**

351. Extract → Stage → Compare (by day, tz aware).
352. **Variance threshold** (e.g., 0.5%) → **gate**: pause payouts,
     alert Finance/Eng, show recon diff tiles.
353. Quarantine bad rows; **replay** or **adjust** via Admin tooling
     with audit.
354. When green → **close day** → emit *finance.close.succeeded* event.

### **V.5 Admin tiles**

- Summary widgets: charges/refunds/payouts/tax; heatmap of variances;
  quick links to diff detail.
- Adjustment ledger UI: create/view adjustments with reason and linked
  records.

### **V.6 Telemetry**

- *finance.close.start\|succeeded\|failed*, *recon.variance.notice*,
  *adjustment.created*, *payouts.paused\|resumed*.

## **1.3.W Admin Consoles (Finance · Support · Trust · City Ops)**

### **W.1 Finance**

- **Ledger** per leg & seller; **Payout scheduler** queue; **Reserves**
  config & releases; **Tax** commits & exports; **Recon** dashboard;
  **Close day** button (two-person approval).
- Actions require reason; some require dual approval (money-moving).

### **W.2 Support**

- **Cancellation/refund** simulator + execution; resend receipts; edit
  buyer contact on receipts; acceptance window overrides; deposit claims
  approval UI.

### **W.3 Trust & Safety**

- **Disputes** timeline; evidence builder; policy rulebook; NSFW
  overrides; seller risk flags; rate limits for abuse.

### **W.4 City Ops / Promotions**

- City allowlists; **Promotions** density caps; eligibility toggles;
  invalid-click credits.

**RBAC**: least-privilege by role; JIT elevation for sensitive ops;
**immutable audits** on every admin action.

## **1.3.X Error & Incident Playbook (selected)**

- **PI fail after docs** → user sees *CHK_ATOMIC_FAIL*; LBG remains
  awaiting payment; guide to retry or change method.
- **ACH return** → auto-
