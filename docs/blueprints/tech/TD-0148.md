LA timers and notifications.
2425. **User**: suspend/reinstate; DSAR export; deletion request
      workflow.
2426. **Listings**: publish/unpublish; hazard/surveillance flags; COI
      required.
2427. **Finance**: refund/hold/release; reconciliation viewer; audit
      entries present.
2428. **Search curation**: pins & synonyms appear in search; TTL expiry
      works.
2429. **Docs admin**: template publish; envelope monitor; evidence view.
2430. **CMS**: help/announcement create & publish; localization; SEO
      pre‑render.
2431. **JIT access**: cannot open messages without case; time‑boxed
      access revokes properly.
2432. **Audit**: 100% of admin actions write to *admin_audit* and S3
      WORM stream.

## **1.26.14 Work packages (Cursor 4‑agent lanes)**

- **Agent A --- RBAC, Cases & Audit:** schema, resolvers, case flows,
  immutable audit, JIT access.
- **Agent B --- Ops UIs:** user/listing management, T&S workbench,
  finance console, curation tools, CMS screens.
- **Agent C --- Flags & Risk:** feature flags backend, risk knobs,
  rate‑limits, city activation controls.
- **Agent D --- Observability & SSO:** SSO/OIDC integration, step‑up
  auth, dashboards, alerts, WAF/IP allowlist.

## **1.26.15 Acceptance criteria --- mark §1.26 FINAL only when ALL true**

2437. RBAC & SSO enforced; destructive actions require step‑up; least
      privilege verified.
2438. Cases (reports/DMCA/disputes/fraud) run end‑to‑end with SLA
      timers, evidence capture, and outcome recording.
2439. Finance console performs refunds, holds, releases; reconciliation
      viewers work; audit exists.
2440. Listing and user moderation tools operate with privacy safeguards;
      messaging access is case‑bound and time‑boxed.
2441. Search curation and Smart Docs admin functions are live; CMS can
      publish localized help/announcements/city snippets.
2442. Feature flags & risk knobs adjustable with audit trails and (for
      high‑impact) 4‑eyes approval.
2443. Observability dashboards and SLO alerts are active; audit stream
      is immutable (S3 Object Lock).
2444. Costs and security controls match launch posture (serverless,
      CloudFront+WAF, IP allowlist).

# **§1.27 --- SEO & On‑Site Optimization --- Full Technical Spec**

*(crawl control · SSR/ISR build strategy · canonical/robots/sitemaps ·
structured data · pagination & faceted navigation · Safe‑Mode & SFW
indexing · media/OG tags · Core Web Vitals budgets · internal linking ·
error/redirect policy · analytics & monitoring · tests · acceptance)*

**Purpose.** Implement an SEO system that safely exposes only SFW
content, scales city/role/studio listings without creating crawl traps,
and drives qualified discovery for People and Studios. This fills the
non‑technical gap you flagged and ties into earlier sections (Search
§1.21, Studios §1.24, Messaging §1.23, Payments §1.22, Admin §1.26).

## **1.27.1 Canon & invariants**

2445. **SFW‑only indexing.** Public pages (profiles, studios, city
      pages) must render SFW previews and **noindex** any page that
      would expose 18+ content or paid assets. Safe‑Mode OFF areas are
      never indexed.
2446. **Stable URLs & canonical rules.** We allow a small, controlled
      set of query params to be indexed; everything else is
      **canonicalized** to a base URL to avoid duplicate content and
      crawl traps.
2447. **SSR/ISR.** City & directory pages use **Next.js SSR +
      Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)** for speed and freshness;
      profiles/studios use SSR with short revalidation.
2448. **Lightweight structured data.** We publish JSON‑LD for **Person**
      (People profiles), **Place** (Studios), and **BreadcrumbList** on
      directories; never include exact addresses on public Studio pages
      (privacy).
2449. **Crawl budget control.** We pre‑render and surface only
      "thin‑spine" pages (Cities × Roles/Genres), not combinatorial
      facets.
2450. **Performance first.** Core Web Vitals (CWV) budgets are enfo
