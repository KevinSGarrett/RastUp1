## **1.24.14 Cost & Scale**

- **Aurora Postgres** (serverless v2) autoscaling; keep read replicas
  off at launch; aggressive connection pooling via Data API.
- **Typesense**: shared cluster (same as §1.21) with capped fields;
  background reindex on publish/update.
- **S3/CloudFront** for gallery assets; image transforms cached;
  lifecycle to IA after 90 days.
- **Stripe** deposit holds auth‑only (no capture unless violation).
- **AppSync** on‑demand; resolvers primarily Data API + Lambda; no
  long‑polling jobs.

## **1.24.15 Work Packages (Cursor 4‑agent lanes)**

- **Agent A --- Data & API:** Aurora schema, GraphQL resolvers,
  deposit/IB rules, Linked Booking Group.
- **Agent B --- UI (Web/RN):** Listing pages (SSR), Widget, Wizard,
  Dashboard (calendar, bookings, ICS).
- **Agent C --- Media & Search:** S3 pipelines, image transforms,
  Typesense indexing & search, amenity facets.
- **Agent D --- Policy & Ops:** Verification Lite (OCR+geocode),
  surveillance disclosure enforcement, hazards, post‑booking adjustments
  & deposit capture, notifications.
