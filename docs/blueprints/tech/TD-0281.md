4884. **Rollback**: web/API/search rollback completed within target time
      (≤ 10 minutes).
4885. **Cost**: budget alarms functional; logs retention policies apply.

## **1.29.19 Acceptance criteria --- mark §1.29 FINAL only when ALL true**

4891. All readiness gates G1--G10 are **green**; dress rehearsal &
      rollback completed.
4892. DNS/CloudFront cutover executed with ≤ 5 minutes of elevated
      4xx/5xx and **no downtime**.
4893. Robots/sitemaps/hreflang canonicalization active; CWV p75 and API
      p95 remain within budgets at T+24h.
4894. Stripe webhooks & payouts verified in prod; refund kernel active;
      email/SMS deliverability verified.
4895. War room operational; status page live; incident comms templates
      in use.
4896. Search & cache pre‑warm effective; zero‑results & latency stable;
      Safe‑Mode invariant holds.
4897. Rollback playbooks validated; cost budgets/alerts active; no P0
      incidents in T+72h.

### **Gate decision for §1.29 (your rule)**

I have re‑audited this subsection against your non‑technical plan's
launch expectations. With **timeline, cutover, SEO, payments/messaging
readiness, monitoring, risks, rollback, tests, artifacts, and
acceptance** fully specified, **§1.29 meets the ≥99.9% bar** and is
implementation‑ready.

# **§1.30 --- Post‑Launch Growth & SRE Handover**

**Full Technical Development Plan (single copy‑paste block for your
master doc)**

**Purpose.** Operate the platform safely and cost‑efficiently after GA
while accelerating growth. Define a 30/60/90‑day operating plan,
ownership handoffs, change management, reliability program (SLOs/error
budgets), ongoing SEO/ASO/Growth systems, FinOps cadence, and a living
runbook library. This section assumes the production stack described
earlier: **Amplify Hosting Gen‑2**, **AppSync**, **Lambda**, **Aurora
Serverless v2**, **S3/CloudFront**, **Typesense on ECS Fargate**,
**EventBridge**, **Stripe**; and that all Safe‑Mode and privacy controls
(SFW/PII) remain in force.

## **1.30.1 Objectives & invariants**

4898. **Reliability first**: protect SLOs; error budgets govern pace of
      change.
4899. **Cost discipline**: serverless where possible; scale only with
      proven demand; budgets & anomaly detection on.
4900. **Experiment always‑on**: growth tests run with guardrails (SRM
      checks, CUPED/Bayesian) and **no SEO cloaking**.
4901. **SEO/On‑site optimization is continuous**: alignment with §1.17
      and §1.20; structured data and CWV budgets enforced.
4902. **Security & privacy unchanged**: Safe‑Mode on public,
      consent‑gated marketing, DSAR within SLA.
4903. **Documented ownership**: every service has a clear owner, on‑call
      path, and runbook.

## **1.30.2 30 / 60 / 90‑day operating plan**

**T+0--30 days (Stabilize & Verify)**

- **War‑room cadence**: daily 15‑min checks on SLOs (web/API p95,
  checkout success, search CTR, zero‑result%).
- **Hotlist burn‑down**: errors/regressions from launch week fixed
  first; no risky ramps until error budget \< 30% burned.
- **SEO**: verify indexation of top landings; fix any crawl anomalies;
  lighthouse CI on mobile keeps CWV p75 green.
- **Growth pilots**: 2--3 low‑risk experiments (e.g., search empty‑state
  copy, "book again" reminder timing, verified‑chip visual weight).
- **FinOps**: confirm budgets by service, turn on
