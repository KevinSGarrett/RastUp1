n (spend vs allocated), liability for

I\) Runbooks & Controls

Runbooks

Payout incident (bank failure, mass retry)

Processor outage (fallback queueing; disable card/ACH flags in §4.14.2)

Chargeback surge (triage, autopack templates, Ops notice)

Deposit expiry wave (bulk void)

Promo misconfig (rollback via §4.14.2; compute refunds vs credits)

Controls

Twoperson approvals on moneycritical actions

Daily variance thresholds (alert if \> \$X or \> Y bps)

Access logging for payouts; download/export reasons captured

J\) Metrics & Alerts

Dashboards

Net takerate by city/role; processor cost %; payout failure rate;
reserve coverage; refund rate; chargeback rate & win %; deposit capture
volume; Early Payout usage & fee yield; promo burn vs budget

Alerts

Takerate drop \> 100 bps dayoverday

Payout failure spike \> 0.5%

Chargebacks opened \> Z/day or win rate \< target

Deposit auths expiring in next 24h \> threshold

Promo burn \> budget

L\) Acceptance Criteria (mark 4.14.6 FINAL)

Payout batches with retry/changebank and reserve visibility; Early
Payout peruse with fee math.

Reserves (newprovider & rolling) configurable via §4.14.2; applied &
released with schedules.

Refunds/Adjustments recompute fees/taxes and issue amended receipts
automatically.

Studio deposits: holds visible; capture/void/release with evidence and
dualapproval \> threshold; separate receipt.

Chargebacks: webhook ingestion, evidence pack builder, representment
submission, payout freezes.

Coupons/Promos: create/manage; burn tracking; wallet line items posted.

Reconciliation & RevRec exports: daily variances, monthend packs,
escrow/tax/deposit liabilities tieouts.

Runbooks & Alerts documented and wired; telemetry events emitted;
dashboards live.

M\) Why this works

Ops speed without risk: common money flows are oneclick with calculators
and dual approvals.

Clean books by default: escrow vs revenue vs liabilities handled
consistently; audits are painless.

Loss containment: reserves, evidence packs, and alerts reduce chargeback
and refund leakage.

Citybycity control: economics tuned in §4.14.2; Finance executes without
code.

§4.14.7 --- Tax & Compliance Ops

Goal: Operate U.S. taxes and compliance without code changes: collect
W9s, resolve TIN mismatches, run and deliver 1099s, manage marketplace
salestax (destinationbased) with a tax engine, file remittances on time,
and keep a defensible audit trail---with dual approvals on sensitive
moves.

A\) Scope & Roles

Who uses this: Finance (lead), Tax & Compliance, Readonly Auditor;
limited Support (view-only for ticket replies).\
What it covers: W9 onboarding & edelivery consent, TIN matching, 1099
generation/efile/delivery/corrections, marketplace salestax nexus

calendar, audit pack exports.
