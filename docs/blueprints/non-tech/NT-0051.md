nch)

Base 15 GB for all; 30 GB when ID Verified; 50 GB when Trusted Pro or
Rep ≥ 85.

Large sets can use external links (Drive/Dropbox); platform captures a
manifest (name/size/checksum) for disputes.

Revisit storage billing only if \>5% of active users routinely hit
ceilings and costs materially increase.

G\) Messaging health & antispam (no paytospam)

Monthly 40 newconversation credits; +20 for ID Verified; +20 for Trusted
Pro (max 80).

Credits autoreplenish monthly; extra credit purchases disabled at
launch.

"Nudge" limit: 1 priority nudge / thread / day; abuse throttled;
repeated violations reduce newconversation caps.

H\) Fairness & ranking guardrails (immutable)

Relevance first: query fit → availability → distance → price → Rep
tiebreak → Verified/Trusted nudges.

Paid visibility caps: strict density limits; clear Promoted labels;
never outrank better matches.

Safety gating: Boosts & RFP broadcasts require ID Verified, Rep ≥ 70, no
recent strikes.

I\) Launch promos (transactionfirst; timeboxed by city)

0% buyer fee on first booking in launch cities.

--2% provider fee for first 60 days postlaunch (stackaware; respects 9%
floor).

Verification subsidies: cover part of ID cost for the first 300
signups/city; \$15 coupon on passing Background.

City promos rendered as strikethrough on fee lines (e.g., "Buyer fee
\~5%\~ → 0%").

J\) When (and only when) to add an optional Pro plan later

Introduce a voluntary Pro tier only if all triggers are true in ≥ 2
launch cities:

Liquidity: Search→Inquiry ≥ 20%; Inquiry→Booking ≥ 35%; Repeat bookings
≥ 30%.

Willingness to pay: ≥ 20% of active providers repeatedly buy Boosts/RFP
credits.

Pro uplift proof: Piloted Pro features show ≥ 20% conversion/GMV lift
vs. control.

Community health: NPS ≥ 45 and Pro does not depress Free engagement.

If/when launched: keep Pro optional and valueadd (e.g., monthly Boost
stipend, advanced analytics, concierge), never required for
discoverability.

K\) Metrics to watch (prove we chose right)

Activation: % of new providers publishing ≥ 1 package within 7 days → \>
50%.

Messaging health: Median first response time ≤ 2 hours; abuse reports \<
0.3 / 100 conversations.

Verification adoption: ID ≥ 60%, Trusted Pro ≥ 15% by day 60 in a city.

Unit economics: Booking net (per §3.1) positive in ≥ 95% of
transactions; smallorder min protects margin.

Boost ROI: Median paid Boost yields ≥ 2.5× incremental GMV.

Repeat: 30%+ repeat bookings within 90 days in mature launch city.

L\) Acceptance criteria (to mark 3.2 FINAL)

No subscriptions at launch; no paid storage; no paid DM packs.

Feature gates/perks are driven by Verification, Trusted Pro, and
Reputation, not payment.

Search Boost, Featured, RFP credits implemented as usagebased with
eligibility gates, labels, and density caps.

Early Payout available peruse for qualified providers.

Storage tiers increase via verification/reputation; externallink
manifesting implemented.

Messaging credit system live; abuse throttles; "nudge" limits enforced.

Launch promos configurable per city/cohort (fee holidays, provider fee
reductions, verification subsidies).

Dashboards: activation, verification adoption, Boost ROI, unit
economics, response times, repeat bookings.

M\) Why this works (launch economics & growth)

Removes adoption friction that hurt legacy platforms (no "pay to
participate").

Aligns incentives --- we profit when users profit (commission), not
before.

Builds trust at scale --- earned perks (verification/reputation) boost
safety and conversion.

Keeps options open --- once liquidity and ROI are proven, we can add an
optional Pro that power users want to pay for.

Notes for §3.1 consistency (already reflected)

Keep 12% provider / 5% buyer (min \$3; 3% ACH); Instant Book --1%,
Trusted Pro --0.5%, highvalue tier 10% above \$1,000; floor 9%.

Early Payout is peruse (0.5%) and eligibilitybased --- not tied to any
subscription.
