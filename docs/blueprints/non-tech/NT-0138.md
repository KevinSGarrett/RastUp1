Q\) Why this works

Opsspeed changes without code keep docs and comms aligned with live
policy and city conditions.

Pinned, signed, and hashed records raise trust and win
disputes/chargebacks.

Role and cityaware assembly means one source supports many scenarios,
cleanly.

Guardrails & approvals prevent risky edits from slipping into
production.

§4.14.11 --- Studios Ops

Goal: Operate the studio side of the marketplace without code changes:
verify studios, enforce House Rules & deposits, manage coverage by
neighborhood, keep checkin smooth and safe, and tie studios cleanly into
LBG (Linked Booking Group) flows with talent---while preserving SFW
standards and strong audit trails.

A\) Scope, Roles & Guardrails

Who uses this: Studios Ops (lead), Trust & Safety, City Ops, Support,
Finance, Content Moderation, Readonly Auditor.\
What it controls: studio onboarding & verification, listing standards,
amenities taxonomy, House Rules packs, deposit defaults & captures,
access/"lockout" handling, safety & compliance fields, visibility in
search/featured, coverage heatmaps, and LBG ties.

Guardrails:

"Studio Verified" badge requires documentation + photo checks; twoperson
approval to revoke badges or capture deposits \> cap (§4.14.6).

No explicit sets; previews must remain SFW (enforced via §4.14.4).

Address privacy: exact address never public preconfirmation;
neighborhood shown until accept.

B\) Studio Onboarding & Verification

Onboarding checklist (adminconfigurable in §4.14.10):

Identity & ownership (choose 1+): lease/utility bill, business
registration, or property manager letter.

Address proof: document + GPSstamped photos (entrance, main room, key
amenities).

Minimum photos (≥12): wide + detail shots; safety items (first aid,
exits) included.

House Rules pack applied (from CMS) with required fields (access,
occupancy, noise, hazards).

Deposits setting (optional): % + cap (defaults from §4.14.2).

Safety & compliance fields: smoke detectors, fire extinguishers, ADA
access, elevators/stairs, parking, neighborhood notes.

Contact method for dayof (masked relay); optional codelock provider
field (logs may be uploaded).

Verification console actions:

Approve / Request changes / Reject (with reasons & examples).

Badge: Studio Verified; badge expires on reverify cadence (12--18 mo).

Reverify queue with reminder emails, autodowngrade if overdue.

Amenity taxonomy (managed in §4.14.2): cyclorama, natural light,
blackout, sound treatment, dressing room, kitchenette, showers, parking,
freight elevator, seamless paper, Cstands, strobes, modifiers,
backdrops, props.\
