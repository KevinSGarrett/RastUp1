Financial Modeling Disclaimer: This section provides planning
assumptions, formulas, and structures for internal modeling. It is not a
forecast or financial advice. All sample numbers are illustrative;
replace with real inputs once telemetry in §5 is live.

Context & Alignment: We operate a US‑only creative marketplace
connecting models, photographers, videographers, and content creators
with buyers and studios. Launch strategy is subscription‑free;
monetization is via take‑rate on bookings and usage‑based promotions
(capped, labeled, eligibility‑gated). Public content is artistic‑only;
deliverables use external storage with immutable manifests. Instant Book
requires ID verification; background checks are opt‑in (Trusted Pro).
ACH reduces buyer fee to 3% where enabled. Feature flags and city gates
control rollout; admin tools and audits turn policy into software.

Goals:\
• Identify all variable costs tied directly to transactions and
exposure.\
• Model processor fees for card vs ACH correctly; capture per‑event
costs (IDV, BG, tax, comms, safety).\
• Keep COGS low without compromising safety or compliance.

Key variables & baselines:\
• Card processing: Assume \~2.9% + \$0.30 per card charge (authorization
and capture as applicable); 3DS where required.\
• ACH processing: Assume \~0.5--0.8% effective with caps; returns
handling cost per event.\
• ID verification: Per‑check cost; subsidized for early cohorts; later
user‑paid or bundled in Trusted Pro pricing.\
• Background checks: Pass‑through or partially subsidized; include
adverse‑action processing overhead.\
• Tax engine: Per transaction quote + monthly minimum;
refunds/amendments charged per credit memo.\
• Content safety: Classifier scans per media; human moderation minutes
for escalations.\
• E‑signature: Per envelope for SOW/releases; negotiated tiers.\
• SMS/email: Per SMS/segment and email send; deliverability monitoring.\
• Chargeback fees: Per dispute fee; lost cases incur processor fees;
representment labor cost.\
• Invalid‑click credits: Reducing promotions revenue; monitoring and
auto‑credit pipeline cost.

Core formulas (structure; plug real telemetry later):\
• ProcessorCOGS_t = Σ (CardCharges_j × (rate% × amount_j + \$0.30)) + Σ
(ACHDebits_k × (ach_rate% × amount_k))\
• TrustSafetyCOGS_t = IDV_checks × IDV_unit_cost + BG_checks ×
BG_unit_cost + Moderation_minutes × cost_per_min\
• TaxCOGS_t = TaxQuotes × quote_cost + CreditMemos × memo_cost\
• CommsCOGS_t = SMS_segments × sms_cost + Emails × email_cost\
• ChargebackCOGS_t = Disputes × dispute_fee + Losses × lost_rev_effect

External deliverables keep hosting COGS low:\
By using external storage for heavy media, we avoid large variable
storage and egress costs. We still incur classifier and moderation costs
on thumbnails and metadata.

Unit cost levers:\
Negotiating ACH pricing, batching signatures into envelopes, and
training classifiers to reduce human moderation minutes are key levers
on COGS.

Attribution discipline:\
COGS must reconcile with usage events in §5; finance uses event counts ×
unit costs and cross‑checks with vendor invoices and Admin exports.

Instrumentation & success metrics:\
• COGS % of GMV and % of revenue; processor cost per \$ collected (card
vs ACH)\
• Moderation minutes per 1,000 media items; IDV/BG adoption vs subsidy
spend\
• Tax engine latency and success rate; credit memo accuracy; chargeback
win rate

Top risks & mitigations:\
• Processor fee creep → monitor effective rate; negotiate with volume;
shift mix to ACH where eligible\
• Under‑resourced moderation → safety risk; over‑moderation → creator
churn; balance with training and examples\
• Tax misconfiguration → reconciliation variance; keep allowlist tight
and audited

Acceptance checklist:\
□ COGS model wired to vendor usage; reconciliation report green for 30
days.\
□ ACH return macros and fee handling tested; chargeback kit process
audited.\
□ Content safety staffing plan in place for peak loads.
