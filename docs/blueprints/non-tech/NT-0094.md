o 3×/day
platformwide (ratelimited).

Explainers: tooltip "Followers ≠ engagement" + definitions of ER per
platform.

Cards show compact chips like IG 182k • 2.8% ER / TT 520k • 110k avg
views with a tiny verified tick when sourced via API.

F\) Results List, Map & Cards

Cards: PersonCard(role) or StudioCard (from §4.2).

Promotions: clearlylabeled Promoted units appear within capped slots (≤
2 in top 20, ≤ 1 above the fold); they must match filters.

Map pins: price or role icon; hover/press syncs with the card; keyboard
accessible.

Inline actions: Message, Add to Board, View, Invite (from buyer brief
context).

AttachinFlow (talent searches with date/time): a blue pill "Attach a
Studio" appears above the list; opens the prefiltered Studio drawer (top
3 suggestions inline).

Empty states:

Show nearby neighborhoods, "widen radius," "adjust budget," "broaden
date window," or switch role.

Offer a Save Search with current filters.

G\) Sorting & Ranking

Sort options: Best match (default) • Price • Distance • Availability
first • Rating • Reputation.

Ranking (default Best match):

Exact filter fit (role/amenities/social thresholds)

Availability match (date/time fit; for studios, slot + min hours; for
people, IB window or calendar)

Distance (within radius)

Price fit (within selected or inferred range)

Reputation Score (rolespecific; studiospecific for spaces)

Tiebreak nudges: Verified/Trusted/Verified Studio • Instant Book •
Freshness (recent calendar update)

Fairness: Paid units never bypass filter or ranking contract; they
occupy their own labeled, capped slots.

H\) Saved Searches & Alerts

Save Search captures all filters (including social panel logic); users
name it and pick alert cadence (daily batch by default).

Email/push previews respect Safe Mode (no 18+ imagery).

Management: /saved-searches lets users rename, change cadence, or
delete.

I\) Boards, Compare & Brief Integration

Add to Board from any card; boards can mix People & Studios (type badges
visible).

Compare (from a board or brief): sidebyside with key fields and rep.

Invite (buyer context): from search cards directly send Smart Invites;
prefills brief context.

Attach a Studio: from talent search with date/time or from brief review
step.

J\) Performance, Accessibility & Quality

Performance: route codesplit; image srcset + lazyload; skeletons render
within 100ms; target TTI \< 2.5s on 3G Fast.

Accessibility: keyboardable filters & map; ARIA tabs; clear focus
states; card actions readable by screen readers.

Quality: show "metrics stale" badge if social metrics \> 72h old;
"calendar stale" badge if not updated for 30 days (optional nudge).

K\) Telemetry

search.open (role\|studio) • filters.open/apply/reset • sort.change •
map.toggle

social_panel.apply (platforms, any\|all, verified_only=true\|false) •
metrics.refresh

card.view (type=person\|studio, promoted=true\|false) •
card.action.message/add_board/invite

attach_studio.open/select • saved_search.create/toggle

empty_state.save_search • rank.debug_sample (privacysafe sampling to
validate ranking fairness)

L\) Acceptance Criteria (mark 4.6 FINAL)

Role/Listing tabs implement
Model/Photographer/Videographer/Creator/FanSub Creator/Studio with
SafeMode gating for FanSub & beyondLingerie People.

Filter sets delivered for each role and for Studio (amenities, min
hours, etc.); Common filters present across all.

Social Metrics Panel supports perplatform followers/ER/avg views/growth;
ANY/ALL logic; Verifiedonly default with Include selfreported toggle;
nightly sync + manual refresh (3×/day).

Results list uses PersonCard / StudioCard; Promoted units are labeled
and capped (≤2/20; ≤1 above fold).

Attach a Studio pill appears when a People search includes date/time;
drawer shows prefiltered studios; selection persists to checkout as
Linked Booking Group.

Sorting & ranking match the contract: relevance → availability →
distance → price fit → reputation → small nudges; paid never overrides
