no credit checks for creators.\
• Use: report is used solely to grant or deny Trusted Pro; not for
unrelated decisions; no sharing with other users.\
• Adverse action: if considering a negative decision, send pre‑adverse
notice with report copy and rights; wait required period before final
decision.\
• Disputes: if user disputes accuracy, pause action until vendor
resolves; document outcomes; re‑evaluate decision.\
• Data retention: store minimal artifacts; delete per vendor and legal
schedules; restrict admin access with training.

Procedures & Operational Playbooks:\
• Flow: consent capture → vendor run → results to restricted queue →
decision template (approve/consider/insufficient) → notice steps (if
consider) → final outcome → badge or denial.\
• Training: FCRA basics for Trust admins; scripts for notices; time‑zone
aware waiting periods.\
• Vendor audits: quarterly SLAs, dispute timelines, and data security
attestations.

Enforcement & Remedies:\
• Outcomes: approve (badge issued), insufficient (ask for resubmission),
pre‑adverse + adverse (with required waits), appeal path if new
information supplied.\
• Misuse: any admin misuse is a severe policy breach; logs reviewed;
employment actions may result.

Data, Privacy & Retention:\
• PII vault for reports; masked views by default; access logs reviewed;
retention periods enforced; legal hold overrides documented.\
• End‑user privacy: no sharing of report content with other users; we
surface only badge/no‑badge and generic safety copy.

Templates & Required Notices (internal/external):\
• Templates: consent form; pre‑adverse notice; adverse action notice;
dispute intake; approval email; badge explainer.\
• Admin checklists: steps for each outcome; timers for waiting periods;
escalation paths.

Compliance Metrics & Audits:\
• Completion time; adverse action accuracy; dispute resolution time;
badge adoption; appeal success rates; access‑log anomalies.

Risks & Mitigations:\
• Jurisdictional variation → vendor handles localization; we allow city
gates if requirements differ.\
• Over‑reliance on checks → emphasize that reviews and reputation remain
primary; do not imply \'guarantee\' of safety.

Acceptance Checklist (ready to externalize):\
□ Consent screens tested; vendor contract signed; admin training
completed; notice templates reviewed by counsel; badge logic validated
in search and fees.

Deep Dive: Scenario --- Unsafe off‑platform interaction: intake,
escalation, and law‑enforcement coordination.\
We capture intake checklists, decision trees, and user messaging; list
admin actions; define audit fields; and annotate guardrails. We avoid
legal conclusions in user‑facing copy and defer to counsel where
necessary, while keeping product/ops steps executable.
