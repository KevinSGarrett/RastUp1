sts. Deliverables are handled
via external links (Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests. Instant
Book requires ID verification; background checks are opt‑in (Trusted
Pro). Payments include card (3DS when required) and ACH (with a reduced
buyer fee). Feature flags and city gates control blast radius, and the
Admin Console enables Support, Trust, Finance, and Ops to act without
code changes.

Goals:\
• Establish an incident framework with clear roles, SEV levels, and
rollback powers.\
• Practice drills that reflect our highest‑risk surfaces: checkout, tax,
moderation, promotions.\
• Document feature‑flag recipes that safely degrade functionality.

Roles & SEV:\
□ Incident Commander (IC) + Comms + Ops + Eng; SEV‑0/1/2 matrix with
SLAs.\
□ Pager rotations; escalation tree; status page policies; customer comms
templates.

Flag recipes:\
□ Disable promotions; reduce density to zero; keep organic ranking
intact.\
□ Checkout degrade: force card when ACH engine degraded; allow \'pending
tax\' path with banner.\
□ Safe‑Mode hardening: increase thresholds; pause new media ingestion;
keep messaging live.\
□ Admin controls: kill‑switches for money moves require two‑person
approval.

Drills:\
□ Quarterly disaster day with switchbacks; capture MTTA/MTTR;
retrospective with action items.\
□ Vendor outage simulations: processor, tax, IDV; confirm fallbacks.\
□ Data corruption simulation: DQ gates trigger; freeze dashboards;
recover from backups.

Owners & Roles:\
• SRE/Platform --- incident framework and drills.\
• Product leads --- flag recipes and blast radii.\
• Trust/Finance --- guardrails for money/safety degradations.\
• Support --- comms and macros.

Instrumentation & Readiness Signals:\
• MTTA/MTTR; incidents by SEV; error budget burn; flags toggled; status
page updates; support volume surge and SLA.

Top Risks & Mitigations:\
• Unclear authority in crisis → written runbooks; regular practice.\
• Regression after rollback → smoke tests; post‑incident QA; changelog
discipline.

Acceptance Criteria (Go/No‑Go):\
✓ At least one multi‑surface drill passed per quarter.\
✓ All flag recipes tested in sandbox and once in production under
controlled conditions.\
✓ Status page and comms templates verified; on‑call schedules posted.

Scenario Playbook --- Processor partial outage:\
Trigger: Spike in card declines; webhook lag\
Response: Prefer ACH; pause promotions; display safe banner; queue
retries; coordinate with processor.\
Roll‑back/Forward: Enable normal flows gradually; audit duplicates.\
Owner: SRE/Payments \| Telemetry: decline_rate, webhook_lag \| User
Copy: "Some card payments are impacted---try ACH or retry shortly."

Scenario Playbook --- Moderation surge from viral post:\
Trigger: Queue length \> threshold\
Response: Tighten Safe‑Mode; pause new media; reassign staff; inform
users.\
Roll‑back/Forward: Reopen after backlog clears.\
Owner: Trust \| Telemetry: queue_length, SLA \| User Copy: "We're
reviewing more uploads than usual; thanks for your patience."

Implementation Notes:\
• Flags & City Gates: Every user‑visible change ships behind a flag with
a documented blast radius, an owner, and a rollback plan. City
allowlists prevent accidental national exposure. Admin has kill‑switches
for money and safety features with two‑person approval.\
• Admin Operability: No checklist is \'done\' unless Support can resolve
the top 3 edge cases without engineering and Trust can perform required
actions with an audit trail.\
• Help‑Center Alignment: All user‑facing copy is mirrored in the help
center with last‑updated dates and visual examples. We avoid legal
jargon; we explain outcomes and next steps.\
• QA Strategy: We prefer production‑like staging with seeded data and
synthetic bookings. We test under simulated load, outage, and edge cases
(ACH returns, 3DS failures, moderation queue spikes).\
• Holdouts & Experiments: Promotions, ranking, and any economic nudges
run with control cells and pre‑registered guardrails. We pause
experiments wh
