launch 7/30/90‑day reviews and §8 compliance calendar. • Where a
risk spans multiple squads, the city GM or Risk DRI chairs the review;
actions have due dates. • We prefer reversible changes (flags) and
narrow blast radius (city gates). • We avoid \'security by obscurity\';
we publish clear user guidance, train staff, and keep audit trails for
all sensitive actions. • The risk register itself is versioned; changes
record rationale and observed metrics.

Execution Notes:\
• Every risk has a dashboard tile with an owner, a definition of the
denominator, and a weekly narrative. • Risk reviews pair with §10

§11.4 --- Data & Security Risks (PII, Admin Abuse, Vendor, Secrets)

Risk & Process Disclaimer: This section is an internal risk‑management
blueprint. It does not constitute legal, tax, or security advice.
Coordinate with counsel and security leaders before externalizing any
policy or committing to obligations. All examples are illustrative and
must be adapted to the realities measured in Section 5 dashboards.

Context & Alignment: US‑only marketplace launch; subscription‑free
start; monetization via take‑rate and usage‑based promotions with strict
eligibility and caps. Public content is artistic‑only with Safe‑Mode
defaults for guests. Deliverables are exchanged via external links
(Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests; escrowed payments release on
acceptance. Instant Book requires ID verification; background checks are
opt‑in (Trusted Pro). Rollouts are city‑gated behind feature flags.
Admin Console enforces least‑privilege, JIT elevation, two‑person
approvals, and full audit trails.
