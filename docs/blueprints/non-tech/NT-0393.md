e change ships behind a flag with
a documented blast radius, an owner, and a rollback plan. City
allowlists prevent accidental national exposure. Admin has kill‑switches
for money and safety features with two‑person approval.\
• Admin Operability: No checklist is \'done\' unless Support can resolve
the top 3 edge cases without engineering and Trust can perform required
actions with an audit trail.\
• Help‑Center Alignment: All user‑facing copy is mirrored in the help
center with last‑updated dates and visual examples. We avoid legal
jargon; we explain outcomes and next steps.\
• QA Strategy: We prefer production‑like staging with seeded data and
synthetic bookings. We test under simulated load, outage, and edge cases
(ACH returns, 3DS failures, moderation queue spikes).\
• Holdouts & Experiments: Promotions, ranking, and any economic nudges
run with control cells and pre‑registered guardrails. We pause
experiments when guardrails breach.\
• Close‑the‑Loop: Post‑launch, we hold 7/30/90‑day reviews that tie
metrics to actions and retire ineffective steps.

Implementation Notes:\
• Flags & City Gates: Every user‑visible change ships behind a flag with
a documented blast radius, an owner, and a rollback plan. City
allowlists prevent accidental national exposure. Admin has kill‑switches
for money and safety features with two‑person approval.\

eligibility and caps, and keep public media within an artistic‑only
boundary with Safe‑Mode defaults for g
