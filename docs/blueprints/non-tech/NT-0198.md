§7.0 --- Overview & Org Principles

Context: We are launching a US‑only creative marketplace focused on
models, photographers, videographers, and content creators, with buyers
and studios as complementary roles. The business choices already
ratified are: subscription‑free launch; take‑rate monetization with
usage‑based promotions that are eligibility‑gated and capped;
city‑by‑city go‑to‑market beginning in Houston with nationwide signups
allowed; artistic‑nudity‑only policy for public surfaces; external
deliverables via Drive/Dropbox manifests; daily finance close; ACH with
buyer‑fee discount; Instant Book gated by ID verification; optional
background checks; and feature‑flagged rollouts with strong admin
tooling and audit trails.

Goals:\
• Codify how we organize to ship safely and quickly.\
• Align incentives across product, trust, finance, growth, and studios.\
• Make feature flags, admin tooling, and audit trails normal, not
exceptions.

Why this matters:\
This sub‑section operationalizes choices we made across
