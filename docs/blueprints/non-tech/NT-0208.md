a versions; we avoid raw webhook coupling.\
• Feature flags: we version flags, document blast radius, and wire
kill‑switches (Admin → Config) with two‑person approval for money
moves.\
• Admin operability: before general release of any surface, Support must
demonstrate resolution of the top three expected edge cases without
engineering.\
• Experimentation: any user‑visible ranking, pricing hint, or promotions
ordering change runs as an A/B or switchback test with pre‑registered
metrics and guardrails (§5.13).\
• Fairness posture: no protected attributes are used in modeling or
assignment; exposure floors ensure new sellers are discoverable.\
• Security: least‑privilege RBAC for admin roles (§4.14.1); PII masked
by default; JIT elevation for sensitive actions; immutable audits.\
• City gating: risky changes (promotions inventory, tax expansion,
studios deposits) are rolled out city‑by‑city with measurable acceptance
gates.\
• Close‑the‑loop: every process has an owner, a dashboard, and a
mechanism to retire or revise it when it no longer serves the intended
outcome.

Implementation notes:\
• Data contracts: every event used here is defined in §5.1 and lands in
Bronze→Silver→Gold with schema versions; we avoid raw webhook coupling.\
• Feature flags: we version flags, document blast radius, and wire
kill‑switches (Admin → Config) with two‑person approval for money
moves.\

§7.2 --- Headcount Ramp & Budget (by Function & Phase)

Context: We are launching a US‑only creative marketplace focused on
models, photographers, videographers, and content creators, with buyers
and studios as complementary roles. The business choices already
ratified are: subscription‑free launch; take‑rate monetization with
usage‑based promotions that are eligibility‑gated and capped;
city‑by‑city go‑to‑market beginning in Houston with nationwide signups
allowed; artistic‑nudity‑only policy for public surfaces; external
deliverables via Drive/Dropbox manifests; daily finance close; ACH with
buyer‑fee discount; Instant Book gated by ID verification; optional
background checks; and feature‑flagged rollouts with strong admin
tooling and audit trails.

Goals:\
• Plan hires that unlock the next milestone without over‑staffing.\
• Map headcount to revenue milestones and cost envelopes.\
• Keep contractors in low‑leverage lanes; hire for durable ownership in
high‑leverage lanes.

Why this matters:\
This sub‑section operationalizes choices we made across Sections 1--6.
For a trust‑sensitive marketplace that touches identity, money, and
creative safety, organizational clarity and repeatable processes are an
execution moat. Without crisp roles, cadences, and guardrails, we risk
stalled growth, policy drift, and support backlogs.

Operating principles:\
• Split teams by value stream (discovery/booking, money/tax,
trust/safety, promotions/growth, studios) rather than by technical
layer.\
• Treat admin and analytics surfaces as first‑class product; if support
cannot resolve an edge case without code, the feature is not done.\
• Ship beh
