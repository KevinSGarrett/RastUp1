ponses; enable responsetime score nudge;
suggest Quick Replies; rotate out of carousels until improved.

(Each playbook sets flags/keys in §4.14.2 and schedules comms/templates
in §4.14.10.)

K\) Integrations

Promotions (§4.14.8): CPC floors per city×role, Featured price ladders,
eligibility.

Verification (§4.13): subsidy counts, Trusted Pro gating.

Support (§4.14.5): relocation list for studio access failures.

Finance (§4.14.6): budgets, credits, ledger posting.

Smart Docs (§4.14.10): invite templates, event emails, House Rules
packs.

Search (§4.14.2): facet toggles (e.g., show "Touring talent" filter in
launch window).

L\) Metrics & Alerts

KPIs

Activation: % of invited providers who publish packages in 7 days
(target \> 50%).

Verified coverage by role (target ≥ thresholds above).

Inquiry→Booking conversion (target ≥ 35% by W+8).

Repeat booking % (target ≥ 30% by M3).

Responsetime median ≤ 2h; IB share ≥ 35%.

Studio coverage (neighborhood count) and LBG adoption.

Perk efficiency: CAC per verified, cost/booking from subsidies, Boost
ROAS by cohort.

Alerts

Balancedratio violation \> 2 weeks.

Verified coverage dips \< threshold.

Budget burn ≥ 80% with \< 60% target achieved.

Carousel impression concentration (top 10 profiles \> 40% impressions).

N\) Acceptance Criteria (mark 4.14.9 FINAL)

City Dashboard with rolesplit health, heatmaps, alerts.

Targets & ratios editable with guardrails; live comparison to actuals.

Cohort Builder & Invites with filters, CSV import, dedupe, autoinvite
rules, and conversion tracking.

Foundingcity perks (buyerfee holiday, provider nudge, verification
subsidies, Boost credits) with budgets and eligibility.

Rotations for "Top in {City}" with fairness caps and optional manual
pinning (timeboxed).

Studio seeding tools (coverage map, outreach, Verified gating, LBG
integration).

Demand seeding (brand RFP broadcast, concierge pipeline, casestudy
publishing).

Local events builder (Collab Days, tours) with RSVP/waitlist and
postevent followups.

Playbooks that programmatically set flags/keys and schedule comms;
oneclick apply/rollback.

Metrics, alerts, telemetry implemented and visible; budgets enforced.

O\) Why this works

Citybycity control aligns product knobs with ground truth (coverage,
ratios, response time).

Seeding at scale: invites, perks, and events run from one place with
budgets and eligibility baked in.

Fair discovery: rotations with caps prevent "winnertakeall," improving
breadth of bookings.

Tight integration with Promotions, Verification, Finance, and Support
ensures moves are both effective and auditable.

§4.14.10 --- Smart Docs & Templates CMS

Goal: Let Ops/Legal/Marketing manage contracts, releases, SOWs, House
Rules, and comms (email/SMS) without code---using a versioned clause
library, safe variables, approvals, localization, and oneclick
rollout/rollback. All documents and messages should be policyaccurate,
esignable, and auditable, and slot cleanly into booking, delivery,
disputes, and receipts.

A\) Scope, Roles & Guardrails

Who uses this:

Legal (owner of legal templates) --- clauses, SOW defaults, releases,
House Rules patterns.

Ops/Support --- dispute macros, houserules packs, city addenda, safety
notices.

Marketing --- email/SMS copy, onboarding & lifecycle.

City Ops --- localized notes, studio packs, event mailers.

Guardrails:

Twoperson approval required to publish legal docs or change variable
sets (Legal + Ops).

Live preview + "blastradius" diff for all publishes.

Version pinning per booking (the exact doc text is frozen on
create/accept).

B\) Document Types & Catalog

Legal/Operational docs (rendered as PDF & HTML):

SOW (Statement of Work) --- per role, roleaware fields
(tale
