RA basics;
chargeback representment; accessibility etiquette.\
• Measurement: we track leading/lagging indicators to tune thresholds
and staffing.

Implementation Notes:\
• Feature Flags & City Gates: externally visible policy toggles ship
behind flags; Admin can rollback with a two‑step confirmation; events
are audited.\
• Admin Operability: every rule has a corresponding tool in Admin
(approve/deny/redact/pause/escalate) with immutable logs.\
• Evidence Hygiene: store hashes and immutable links; redact PII in
views; never edit originals; legal holds override deletion where
applicable.\
• Copy Clarity: explain outcomes and next steps; avoid citing laws in
emails; link to help‑center with examples.\
• Training: quarterly refreshers for T&S, Support, Finance; FCRA basics;
chargeback representment; accessibility etiquette.\
• Measurement: we track leading/lagging indicators to tune thresholds
and staffing.

Context & Alignment: We are launching a US‑only creative marketplace
focused on models, photographers, videographers, and content creators.\
We have chosen a subscription‑free go‑to‑market with monetization via
take‑rate and optional, usage‑based promotions that are
eligibility‑gated and capped.\
Public content is artistic‑nudity‑only; Safe‑Mode defaults for guests
apply. Deliverables are transferred via external storage (Drive/Dropbox)
with immutable manifests.\
Payments flow through card (3DS where required) and ACH (with a
buyer‑fee discount); funds are escrowed and released on acceptance.\
Instant Book is gated by ID verification; background checks are opt‑in
(Trusted Pro). Feature flags and city gates are used for reversible,
auditable launches.\
Admin consoles enable Support, Trust & Safety, Finance, and Ops to
perform routine tasks without code changes.

Goals:\
• Explain money flows plainly and enforce refund/cancellation windows
consistently.\
• Maximize successful representment in disputes by keeping clean records
(escrow, manifests, timestamps).\
• Avoid unfair practices; provide accessible help‑center content that
sets expectations.

Scope & Applicability:\
Applies to all escrowed transactions, ACH and card payments, deposits,
cancellations, and post‑booking adjustments within the US.

Definitions (plain language):\
• Escrow: funds held until acceptance; release triggers defined in §1.3
and §4.12.\
• Change Order: a mutually agreed price/time adjustment posted to the
thread; amends receipts and escrow.\
• Chargeback: cardholder disputes a charge with issuer; we respond with
evidence.\
• ACH Return: bank rejects a debit; we handle via returns codes, fees,
and communication.

Policy Statements:\
• Clear disclosures: fees, taxes, deposits, and refund windows displayed
before purchase and in receipts.\
• Refund bands: time‑based buyer refunds; provider‑fault refunds include
buyer fee; late cancels tracked for reputation.\
• Chargeback playbook: gather SOW, releases, chats, acceptance,
manifest; construct a concise narrative; file within deadline.\
• ACH handling: post returns code; adjust buyer fee if method changes;
reattempt under policy.\
• No cash: off‑platform payments are prohibited within the UI; repeated
attempts can throttle messaging.\
• Tips: zero platform fee; optional and processed post‑completion.

Procedures & Operational Playbooks:\
• Support macros: standard refunds; reschedule; partial refunds;
provider‑fault; chargeback kits.\
• Admin tools: re‑issue receipts; partial refund apportionment; deposit
