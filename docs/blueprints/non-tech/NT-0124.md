L\) Acceptance Criteria (mark 4.14.4 FINAL)

Endtoend upload→screen→publish pipeline with placeholders and subsecond
automated screening.

NSFW classifier, OCR PII, keyword denylist, hash banlist, and virus scan
wired; thresholds configurable via §4.14.2.

Autocrop/blur for previews; hard stops to keep thumbnails SFW; user crop
UI present.

Moderation queues with Priority A/B/C SLAs; decision actions
(approve/blur/remove/escalate).

User notifications with reason codes and appeal flow; taggedcontent
acceptance.

Autosanctions for repeated violations; hard violations escalate to T&S.

Integrations with Search, T&S, Support, Promotions, Verification.

Metrics dashboards and calibration workflow; Telemetry events emitted.

M\) Why this works

SFW by design keeps payment partners comfortable and buyers confident,
while still enabling artistic expression.

Fast automation + human judgment gives scale without losing nuance.

Clear user tools (crop/blur, appeals) reduce friction and educate
creators.

Tunable policies via §4.14.2 let Ops adjust thresholds citybycity
without code

§4.14.5 --- Support & Disputes

Goal: Resolve issues fast, fair, and policyaccurately---with minimal
engineering. Give agents nocode tools to calculate outcomes, capture
evidence, coordinate with Trust/Safety and Finance, and issue amended
receipts/credits with a clear audit trail.

A\) Channels & Intake

Inapp Help → "Report/Resolve a Problem" from: Booking, Chat thread,
Delivery screen, Studio page.

Email & Web form (for loggedout users on brand accounts).

Autocases from signals: missed checkin/out, late/no delivery,
accessfailure events, chargeback opened, payment duplicate, travelfee
dispute, offplatformpayment attempt (flagged).

Intake schema (prefilled from context): booking IDs (LBGaware), role(s),
city, timestamps, house rules/SOW version, deliverables manifest, chat
transcript link, deposit status, verification badges, prior strike
history.

B\) Case Types & Routing

Operational: reschedule, change order, pricing correction, travel fee
dispute.

Nondelivery/Quality: late/no delivery, partial delivery, unusable media.

Attendance: buyer/provider noshow, late arrival (both sides).

Access (Studios): code/lock failure, unsafe conditions, damages/deposit
claims.

Money: duplicate charge, overcharge, refund request, invoice edits, ACH
retry.

Safetycolored: harassment, boundary violations, escorting solicitation
(autolink to §4.14.3).

Payments network: chargeback (card issuer) → evidence pack &
representment.

Routing rules

Safetycolored → T&S queue with Support shadow.

Deposit claims → Support + Finance bin.

LBG cases → "Group" handler with perleg subtabs.

C\) SLAs & Priorities

Priority 0 (Safety): first response ≤ 15--30 min (T&S lead, Support
copilot).

Priority 1 (Access/Noshow/Active booking): first response ≤ 1 h;
resolution target ≤ 24 h.

Priority 2 (Money/Delivery/Quality): first response ≤ 8 h; resolution ≤
72 h.

Priority 3 (General): response ≤ 24 h; resolution ≤ 5 d.

Timers display in case header; breaches flagged and escalated.

D\) Agent Workspace (Case View)

Header: severity, SLA timer, booking chip(s), role(s), city, deposit
state, payouts frozen?, promotions eligibility, strikes.

Timeline: booking events, chat excerpts (expand), delivery manifest
(hashes, sizes), acceptance/rejection log, studio rules snapshot,
location (fuzzed).

Evidence panel: upload files, link docs, annotate; chainofcustody hash.

Policy helper: pulls effective config from §4.14.2 (refund bands,
acceptance window, travel fee bands, deposit defaults).

Calculators drawer (see next).

Actions: refund/partial, credit, deposit capture/void, change order,
reschedule, amended receipt, sanction shortcuts (IB off/DM throttle).
