 trim
friction without compromising safety.

§3.5 --- Brand/Buyer Products (Briefs/RFPs, Shortlists, Concierge,
Delivery)

Goal: Buyers (brands, agencies, studios, solo creators) go from idea →
shortlist → booked → delivered fast, with clear scope, documents,
storagesane delivery, and verifiable outcomes---without subscriptions.
Everything stays fair (relevancefirst), safe (escrow + esign), and
growthfriendly (usagebased RFP credits only).

A\) Principles

Speed with clarity: Briefs produce applestoapples quotes; awarding
triggers escrow, documents, and a Delivery Room automatically.

Relevance over volume: Invite the right providers; broadcast only to
eligible, verified cohorts.

Trustfirst: IDVerified/Trusted Pro gating, esign before checkin,
onplatform escrow & dispute flows.

Storagesane delivery: Originals remain in buyer/provider cloud
(Drive/Dropbox/etc.); platform stores previews + manifests only.

Usagebased monetization: Smart Invite is free; RFP is creditsbased (no
monthly plans, no paywalls).

B\) Buyer Personas & JobstobeDone

Solo/SMB buyer: Needs a model/photographer for a simple shoot; wants
fast quotes and clear outcomes.

Marketing team/agency: Multiseat, needs shortlists, approvals, brand
docs, reporting.

Studio ops: Frequent, repeat bookings; prefers Verified Studios; cares
about schedule reliability.

Creator collab buyer: Seeks socialreach deliverables (IG/TT/YT posts)
with verification and postingwindow guarantees.

C\) Brief Composer (Quick & Full)

Required first step (Quick Brief = \~60s; Full Brief for complex jobs):

Project basics: Role(s), city/radius, date(s)/time(s), duration.

Goal & deliverables: Presets (e.g., "10 edited photos (3kpx), 2 vertical
videos (1080×1920, ≤60s)") + Influence presets (IG Collab, Story
Mentions, TT Post, YT Short) with posting window & min live.

Style refs: Moodboard upload/links; keywords.

Budget: Range or fixed; Budget sanity meter (compares to city/role
median).

Location: Pick Verified Studio or "Buyer provides address" (masked until
award); travel radius/fee toggle.

Eligibility & safety: IDVerified/Trustedonly toggles, NDA toggle, Nudity
& Boundaries (if models involved; artisticnudity only).

Model specifics (if applicable): Look filters + nudity tier + chaperone
policy + social metrics filters.

Timeline: response deadline, delivery date.

Docs preview: Shows the Smart Docs pack (SOW, License, Release, NDA if
toggled) that will autoattach on award.

Privacy: Hide brand name until award (toggle).

D\) Smart Invite & RFP Broadcast

Smart Invite (free):

System suggests 8--15 bestfit providers (role, availability, distance,
price fit, Rep Score, social metrics).

Buyer can edit and send invites (free). Providers get a consolidated
request thread with Quick Quote.

RFP Broadcast (creditsbased):

Sends the brief to a wider pool of eligible providers (IDVerified, Rep ≥
70, no safety flags).

Pricing: credit packs (e.g., 5 for \$29).

Guardrails: min budget floors by city/role/duration; 1 live
broadcast/role per buyer; template checks to reduce spam/underpay.

E\) Proposal & Pricing UX (Provider)

Quick Quote (≈60s): select package, price, availability, short note;
optional addons (travel, extra edits, overtime).

Full Proposal: itemized deliverables (incl. social deliverables),
schedule/milestones, licensing line items, portfolio links.

No proposal peeking: providers don't see others' bids.

F\) Compare & Award (applestoapples + escrow)

Compare view: normalized grid: Price, What's included, Rep Score, Badges
(ID/Trusted/Studio), Travel, Change/Overtime, Social posting window,
Notes.

Fit Score (0--100): assistive signal explaining match to brief (style,
budget, distance, availability).

Award flow: select winner → escrow deposit (default 50%, configurable) →
Smart Docs esign session opens → booking created.

G\) Documents & ESign (Smart Docs)

Autoattach pack on award: Service Agreement/SOW, License/Usage Addendum,
Model Release, Property/Studio Release (if nee
