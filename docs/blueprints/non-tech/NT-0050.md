s: perbooking ledgers + group receipts make refunds,
disputes, and reporting straightforward.

Aligned incentives: IB discount encourages fast conversion; fee tiers
keep highvalue bookings onplatform.

SubSection 3.2 --- Pricing & Tiers (Launch: Start Free, Grow, Then
Monetize in Layers)

Goal: Maximize early adoption and bookings by removing monthly paywalls
and monetizing via takerate (see §3.1) and optional, usagebased addons
that never compromise fairness. Introduce an optional Pro tier only
after we reach liquidity and can prove it increases creator revenue.

A\) Principles (launch stage)

No subscriptions at launch --- free to join, free to list, free to
message within generous fairuse.

Value is earned, not paywalled --- verification, reliability, and
reputation unlock visibility and perks.

Payasyougo, not rent --- Boosts/RFPs are usagebased; no forced bundles.

Fairness & safety first --- paid visibility never outranks relevance or
safety gates.

Monetize later, when proven --- add an optional Pro tier only after
clear, databacked ROI for users.

(pooled across roles).
