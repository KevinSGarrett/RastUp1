g.

Hold & reserves: Higher reserve or payout delay for new/untrusted
accounts, relaxing with reputation.

Duplicate accounts / ban evasion: Device & identity correlation; block
on detection.

Chargeback defense: Autoassemble evidence packet (contracts, chat,
checkins, deliverables logs).

Anticircumvention: Heuristic detection of offplatform payments →
warnings → throttles → suspensions for repeat.

G\) Operations Playbook (internal)

Triage Matrix:

Safety & abuse (SLA fast) → specialized agents

Content moderation → queue with priority for NSFW edge cases

ID/Background verifications → automated + manual exceptions

Fraud/chargebacks → risk team with template evidence

Evidence Retention:

Booking artifacts (contracts, chat logs, checkins, deliverables
manifest) retained 12--24 months; extend on dispute.

PII access limited to T&S and finance staff via rolebased permissions.

Transparency & Appeals:

Users get a decision summary for major actions (what policy, what
evidence).

Appeals allowed once per action except for extreme cases (e.g., verified
criminal activity onplatform).

H\) Incentives that Make Safety "Pay"

J\) MVP vs Phase2

MVP

18+ only, baseline verifications (email/phone), ID verification to
unlock payouts/NSFW/Instant Book

Optional Background Check ("Trusted Pro")

SocialVerified (connect IG/YT/TT)

NSFW gating & automoderation for uploads/messages

Safety flag, block/report, checkin/out timestamps

Enforcement ladder & strike logic; evidence retention minimums

Risk scoring + payout holds for new providers

Phase2

social posts)

Inthread identity recheck (selfie prompt) for suspicious flows

City "safe studios" network curation and promotion

Verified reference letters (offplatform clients/agencies with proof)

K\) Metrics & Alarms (what we measure)

Trust adoption: % ID Verified, % Trusted Pro, % SocialVerified

Safety outcomes: incident rate per 100 bookings, average timetotriage,
repeat offender rate

Reliability: cancellation/noshow rates, ontime rates, response time
medians

Fraud: chargeback rate, offplatform attempt rate, duplicate account hits

Impact: uplift in booking conversion for verified vs nonverified;
dispute rates by verification tier

Guardrail alarms: Incident spike over baseline, surge in offplatform
attempts, sudden drop in verification pass rates, abnormal dispute
clustering.

L\) Acceptance Criteria (for engineering & ops)

Reference statuses and UI tooltips.

Search filters & ranking incorporate verification tiers and reliability
signals.

NSFW gating + automoderation for uploads/messages; human review queue
operational.

Safety Flag → highpriority triage with suppression of Instant Book for
accused until triage.

Checkin/out timestamps; optional generalarea pin; privacy defaults
respected.
