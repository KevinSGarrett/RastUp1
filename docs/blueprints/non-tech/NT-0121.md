ty conflicts: landlord complaints or neighbor incidents →
temporary delist; require documentation.

I\) Buyer & Provider Protections (Immediate Mitigations)

Trusted Contact ping (if enabled) for delayed checkout / SOS keywords.

Relocation: for studio lockout, offer curated alternates (Houston
list) + goodwill credit (config limits in §4.14.2).

Emergency path: surface "Get help now" → safety card (nonlawenforcement
resources) + prompt to contact 911 for imminent danger (we don't
intercept emergencies).

J\) Appeals & Neutral Review

Appeal window: 14 days from sanction; one appeal per case unless new
evidence.

Neutral Review Panel: 2 T&S agents + 1 crossfunction (Support/Legal);
majority rule; document rationale.

Outcome: uphold, downgrade sanction, or overturn; update strike count
and Reputation (§4.10).

Transparency: user receives outcome with policy citations; internal
notes logged.

K\) Integrations & Handoffs

Content: NSFW/preview violations routed to §4.14.4 with case linkage;
content removal reasons synchronized.

Support/Disputes: safetycolored disputes use this case ID; refund
calculators reflect sanctions/policy.

Finance: payout freeze flags; chargeback evidence packs pull T&S
evidence.

Legal & Records: LE requests, subpoenas, child safety referrals via
§4.14.15 with limited PII access.

L\) Metrics & Quality

Operational KPIs

P0/P1 firstresponse SLA hit rate

Time to mitigation (P0 median ≤ 60m)

Safety incident rate per 1,000 bookings (target downward trend)

False positive rate (autosanctions)

Appeal overturn rate (target \< 10%)

Repeat offender rate (strike recurrence within 180 days)

IB suppression count & duration (monitor collateral impact)

Quality controls

Weekly case sampling; peer QA rubric; calibration sessions.

Rule feedback loop: promote/demote rules based on accuracy.

M\) Admin UI --- Trust Console (Key Interactions)

Case detail: timeline, linked entities, evidence panel, sanctions drawer
with reason codes, strike history.

Oneclick controls: IB off/on, DM throttle, Boost suppression, payout
freeze toggle (with reason).

Evidence pack builder: export ZIP/PDF for chargebacks or legal (hashed
manifest).

Policy helper: inline matrix preview (refund/cancellation) based on
city/role at incident time.

N\) Telemetry (Trust & Safety)

ts.case.open (severity, source) • ts.case.upgrade (P1→P0) •
ts.case.resolve (outcome)

ts.evidence.attach (type) • ts.freeze.payout.toggle • ts.ib.toggle

ts.sanction.apply (type=strike1/2/3\|suspend\|disable) •
ts.sanction.expire

ts.rule.fire (rule_id, confidence) • ts.rule.override

ts.appeal.open/resolve (result) • ts.export.pack (purpose)

O\) Acceptance Criteria (mark 4.14.3 FINAL)

Queues & SLAs for P0/P1/P2 with severity chips and timers.

Triage workflow with evidence preservation (hashed), booking/thread
linkage, and immediate controls.

Sanctions ladder implemented (education → throttles → strikes →
suspension/disable) with expiries and autotriggers.

Risk rules engine active; configurable thresholds/weights via §4.14.2;
explainable rule hits.

Background/ID links honored; adverse action flow for background checks.

Studio safety flows: access failure, unsafe conditions, delist/reverify.

Appeals & Neutral Review process with documented outcomes and updates to
Reputation.

Integrations to Content, Support/Disputes, Finance, and Legal; payout
freeze flags honored.

Trust Console UI supports oneclick controls, evidence packs, and policy
helper.

Metrics & QA dashboards live; Telemetry events fire as listed.

P\) Why this works

Fast where it matters (P0/P1 timers, oneclick mitigations) and fair
where it's complex (evidence, neutral review, expiring strikes).

Prevention + response: a configurable rule engine reduces incidents;
strong playbooks resolve the rest.

Auditable endtoend: preserved evidence, hashed manifests, reasoned
decisions, and measured quality.

§4.14.4 --- Content Moderation

Goal: Keep the platform SFW by default, protect users from ha
