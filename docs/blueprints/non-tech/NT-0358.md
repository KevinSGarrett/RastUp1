steps.\
• QA Strategy: We prefer production‑like staging with seeded data and
synthetic bookings. We test under simulated load, outage, and edge cases
(ACH returns, 3DS failures, moderation queue spikes).\
• Holdouts & Experiments: Promotions, ranking, and any economic nudges
run with control cells and pre‑registered guardrails. We pause
experiments when guardrails breach.\
• Close‑the‑Loop: Post‑launch, we hold 7/30/90‑day reviews that tie
metrics to actions and retire ineffective steps.

Operational Disclaimer: This playbook bundle is an internal execution
guide. It is not a public policy document. Where compliance or legal
actions are required, consult Section 8 and counsel. Where money flows
change, consult Sections 3 and 4.

Context & Alignment: Our launch approach is city‑by‑city with nationwide
signups allowed, starting in Houston. We launch subscription‑free,
monetize through take‑rate and usage‑based promotions with strict
eligibility and caps, and keep public media within an artistic‑only
boundary with Safe‑Mode defaults for guests. Deliverables are handled
via external links (Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests. Instant
Book requires ID verification; background checks are opt‑in (Trusted
Pro). Payments include card (3DS when required) and ACH (with a reduced
buyer fee). Feature flags and city gates control blast radius, and the
Admin Console enables Support, Trust, Finance, and Ops to act without
code changes.

Goals:\
• Stand up a new city with sufficient verified supply and early demand
to avoid empty results.\
• Deploy time‑boxed perks and CPC floors matched to local liquidity
without rigging ranking.\
• Ship the same playbook predictably: verify, seed, promote, measure,
iterate.

Pre‑turn‑up (T‑30 → T‑7):\
□ Studio partners: 10--20 verified studios; deposit defaults configured;
house rules imported.\
□ Supply: 300+ ID‑verified providers across roles; 50 Trusted Pro;
balanced gender and specialties.\
□ Demand: 1,000+ waitlisted buyers; 50+ brand/agency leads; outreach
sequences prepped.\
□ Pricing floors: local CPC floors for promotions set; featured carousel
plan.\
□ Help content: city‑specific FAQs; local safety resources; studio
access details.

Turn‑up week (T‑7 → T):\
□ Press/PR drop; city landing page live with featured creators/studios.\
□ Founding city perks activated: 0% buyer fee first booking; --2%
provider fee for 60 days.\
□ Referral program switch‑on; invite codes distributed to partner
studios.\
□ Trust staffing extended for local hours; support macros localized.

Post‑turn‑up (T → T+30):\
□ Daily stand‑up with city metrics; tune CPC floors; adjust caps; rotate
Featured slots.\
□ Host creator meetup; collect content for home carousels; capture
testimonials.\
□ Activate RFP broadcast for brands; monitor response quality; adjust
threshold for eligibility.

Owners & Roles:\
• City GM --- owns overall success, partners, PR.\
• Growth lead --- owns perks, floors, featured slots.\
• Trust lead --- owns moderation and safety SLAs in city hours.\
• Support lead --- owns macro correctness and queue staffing.\
• Studios PM --- owns deposit & rules configuration.

Instrumentation & Readiness Signals:\
• City‑level S→I, I→B, GMV, active providers/buyers; promotions adoption
& ROAS; studio attach rate.\
• Supply heatmap: coverage by neighborhood; search \'no results\' rate;
bounce rate for first‑time visitors.

Top Risks & Mitigations:\
• Thin supply pockets → targeted invites; perks for under‑represented
niches; flexible radius defaults.\
• PR blowback on nudity policy → artistic‑only examples page; Safe‑Mode
defaults; trained press responses.

Acceptance Criteria (Go/No‑Go):\
✓ Sufficient supply (≥300 ID‑verified) and demand (≥1,000 waitlist) in
place.\
