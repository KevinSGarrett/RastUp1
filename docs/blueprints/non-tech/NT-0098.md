form.

Selects --- buyer picks which proofs should be finalized (if package
includes selection).

Finals --- fullspec outputs referenced via external links
(Drive/Dropbox/OneDrive/S3) + optional onplatform proxy; license applies
on acceptance.

UGC/Promo --- a verified post on IG/YT/TT/X with link and API check +
required minlive window.

Storagesane principle: We host previews/proxies only; originals stay at
the source. We capture a manifest and verify integrity (hash), so
disputes can be adjudicated without hosting 100GB+ assets.

C\) Typical Workflow

Prepare & Upload Proofs (seller)

Create a Delivery batch → add Proofs (images/videos) with auto
watermark/proxy.

Add External Links (optional) for previewing higher quality; platform
immediately stores manifest metadata (name, ext, size, checksum,
provider, URL).

Autochecks (see §F) run and annotate items.

Buyer Reviews Proofs

Grid/lightbox with zoom; peritem comments (and timecode comments for
video).

Buyer Selects up to the package count (e.g., 12 edits).

If package includes no selection step (e.g., "deliver all 20"), skip to
Finals.

Publish Finals (seller)

For each selected item (or the whole set), upload Final proxies and
attach External Links to originals.

Mark items Final; system locks proof download (if enabled) and exposes
Final download links.

Add License terms chip (pulled from package preset) and Usage window if
applicable.

Acceptance Window starts

Default 7 days (configurable per package: 3/7/14 days).

Buyer can Accept all or specific items, or Request revision (counts
toward package revision rounds).

Autoaccept triggers when the window expires with no action.

UGC/Promo: acceptance occurs when post verifies (API or link) and
remains live for the minlive window (e.g., 72h) --- see §E.

Closeout

On Acceptance/Autoaccept, talent booking moves to Completed; payout
queues per §1.3/§3.1.

Leave a review prompt for both sides.

D\) Roles & Deliverable Types (what's supported v1)

Photographer / Videographer: proofs → selects (optional) → finals;
peritem comments, timecoded notes; revision rounds per package.

Model (as seller): usually no file delivery; deliverables are
Time/Service + signed Model Release (already in Smart Docs). Optional:
selfie IDmatch (phase 2).

UGC Creator / FanSubscription Creator (promo work): Post verification
deliverables:

Link to post + screenshot on publish; platform fetches post ID,
timestamp, initial metrics (where APIs allow).

System tracks minlive (e.g., 72h) + post window (e.g., 7 days).

Acceptance after minlive + verification (see §E).

Studio: no deliverables; checkin/out + docs + deposit flows instead.

E\) UGC/Promo Verification (Creators & FanSub Creators)

At delivery: seller submits link to the post (IG/YT/TT/X) + optional
screenshot.

Verification check (hourly during window):

Confirms post exists, is public, matches handle, and the timestamp ≥
booking delivery time.

Logs engagement metrics snapshot (ER proxy) where APIs permit (or
displays "unverified metrics" for linkonly).

Minlive enforcement: track continuous visibility for N hours (package
default 72h; configurable per deliverable).

Acceptance rule: autoaccept on passing verification + minlive, or manual
accept earlier by buyer.

Edge cases: post removed/hidden before minlive → seller can repost once
without restarting the entire acceptance window; noncompliance → buyer
may open refund request (policy per §3.9).

Safe Mode note: We neither fetch nor display 18+ media; SFW thumbnails
only; for FanSub Creators we record confirmation and metrics sans
explicit previews.

F\) AutoChecks & Evidence (objective validation)

On upload or link attach:

Technical:

Images: resolution (≥ target px), color space (sRGB/Adobe RGB), aspect
ratio, file type, filesize, EXIF presence.

Video: container/codec (MP4/H.264 or ProRes proxy), resolution, fps,
audio channels, duration.

Integrity: virus scan; checksum recorded (SHA256) for proofs/finals (and
for external manifes
