hows the dataset table/view powering it; "Open in
warehouse" (readonly for Analysts).

M\) Metrics & Quality Ops

Data QA dashboard: event drop rates, late arrivals, schema errors,
backfill status.

Reconciliation: GMV per dashboard vs finance exports; discrepancy tile
with thresholds.

Ownership: each dashboard has an owner and oncall rotation for data
quality.

N\) Telemetry (Data UI)

data.dashboard.view (name) • data.tile.click (metric_key)

data.filter.apply • data.export.run (scope, rows) •
data.schedule.create/run/fail

data.alert.fire/ack/resolve (rule_id)

data.metric.version.change (key, old→new)

data.drilldown.open (entity_type) • data.deep_link.out

O\) Acceptance Criteria (mark 4.14.12 FINAL)

Metric Catalog exists; every tile references a catalog key+version with
definition tooltip.

Freshness badges, backfill banners, and data quality checks present on
all dashboards.

Curated dashboards for Marketplace, City Ops, Growth, Search &
Conversion, Promotions, T&S, Moderation, Support, Finance, Tax, Studios,
Experiments.

Filters/segments/cohorts work globally; cohort retention and funnel
views implemented.

Drilldowns to entities/cases; deep links into admin tools.

Exports (CSV/JSON/parquet) and scheduled reports (email/Slack) with RBAC
& masking.

Alerts and anomaly rules configurable; fire to Slack/email with
dashboard links.

PII/SafeMode protections: masking, aggregation thresholds, SFW previews,
watermarking.

LBG vs leg toggle implemented; labeled KPIs and exports.

Telemetry events and data QA dashboards live; owner per dashboard
assigned.

P\) Why this works

Puts the right numbers in front of each team with shared definitions, so
decisions are aligned.

Nearrealtime ops plus monthend depth covers both daily steering and
financial truth.

Privacysafe and actionlinked (deep links) means insights turn into
changes quickly.

Versioned metrics keep trust high even as we refine logic.

§4.14.13 --- Observability & Incident Response

Goal: Detect issues early, respond fast, and recover safely---without
exposing PII or requiring code changes. Provide a unified status
cockpit, clear SLOs/alerts, oneclick degradations/kill switches, tested
runbooks, disciplined postmortems, and links into every admin tool that
matters.

A\) Scope, Roles & Guardrails

Who uses this: OnCall (Product/Platform), SRE/Ops, City Ops (read),
Support Leads, Trust & Safety Leads, Finance (payout incidents), Legal
(for P0 comms approvals).\
What it covers: service health, dependency health, synthetic checks,
error budgets, alerts & paging, incident command, comms,
degradations/killswitches (from §4.14.2), runbooks, postmortems, and
status page publishing.

Guardrails:

Paging thresholds & killswitches are configdriven (see §4.14.2) with
twoperson approval for money/safety toggles.

PIIsafe logs only; sensitive views still respect §4.14.1 scopes.

B\) SLOs, SLIs & Error Budgets

Toplevel SLOs (Prod, monthly):

Checkout success (card/ACH): ≥ 99.5% 2xx within p95 latency ≤ 2.5s.

Booking create/accept: ≥ 99.7% success, p95 ≤ 1.5s.

Search: p95 ≤ 800ms, 99.9% availability.

Payout queue: ≥ 99% of eligible payouts queued within 2h of completion;
failure rate \< 0.5%.

Uploads & moderation pipeline: 99% of images/videos scanned within 60s;
backlog \< 2k items.

Tax calc: p95 ≤ 1.5s; exception rate \< 0.5%.

Promotions delivery: spend pacing error \< 5% daily; invalid click
falsenegative rate \< 2%.

SLIs monitored: success rate, latency p50/p95/p99, saturation (queue
depth, CPU/mem), dependency errors, synthetic check pass rate, error
budget burn (1h/6h/24h).

C\) Health Cockpit (Admin → Observability)

Status board tiles: API, Search, Checkout (Card/ACH), Escrow, Payouts,
Promotions, Uploads/Moderation, Tax Engine, Background Check, Studio
Deposits, Messaging, Notifications.\
Each tile shows current SLI/SLO, trend sparkline, errorbudget burn, and
degrade/kill buttons (where safe).\
Dependency pane: external provider status ingest; shows current
inc
