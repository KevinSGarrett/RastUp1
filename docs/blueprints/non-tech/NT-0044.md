guage: use "FanSubscription Creator" / "Premium Content
Creator" rather than platform brand names in paid ads (reduces adpolicy
risk).

Partner channel: outreach to reputable agencies managing fansubscription
creators; offer Founding Creator perks (reduced buyer fee on first
collaboration, free ID verify).

Proof: case studies highlighting SFW collab shoots + verified promo
deliverables (no explicit media).

Addendum A §2 GotoMarket: Studios Launch Scope & Emphasis
(ResearchUpdated)

Goal: Decide how (or if) "Studios" appears at launch without diluting
focus or overcompeting with Peerspace. Preserve our core: talent
discovery & bookings. Use studios as a complementary, lowfriction addon
that increases conversion for shoots---not a coequal vertical on day
one.

A\) Launch Positioning (what "Studios" means at MVP)

Name & framing: "Verified Studios (Lite)" --- curated creative spaces
and private studios suitable for photo/video shoots (not
events/parties).

Role in v1: Complementary to talent bookings. Studios appear as an
attachable option during briefs/checkout and as a subhub under Browse,
not a topnav pillar.

Geographic scope: Founding city only (e.g., Houston), seed 15--30
quality studios max; expand after PMF signals.

B\) Why not a full "Peerspace competitor" at launch

Focus & liquidity: Early marketplaces win by narrowing scope. A full
venue marketplace doubles complexity (supply ops, insurance, deposits,
map/amenity search, etc.).

Differentiation: Our edge is talent + tools (briefs, deliverables,
social metrics). Studios should amplify those flows (shoot readiness),
not become the main show.

Quality \> quantity: A curated set of creativeready spaces beats a thin
longtail that invites comparison to mature incumbents.

C\) What ships for Studios at MVP (scope you can build to)

Surface & discovery

Attach a Studio step in Brief and Checkout (city & date prefilled,
filter by distance/price/amenities).

Browse ▸ Verified Studios (Lite) subhub (not topnav): grid + map,
creative filters (natural light, cyc wall, blackout, ceilings, rates,
capacity).

Studio chips on talent profiles ("Has studio access" or "Owns studio")
when applicable.

Booking model

Instant Book default (host can opt "approval required"). Hourly
pricing + min hours; overtime rules.

Escrow same as talent; damage deposit (card hold) optional per host;
cleaning fee allowed; rules & access shown before pay.

Checkin/out with geofence & door code field; QR access optional later.

Verification (Lite)

Studio Lite (already designed in §3.4): doc OCR + geocode/Place match;
manual exception only.

Required docs: property/space release template + house rules
(autoattached via Smart Docs).

Payments & fees

Same 12% provider / 5% buyer baseline (see §3.1), deposit holds not
counted as GMV.

Refund matrix follows space norms (stricter latecancel terms than
talent; see matrix below).

D\) What we defer (postPMF)

Insurance marketplace, security deposits with offline inspections,
complex tiered amenities pricing, multilisting host dashboards, full
multicity inventory, eventuse cases.

Mapheavy discovery bells/whistles (streetlevel 3D tours, AR
walkthroughs).

Equipment rentals marketplace (separate future track).

E\) Studio Refund & Policy Matrix (v1 defaults; hosts may choose
stricter within bands)

Amenity overages (overtime/crew size): host may file PostBooking
Adjustments within 24h with evidence; buyer has 48h to approve/dispute.

F\) Marketplace Mechanics (how studios add conversion, not complexity)

Brief uplift: when buyer composes a shoot brief, Attach a Studio offers
3 nearby matches with "creative amenities" chips; increases award rate
by reducing buyer friction.

Talent crosssell: photographers who own a studio can toggle Studio AddOn
(hourly) inside their package; the system then exposes that studio at
checkout.

Boards: saved boards can include both talent & studios; Compare view
keeps them separated by type.
