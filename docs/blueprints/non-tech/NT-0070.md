D\) Dispute Process (structured & fast)

Open from "Get help" → choose reason.

Collect evidence: system preattaches manifest, autochecks, checkin/out,
chat. Parties add statements & files.

Cure window: provider gets 48h for technical shortfalls; buyer gets 24h
to supply missing info (e.g., link URLs).

Neutral Review (if unresolved): trained specialists compare against
Smart Docs & manifest; may request targeted files only (no fishing).

Decision: prorata refunds, reedit orders, or uphold delivery.

Payouts adjust automatically; receipts reissued.

Appeal (facts or policy error only): ≤ 5 business days SLA.

dispute with their bank; surface evidence inapp.

acceptance logs, checkin/out, comms timeline.

Fees: platform absorbs processor dispute fees unless clear abuse →
losing party may be charged a small dispute handling fee (see §3.1).

Risk dials: newprovider reserve; rolling reserves for highrisk cohorts;
Early Payout eligibility aligns with Rep ≥ 85 (see §3.2/§3.1).

Thresholds: keep chargeback ratio \<0.8%; above that → cohort risk
review; instant IB disable for outliers.
