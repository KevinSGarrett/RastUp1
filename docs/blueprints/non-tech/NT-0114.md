All flows keyboardable; large tap targets on mobile capture; clear alt
text for instructions.

Use progress steppers, skeleton loaders; show typical decision times
(e.g., "Most ID checks \< 2 min") as informative copy.

Support lowbandwidth: allow photo upload from gallery if live capture
fails.

N\) Acceptance Criteria (mark 4.13 FINAL)

Verification Center hub live at /verify, showing progress bars,
benefits, and next steps by type.

ID Verification: document + selfie liveness, instant decision or 24h
manual review; 18+ enforced; alias support; privacy copy present.

Background Check (Trusted Pro): consented, FCRAstyle notices,
clear/review/consider outcomes, preadverse/adverse workflow with 7day
window; annual recheck; fee surfaced; subsidies supported.

Social Verification: OAuth for IG/YT/TT/X, nightly sync + manual refresh
(3/day), verified chips in search/profile, safemode handling for FanSub
creators.

Studio Verification: ownership proof, address validation, photo
evidence, rules; badge on approval; reverify cadence; partial address
privacy.

Gating & incentives wired: Instant Book requires ID Verified; Boost
eligibility requires Trusted Pro + Rep ≥ 70; storage bumps (30 GB /
50 GB); DM credit increases; fee nudge --0.5% for Trusted Pro.

Admin console with queue, actions, audits, sanctions, and risk flags;
immutable logs.

Privacy & retention: PII minimization, encryption at rest, retention
windows, downloadmydata.

Notifications and nudge campaigns implemented; Accessibility/Performance
baselines met; Telemetry events firing.

O\) Why this works

Low friction, high signal: Users see exactly why to verify and what they
get---conversiondriving perks rather than busywork.

Safety you can feel: Clear standards, FCRAstyle fairness, and
privacybydesign build trust with models/creators and buyers.

Search quality improves: Verified supply rises to the top without
"paytowin"; risk is filtered before bookings.

Operates at scale: Vendorbacked checks, admin SLAs, audits, and recheck
cadence keep trust programs healthy citybycity.

§4.14.1 --- Access Governance & Security

Goal: Ensure admins can do their jobs safely, quickly, and accountably.
Enforce leastprivilege, protect PII, require explicit justification for
sensitive actions, and make every change auditable and alertable.

A\) Principles

Least privilege by default --- roles get only what they need.

PII is special --- tax/identity data behind extra gates; mask by
default.

Justintime elevation --- timeboxed, reasoned elevation for highrisk
actions.

Twoperson rule --- critical money/safety moves require a second
approver.

Full traceability --- immutable audit for who/what/why/when, with diffs.

Separation of duties --- no single role can initiate and approve the
same highrisk change.

Environment clarity --- bright "Sandbox/Prod" labeling; no
crosscontamination.

B\) Roles & Permission Scopes (RBAC)

Roles (no nesting; combine if needed):

Super Admin (restricted to founders/CTO): feature flags, configs,
emergency kills.

Trust & Safety: verifications, sanctions, strikes, IB toggle, content
quarantine.

Support: tickets/disputes, policybound refunds (within caps), message
redaction.

Finance: payouts/reserves, manual adjustments (with twoperson approval),
chargebacks, coupons.

Tax & Compliance: W9/TIN dashboard, 1099 runs, nexus map overrides
(dualapproval).

Content: reviews/profile/feed moderation, keyword lists, SafeMode
thresholds (preview only).

Ops (City/Market): promos, CPC floors, Featured slots, foundingcity
perks.

Marketing: homepage modules, email templates
