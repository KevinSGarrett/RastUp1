hedules. Revenue:
subscription or perengagement fee.

D. Collab Mode (for highhigh, noncash)

Zerocash collaboration contracts with deliverables (shoot + crossposting
obligations). Both sides sign; platform tracks performance (proofofpost,
content delivered).

We monetize via Pro plan features, not commission, and still accrue
reviews + reliability metrics.

E. AudienceFit Match

For creators/models: filter/score by audience geos and engagement (e.g.,
"US female 18--24 heavy") so buyers pay for reach that matters.

Existing platforms make you post castings or DM endlessly; Swipecast
leans into job posts with live chat. We avoid public job boards and keep
1to1 booking, plus powerful smart invites and autoaccept to remove the
manual grind.

8\) Boards (Favorites) for Real Projects

Save role cards into project boards, add notes (budget, fit, priority).

Bulk actions: Invite all, Request availability, Compare (rates, social
reach, reliability).

Share board as private link to collaborators (internal/agency use).

9\) NSFW & OnlyFans Policy --- Decision Framework & Recommendation

Reality: payment processors (Stripe/PayPal) restrict adult content;
explicit sexual content risks account shutdowns.

Options

Mainstreamfirst (Recommended)

Allow SFW + artistic nudity (nonexplicit) with NSFW gating and age/ID
verification; disallow explicit sexual content onplatform.

Allow OnlyFans creators as users; portfolios must follow our content
rules. They can link to OF externally; we don't ingest OF metrics (no
official API).

Use mainstream processors (easier scaling & brandsafe).

Adultfriendly lane (complex)

Permit explicit content in a segregated, agegated area; requires
adultfriendly payment processors and heavy compliance (age checks,
recordkeeping). High ops/compliance cost; potential ad restrictions.

Recommendation: Option 1 for launch. Capture the boudoir/glamour
business and OF creators (as creators) without explicit content on the
site. Revisit a dedicated adult lane only after strong traction and
compliance capability.

10\) SingleCompose Feed (No Double Posting), Smart Delivery

User posts once, tags one or more roles (Model/Photog/etc.).

Delivery:

Followers choose role preferences when following a user; the feed shows
posts matching their interests first.

Dedupe: if a post is multitagged, we only show it once to the follower.

Profile Posts tab defaults to the role you're viewing; toggle "All
roles".

Templates: Availability update, Portfolio drop, BTS, Looking to collab
(private invite CTA, not public job).

Optional: crosspost to connected socials (later).

This keeps posting simple for multirole users while giving followers
clean, relevant feeds.

11\) Extra Verifications (low cost, high trust)

Baseline (free): email + phone/SMS; 2FA optional.

ID & Age (paid): document + selfie liveness via IDV provider (e.g.,
Persona/Onfido). Typical SMB pricing starts around \$250/mo platform
minimums or percheck fees; we can pass costs to users wanting the badge.

Background Check (paid, optional "Trusted Pro"): US checks via vendor
(e.g., Checkr packages \~\$30--\$90/report). We pass through + small
margin; renewal annually.

SocialVerified (free): connect IG/TikTok/YT for verified metrics badge
(see §5).

PaymentVerified (free): valid card/bank on file.

StudioVerified (optional): onetime address + utility/biz doc for studio
listings.

ReferenceVerified (free): after N completed bookings with \>4★ average,
earn "Great Partner" ribbon (automated).

Incentives: Each badge improves search boost and DM credits (as we set
in §1.1), so verification increases bookings and offsets its cost.

12\) Pricing Impact of Verifications

We do not absorb expensive checks at scale; instead:

Passthrough direct costs (IDV/background) with small margin.

Bundle into Pro subscription (includes 1 ID check + search boost +
analytics Pro).

Net effect: verifications pay for themselves via higher ranking, more
DMs, Instant Book eligibility, and higher con
