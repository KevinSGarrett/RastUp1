ctivation rate (how many
of those sign-ups become active customers), and growth rate
week-over-week in the early months.

Supply-side metrics: number of service providers/partners onboarded,
their activity levels, and the supply-demand ratio (e.g. are there
enough drivers to fulfill ride requests within target wait times).

Engagement and retention: repeat usage rates, cohort retention of
customers after launch, and customer satisfaction/NPS scores in the new
city.

Unit economics: particularly LTV/CAC (Customer Lifetime Value vs.
Customer Acquisition Cost) in each city. We will track how this ratio
evolves as the city matures -- initially it may be below 1 (as we invest
in growth), but our goal is to drive it above 1 (customers become
profitable) within a defined period. Achieving a healthy LTV/CAC is a
key signal that a city can move from launch phase to growth phase.

These metrics will be reviewed frequently (weekly during the initial
launch period, then monthly as the market stabilizes). If a city is
falling behind on any KPIs, the launch team and central team will
collaborate to diagnose issues and implement fixes. Because we
anticipate variance between cities, we won't rigidly stick to an
expansion plan without adapting. As Instacart's Boston General Manager
noted regarding expansion playbooks: a playbook is extremely useful as a
starting point, but every city is so unique that one must know when to
follow the recipe and when to trust one's taste buds. In that spirit,
our team will constantly question assumptions and adjust our tactics to
local realities. Regular cross-city meetings will be held to share
lessons learned; what we learn in City A's launch will refine how we
approach City B, and so on.

We will maintain a "living" city launch playbook document that is
updated continuously. This is not a static manual, but a collection of
best practices, checklists, and learnings that the launch team can
reference and contribute to. For instance, if a particular marketing
channel (say, college campus outreach) proved highly effective in one
city, we'll note that in the playbook and consider employing it in
similar markets. Conversely, if we discover that a strategy didn't work
in a city, we'll document the context and caution for the future. The
goal is to make each subsequent launch more efficient and successful by
leveraging accumulated knowledge. As one founder described, their
playbook started as lessons from their first market and was "refined
with each city launch\... giving a solid starting point when entering
new markets". Our approach mirrors this philosophy of continuous
improvement.

Finally, success will also be measured at the macro level -- how our
multi-city expansion contributes to the company's overall growth and
market leadership. We expect that by following this GTM and city launch
plan, we will rapidly grow our user base and revenue. The ultimate
validation will be achieving dominant position in key markets. Companies
that executed disciplined expansion strategies have not only scaled to
hundreds of cities but often emerged as the category leaders in every
region they entered. We have the same ambition. By closely tracking our
metrics and iterating on our strategy, we'll ensure that our expansion
is not just rapid, but also sustainable and strategically sound, paving
the way for long-term success.
