tion increases bookings and offsets its cost.

12\) Pricing Impact of Verifications

We do not absorb expensive checks at scale; instead:

Passthrough direct costs (IDV/background) with small margin.

Bundle into Pro subscription (includes 1 ID check + search boost +
analytics Pro).

Net effect: verifications pay for themselves via higher ranking, more
DMs, Instant Book eligibility, and higher conversion. (We'll track
uplift in Analytics, §13.)

13\) ProviderSide Analytics (RightSized)

Core (free)

Views → Messages → Bookings funnel (per role)

Search queries & top filters that surfaced you (e.g., "5′8″+ fitness
models in Houston")

Avg position in search for your key filters (est.)

Package performance (acceptance, upsell to extras)

Reliability metrics (response time, cancellation rate)

Social snippet if connected: followers, engagement trend (30d)

Pro (paid)

Audience analytics (for creators): geo/age/gender summaries from APIs

Benchmarking: your rates/turnaround vs. local peers (by role & rating)

Price optimizer suggestions (raise/drop by X% based on conversion)

Boarding intelligence: who saved you to boards; abandoned invite
recovery prompts

ROI calculators (e.g., cost per 1k engaged audience for creators/models)

We'll use public platform benchmarks to contextualize engagement
expectations (e.g., TikTok engagement averages).

14\) Acceptance Criteria (for this section)

Rolefirst search with rolespecific filters deployed.

SocialVerified users show live metrics and can be filtered by
followers/engagement/audience (platform permitting).

Packages + Extras required for checkout across roles.

Instant Book, Smart Invites, and Autoaccept rules working (nonpublic,
not a job board).

NSFW policy implemented per recommendation (artistic nudity only;
explicit disallowed; NSFW gating + 18+ checks).

Singlecompose, multitag feed with follower role preferences and dedupe.

Verification badges confer search boost + DM credits; paid checks
passthrough costs.

Core Analytics panel live; Pro Analytics gated behind subscription.

15\) Competitive Notes (Why this wins)

ModelMayhem/PurplePort: filters exist for appearance but lack
availability, reliability, and true audience metrics; UX is dated and
often forum/casting dependent. We modernize with ecommerce booking,
reputation signals, and socialverified discovery.

Swipecast: strong on job posts & payments, but our smart invites +
instant book + verified social metrics deliver faster 1to1 bookings and
eliminate the "manual casting call" drag.

Quick Answers to Your Specific Points

"Live display of social metrics & searchable?" Yes, for connected
Instagram Creator/Business, YouTube, and TikTok (within respective
APIs/permissions). OF has no official public API---so no live OF search.

"Don't show gear/software for photographers." Done---our filters focus
on style, deliverables, turnaround, rate, reliability, studio access.

"No TFP in search; make it like Airbnb/Fiverr." Agreed---Packages +
Extras with instant book/escrow = frictionless paid bookings. We support
Collab Mode separately for highhigh noncash pairings (keeps brand clean
& still builds reputation).

"NSFW & OnlyFans?" Launch mainstreamfirst (allow artistic nudity with
gating, no explicit content). Allow OF creators on the platform but
don't ingest OF metrics. This keeps payments simple
(Stripe/PayPalcompatible) and brandsafe.

"One post or multiple per role?" One post with role tags; followers see
only what they opted into; profile posts default to the active role tab.

"More verifications?" Added SocialVerified, PaymentVerified,
StudioVerified, ReferenceVerified---lowcost, hightrust. Paid checks (ID,
Background) are passthrough with perks to offset cost.

"Analytics size?" Start with Core (funnel, search terms, package
performance), then upsell Pro (benchmarks, audience analytics, price
optimizer).
