B4. Joins & Common Queries

Examples: profile discovery funnel; promotions ROAS; dispute loss rate;
payout latency by role. Include sample SQL patterns and caution about
double counting.

B5. Freshness & Quality SLOs

Gold tables freshness ≤ 15 min for events, ≤ 24h for aggregates. Data
quality gates: completeness, uniqueness, referential integrity.

B6. Ownership & Change Control

Owners: Data team. Schema changes require RFC; version notes; downstream
impact analysis.

Implementation Notes:\
• Keep this appendix version‑controlled; link to the controlling owner
and next review date.\
• Align terminology with Section 1 UI labels and Section 5 metrics
catalog; avoid synonyms that confuse staff.\
• When examples include numbers, ensure they reconcile to Section 3.1
fee math and Section 4.12 receipts.\
• Accessibility: all templates should be usable with keyboard‑only
navigation and screen readers.\
• Privacy: avoid embedding real PII in examples; use placeholders
consistently.\
• City‑gates: where content varies by city, call out the delta
explicitly and tie to the corresponding feature flag.\
• Training: every appendix should have a 1‑page executive summary and a
\'how to use this\' section for Support/Trust.\
• Change control: every material change requires an entry in the
changelog, owner sign‑off, and a Slack announcement to the relevant
channel.
