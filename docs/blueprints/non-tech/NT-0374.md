etion records.

Owners & Roles:\
• Support lead --- macros, staffing, training.\
• Trust liaison --- safety escalations and training.\
• Finance liaison --- money macros and approvals.\
• Product --- admin feature readiness and gaps.

Instrumentation & Readiness Signals:\
• FRT/FRR; reopen rate; macro usage rate; CSAT; SLA breaches; ticket
categories and trends.\
• Deflection: % resolved via knowledge base before ticket creation.

Top Risks & Mitigations:\
• Under‑tooled support → backlog and inconsistent outcomes; mitigate
with calculators and macros.\
• Over‑escalation → engineer toil; mitigate with clear paths and admin
powers.

Acceptance Criteria (Go/No‑Go):\
✓ Macros published and versioned; refund calculator validated with
finance; training complete.\
✓ SLAs met during dry run; escalation and paging tested; knowledge base
\>90% coverage of top issues.

Scenario Playbook --- Refund volume spike:\
Trigger: Refund tickets \> baseline × 2\
Response: Enable queue filters; adjust macros; preemptive emails for
known issues; expand staffing windows.\
Roll‑back/Forward: Return to standard macros; retrospective root cause
analysis.\
Owner: Support lead \| Telemetry: refund_ticket_rate, SLA_breaches \|
User Copy: "We've received your refund request and are prioritizing it.
Expect an update soon."

Scenario Playbook --- Spam wave in DMs:\
Trigger: New‑conversation sends with low response rate spike\
Response: Tighten rate limits; require IDV for new outreach; update
abuse heuristics; temporary DM credit freeze.\
Roll‑back/Forward: Gradual relaxation with monitors.\
Owner: Trust liaison \| Telemetry: dm_send_rate, spam_reports \| User
Copy: "We're limiting new messages briefly to reduce spam while
maintaining creator safety."

Implementation Notes:\
• Flags & City Gates: Every user‑visible change ships behind a flag with
a documented blast radius, an owner, and a rollback plan. City
allowlists prevent accidental national exposure. Admin has kill‑switches
for money and safety features with two‑person approval.\
• Admin Operability: No checklist is \'done\' unless Support can resolve
the top 3 edge cases without engineering and Trust can perform required
actions with an audit trail.\
• Help‑Center Alignment: All user‑facing copy is mirrored in the help
center with last‑updated dates and visual examples. We avoid legal
jargon; we explain outcomes and next steps.\
• QA Strategy: We prefer production‑like staging with seeded data and
synthetic bookings. We test under simulated load, outage, and edge cases
(ACH returns, 3DS failures, moderation queue spikes).\
• Holdouts & Experiments: Promotions, ranking, and any economic nudges
run with control cells and pre‑registered guardrails. We pause
experiments when guardrails breach.\
• Close‑the‑Loop: Post‑launch, we hold 7/30/90‑day reviews that tie
metrics to actions and retire ineffective steps.
