oved, variance vs preview (target \< 1%).

Index jobs: doc rebuild throughput, search latency impact.

Comms: open/click/complaint rate on notices.

Safety: user reports spike postjob (guardrail metric).

P\) Acceptance Criteria (mark 4.14.14 FINAL)

Unified Bulk Job wizard with filters, dryrun, approvals, schedule,
monitoring, rollback templates.

User merge with LinkandHold → Finalize;
payout/W9/TIN/payout/portfolio/reviews/DMs/boards consolidation;
redirects set; audit logged.

LBG tools: link/unlink legs, acceptance/delivery date shifts, addenda
attach + reaccept flow.

Money jobs: refunds/credits/fee fixes with caps, recomputed fees/taxes,
amended receipts, Finance ledger posts.

Promotions jobs: pause/resume, floor alignment, budget/date edits,
invalidclick makegoods.

Index & metrics jobs: reindex, Rep recalc, social resync, NSFW
rescan---throttled & resumable.

Boards/content: move/merge boards, retag collaborators, reprivacy
content with appeals links.

Studio policy updates: deposit %, caps, cleaning/min duration with
addenda options; no silent increases on existing bookings.

Scheduling/chunking/idempotency and PIIsafe previews; detailed job logs
& snapshots.

Metrics/alerts/telemetry for success, deltas, errors, and performance
impact.

Q\) Why this works

Ops speed, safely: Big changes happen during offpeak with previews,
caps, and approvals.

Reversible where possible: snapshots and rollback templates reduce fear
and downtime.

Money and policyaware: recomputes fees/taxes, issues amended receipts,
triggers addenda and reacceptance where users must opt in.

Scales with growth: chunked, resumable, idempotent jobs keep risk low as
data volume rises.

§4.14.15 --- Legal & Records

Goal: Handle subpoenas/LE requests, litigation holds, datasubject
actions, and retention/deletion safely and defensibly---with
leastprivilege access, full audit trails, reliable exports, and clear
coordination with Trust/Safety, Support, and Finance. Keep engineers out
of the loop for routine matters; make exceptional cases twoperson
approved and PIIsafe.

A\) Scope, Roles & Guardrails

Who uses this: Legal (owner), Privacy/Compliance, Trust & Safety Leads
(read/assist), Support Leads (DSR assist), Finance/Tax (view for
records), Readonly Auditor.

What it covers:

Intake & verification of subpoenas, warrants, and LE requests (USonly).

Case vaults and legal holds that suspend deletion/retention timers.

Data retention schedules & purge jobs for system records (chat,
bookings, docs, logs).

Data Subject Requests (DSR): access/export, deletion (where allowed),
and optout logging.

Clickwrap & consent logs (ToS/Privacy, Edelivery).

Discovery exports: review sets with PII redaction and hashed manifests.

Guardrails:

Twoperson approval for any data disclosure or hold release (Legal +
Privacy).

PII scopes enforced (see §4.14.1): only Legal role can unmask PIITax and
PIIBackground inside exports.

Chainofcustody hashing on every produced file.

Gag order awareness: suppress user notifications where order shown and
recorded.

B\) Intake & Triage (Subpoenas / LE Requests)

Intake form (upload + metadata): issuer, type (subpoena/warrant/court
order/civil), jurisdiction, case number, served date/time, compliance
deadline, scope (user(s), timeframe), gag order flag, contact info.\
Verification checklist: signature and court details, jurisdiction match
(US), acceptable service method.\
Routing: autoopen Legal case with SLA timers (e.g., acknowledge within 2
business days; faster for warrant
