Context & Alignment: Our launch approach is city‑by‑city with nationwide
signups allowed, starting in Houston. We launch subscription‑free,
monetize through take‑rate and usage‑based promotions with strict
eligibility and caps, and keep public media within an artistic‑only
boundary with Safe‑Mode defaults for guests. Deliverables are handled
via external links (Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests. Instant
Book requires ID verification; background checks are opt‑in (Trusted
Pro). Payments include card (3DS when required) and ACH (with a reduced
buyer fee). Feature flags and city gates control blast radius, and the
Admin Console enables Support, Trust, Finance, and Ops to act without
code changes.

Goals:\
• Turn launch learnings into process and product improvements quickly.\
• Hold owners accountable for outcomes with clear metrics and action
items.\
• Decide whether to expand to the next city based on evidence.

7‑Day Review:\
□ Adoption: active providers/buyers vs targets; first‑booking rates;
activation funnels.\
□ Trust: report rate; moderation SLA; IDV adoption; early safety
incidents.\
□ Money: checkout success; payout latency; daily close; tax
reconciliation.\
□ Support: FRT/FRR; top tickets; macro gaps.\
□ Promotions (if on): adoption; ROAS; invalid‑click credits.

30‑Day Review:\
□ Conversion: S→I and I→B trends; repeat bookings; cancellations and
reasons.\
□ Economics: take‑rate mix; processor costs; promotions contribution;
COGS vs plan.\
□ Quality: dispute loss rate; review sentiment; reputation score
distribution.\
□ Ops: staffing vs SLA; incident count; flag drift; help‑center
coverage.

90‑Day Review:\
□ Cohort retention curves; contribution margin; CAC payback in city;
referrals and organic loops.\
□ Safety stability; appeals accuracy; Trusted Pro share; studios attach
and deposit claims.\
□ Decision: scale promotions floors? Open nearby city? Adjust perks?

Owners & Roles:\
• City GM --- overall; compile review.\
• Product & Data --- KPIs and analysis.\
• Trust & Support --- safety and ops analysis.\
• Finance --- economics and close; tax reconciliation.\
• Growth --- promotions and CAC payback.

Instrumentation & Readiness Signals:\
• Dashboards per §5; appendix with definitions; DQ report; cohort
charts; incident summaries.

Top Risks & Mitigations:\
• Celebratory bias → insist on counter‑metrics; include \'what went
wrong\' section.\
• Action‑less reviews → require named owners and due dates for every
item.

Acceptance Criteria (Go/No‑Go):\
✓ Action plan approved with owners and deadlines for the next 30 days.\
✓ Decision recorded on city expansion or adjustments to
floors/perks/promotions.\
✓ Review doc archived with links to dashboards, audits, and incident
reports.

Scenario Playbook --- Dispute loss rate out of bounds:\
Trigger: Loss rate \> target for 2 months\
Response: Tighten SOW defaults; improve manifest guidance; enhance
chargeback kits; educate users with comms.\
Roll‑back/Forward: Re‑evaluate after 30 days; iterate solutions.\
Owner: Finance/Product \| Telemetry: dispute_loss_rate, refund_rate \|
User Copy: "We've clarified deliverables and refunds to reduce
misunderstandings."

Scenario Playbook --- Promotions ROAS under target:\
Trigger: ROAS median \< 2.5×\
Response: Adjust QS weights; lower density; improve provider guidance;
test floors; pause low‑quality cohorts.\
Roll‑back/Forward: Restore after lift.\
Owner: Growth \| Telemetry: ROAS_distribution, QS \| User Copy: "Tips to
improve your boost performance are now in your dashboard."

Implementation Notes:\
• Flags & City Gates: Every user‑visible change ships behind a flag with
a documented blast radius, an owner, and a rollback plan. City
allowlists prevent accidental national exposure. Admin has kill‑switches
for money and safety features with two‑person approval.\
• Admin Operability: No checklist is \'done\' unless Support can resolve
