his includes geo-targeted online ads (social media, search engines)
focused on the city's residents, and localized content on our website or
app store listings highlighting why our product/service is a great fit
for that city. We will also pursue local media coverage and PR
opportunities (press releases, local news features) to announce our
launch and explain the unique value we bring to the community.

Beyond digital channels, on-the-ground and community-focused marketing
will be key. We plan to engage in grassroots promotion such as
city-specific launch events, pop-up demos, or sponsorships. For example,
if launching a new service in a city, we might host a launch day event
or partner with a popular local festival to showcase our offering.
Forming partnerships with local businesses or influencers can greatly
accelerate word-of-mouth. One proven tactic is to go directly where our
target customers already congregate. For instance, when Oatly expanded
into a new market, they bypassed generic ads and partnered with local
coffee shops to reach their ideal customers at the point of purchase, a
strategy credited with helping their product gain rapid adoption (10x
revenue growth in one year). We will identify similar win-win
partnership opportunities in each city (whether it's coffee shops,
community centers, universities, or other venues relevant to our target
demographic) to embed our product into the local lifestyle from the
start.

Our customer acquisition playbook in each city will be experimental and
responsive to local feedback. Each city has a unique culture and what
works in one market may not work in another. To account for this, we
will be prepared to test and iterate on marketing channels quickly.
Early in the launch, the team will test a range of channels -- e.g.
social media campaigns, flyer distributions in high-traffic areas,
referral incentives, collaborations with local influencers -- and double
down on those that show traction. As one startup founder notes from
experience, it's important to "cycle through different customer
acquisition approaches because every new market is different", and to
spend time on the ground learning "what makes a city tick" by seeing
things from the local's perspective. In practice, this could mean our
team spends the first couple of weeks immersing in the city's daily
life, talking to potential users, and understanding their needs and
habits.

We will also deploy creative grassroots tactics to spark initial
word-of-mouth. For example, one company found success by physically
going to a local flea market right after launch and pitching their
product directly to shoppers who fit their target profile, essentially
bringing the product to the customer at a point of need. In our case,
we'll seek out comparable opportunities (whether it's attending meetups,
weekend markets, or neighborhood events) to personally introduce our
service to early adopters. Such high-touch efforts not only drive early
user sign-ups but also show the community that we are invested and
engaged locally.

All these marketing efforts will be coordinated to create a surge of
awareness and adoption around the launch period. We aim to achieve a
critical mass of users in the first weeks, which will attract further
users through network effects and social proof. By combining targeted
digital campaigns with on-the-ground engagement and partnerships, our
go-to-market strategy ensures that each city launch quickly gains
momentum and establishes our brand firmly in the local market.

2.4 Launch Timeline & Milestones

Executing a city launch will be done in phases with clear timelines and
milestones to keep the team on track. We will use a milestone-based city
launch plan that breaks the process into manageable stages from
pre-launch through post-launch. Below is an outline of the launch
timeline for each city:

Pre-Launch Preparation (T-minus 6 Weeks): Approximately six weeks before
the public launch, our advance team (especially
