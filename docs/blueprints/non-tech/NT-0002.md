ts + bonus credits for verified tiers. Bookings and reply threads
do not consume credits.

9\) Portfolio & Tagging (Per Role, Easy to Maintain)

Media Library (account level): upload once, then assign media to one or
more roles (checks).

Role Portfolios: Each SP has Albums (e.g., "Editorial", "Fitness").
Media show role tags and collaborator tags.

Tagging collaborators: Add other users to media with role credit (e.g.,
"@Sam --- Model").

Approval queue for the tagged user; on approve, the media appears in
their Collaboration section (rolespecific).

NSFW controls (if allowed): mark media NSFW; hidden by default unless
viewer opts in.

Maintenance speed: Assigning media to roles is a multiselect action.
Bulk actions to clone albums across roles.

10\) Follows & Favorites (Boards)

Follow (global, simple):

Follow the user account (not per role) to keep counts meaningful.

Feed preferences let a follower choose which roletagged posts they want
to see (All / Model / Photographer / ...).

Favorites ("Boards"):

Save either the role card ("Jane --- Model") or the user ("Jane --- All
Roles").

Boards can mix items but default to roleconsistent when saved from a
role search.

Create projectspecific boards (e.g., "Q2 Lookbook Models") with notes,
tags, and share/collab options (optional future).

Quick actions on cards: Compare, Bulk message, Request availability
(future).

11\) Posts & Feeds (RoleTagged, Unified View)

Users can post updates (text, image, video). Each post must be tagged
with one or more roles.

Profile Posts tab defaults to the role being viewed; toggle to "All
roles".

Global follower feed shows posts from accounts you follow; filter by
role tags.

Post types (examples): Portfolio release, BTS, Availability,
Lookingtocollab (but avoid "job board" styling), Deliverables showcase.

12\) Verification Badges & DM Credits (Incentives)

Badge tiers:

Email verified

Phone/SMS verified (+5 newconversation message credits/month)

ID verified (+10 credits, search boost)

Background checked ("Trusted Pro") (+∞ credits for new conversations,
top search tier)

Display: badges in header & on search cards.

Search boost rules: Verified profiles rank above unverified (within
relevance range). Backgroundchecked get an extra boost.

Rationale: Tangible perks make verification desirable beyond trust (more
DMs, higher visibility), aligning with your incentive idea.

13\) Admin & Safety Controls (RoleAware)

Role completeness gates: a Service Profile must meet a minimal
completeness score (mandatory fields + 6+ portfolio items) to appear in
search.

Moderation by role: media, posts, and reviews are flagged in context of
a role.

Dispute/Report always tied to a booking (and thus to a role), keeping
records clean.

14\) Analytics (User & Internal)

For users (per role and overall):

Views, saves to boards, messages started, booking requests, conversion
rate, avg. response time.

Content performance: portfolio item views, post engagement.

For ops (internal):

Liquidity by city/role, search→inquiry→booking funnel, verification
adoption, dispute rates by role.

15\) Edge Cases & UX Rules

Multirole appearing in one search: Show only the matching role card;
breadcrumb says "Also offers: X" (link to other SP page).

Switching roles on profile: Keep sticky tabs visible; switching tabs
changes CTA & fields seamlessly.

Adding a new role later: Onboarding wizard for that role (fields +
minimal portfolio) before activation.

Calendar conflicts: Booking on any role blocks the account calendar.
Attempting overlapping requests prompts a conflict resolution UI.

Reviews spillover: Do not mix ratings across roles in search ranking.
Display crossrole ratings in the header for transparency only.

16\) MVP vs. PhaseUp (for scope control)

MVP must haves:

Linked Service Profiles; rolefirst search; rolespecific fields &
portfolios; roleanchored bookings; rolespecific reviews; unified inbox
with role tags; basic follows; basic favorites boards; verific
