• When examples include numbers, ensure they reconcile to Section 3.1
fee math and Section 4.12 receipts.\
• Accessibility: all templates should be usable with keyboard‑only
navigation and screen readers.\
• Privacy: avoid embedding real PII in examples; use placeholders
consistently.\
• City‑gates: where content varies by city, call out the delta
explicitly and tie to the corresponding feature flag.\
• Training: every appendix should have a 1‑page executive summary and a
\'how to use this\' section for Support/Trust.\
• Change control: every material change requires an entry in the
changelog, owner sign‑off, and a Slack announcement to the relevant
channel.

Implementation Notes:\
• Keep this appendix version‑controlled; link to the controlling owner
and next review date.\
• Align terminology with Section 1 UI labels and Section 5 metrics

Appendix D --- City Scoring Model (Expansion Readiness)

Generated on 2025-11-04 23:53:44 UTC

Purpose\
Provide an objective method to evaluate new cities for expansion,
avoiding hype‑driven decisions. The model aligns with Section 2 GTM and
Section 12 roadmap gates. It produces a composite score with go/no‑go
recommendations, data sources, and staffing implications.

D1. Scoring Axes & Weights (Example)

• \*\*Supply Depth (30%)\*\* --- Active creators/providers per 10k
population; studio partners; education partners; social presence.

• \*\*Demand Potential (25%)\*\* --- Local ad spend proxies; SMB
density; DTC presence; content‑hungry verticals.

• \*\*Unit Economics (20%)\*\* --- CPC expectations; estimated take‑rate
GMV; tax complexity; payment costs.

• \*\*Operational Readiness (15%)\*\* --- Moderator/Support
availability; local studio partners; legal comfort.

• \*\*Competitive/PR (10%)\*\* --- Competitor presence; partnership
opportunities; press friendliness.

D2. Data Sources & Collection

Internal: waitlists, signups, search traffic, conversion in adjacent
cities. External: census data, business registries, ad spend proxies,
social trend indices.

D3. Score Calculation & Thresholds

Normalize each axis to 0--100; apply weights; composite score ≥ 70 →
consider Beta; 60--69 → nurture; \< 60 → defer. Add qualitative notes.

D4. Decision Packet Template

One‑pager with score, map, supply heatmap, top partners, risks,
staffing,
