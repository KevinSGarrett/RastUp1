Roadmap Disclaimer: This is an internal planning document. Dates are
placeholders and will firm up as Section 5 telemetry validates
conversion and quality gates. All items ship behind flags and city
allowlists. Nothing herein creates external commitments.

Context & Alignment: US‑only creative marketplace; subscription‑free at
launch; monetization via take‑rate and usage‑based promotions with
eligibility gates and strict caps; public content limited to
artistic‑only (guest Safe‑Mode on by default); deliverables handled via
external links (Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests; escrowed
payments released on acceptance; Instant Book gated by ID verification;
optional background checks confer Trusted Pro; city‑gated rollout with
feature flags; strong Admin Console with least‑privilege, JIT elevation,
two‑person approvals, and immutable audits.

Timeframe & Scope:\
• Updated quarterly; synchronized with Section 9 budgets and Section 10
launches.

Goals:\
• Align headcount and vendor spend with phase gates and city
expansions.\
• Ensure Support/Trust scaling keeps SLAs while avoiding over‑hiring.

Product Themes:\
• Lean, phased hiring; vendor consolidation; training and quality
guardrails.

Workstreams & Deliverables:\
• Squad plans per phase; hiring profiles; onboarding; training;
shadowing; QA sign‑off.\
• Vendor spend reviews; SLA scorecards; renewal calendar;
backups/failovers.\
• Support/Trust staffing models; surge plans; knowledge base and macro
maintenance cadence.

Feature Flags & City Gates:\
• ops.hiring.freeze (when needed), vendor.sla.alerts, support.surge.plan

Dependencies & Inputs:\
• Finance budgets (§9), GTM (§2), launches (§10), admin tooling (§4.14).

Top Risks & Mitigations:\
• Over‑hiring ahead of signals; vendor lock‑in; training gaps; burnout;
SLA misses.

Instrumentation & KPIs:\
• Runway months; burn multiple; SLA compliance; training completion;
macro freshness; vendor uptime vs SLA.

Acceptance Criteria (Go/No‑Go):\
✓ Hiring unlocks tied to KPIs; vendor SLAs green; support SLAs met with
buffers.

Staffing & Ownership:\
• Leadership, HR/Recruiting, Finance, City Ops, Support/Trust,
Engineering managers.

Milestones & Checkpoints:\
• Quarterly headcount review; vendor rationalization; training
refreshes; retention checks.

Implementation Notes:\
• Flag Discipline: Each capability ships behind a named flag with a
runbook, owner, rollback, and blast‑radius notes. Flags default to
\'off\' in new cities.\
• Admin Operability: No workstream is \'done\' until admin tools enable
Support/Trust/Finance to handle the top 3 edge cases without
engineering.\
• Copy & Policy: All flows have help‑center articles and email/SMS
templates; copy avoids legalese and links to policy examples.\
• QA & Drills: Staging mimics production data shapes; drills include
processor/tax outages, moderation surges, and incident command
handoffs.\
• Experimentation: Features that affect marketplace economics (ranking,
boosts, fees) include holdouts and guardrails; we measure incremental
impact.\
• Data Wiring: Events land in Bronze/Silver/Gold (§5); KPIs pull only
from Gold with freshness SLOs. Definitions live in a metrics catalog.\
• Accessibility: New UI complies with WCAG 2.1 AA; screen‑reader and
keyboard paths verified; contrast ratios checked; defects triaged.\
• Security & Privacy: PII masked by default; JIT elevation for sensitive
admin actions; vendor scopes minimal; audits immutable.\
• City Readiness: City‑first artifacts (press kit, creator ambassadors,
studio partners) prepared in §10.1 runbook.\
• Post‑Launch: 7/30/90‑day reviews convert observations into roadmap
changes; flags let us tune by city without forks.
