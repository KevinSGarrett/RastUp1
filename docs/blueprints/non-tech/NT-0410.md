Instrumentation & success metrics:\
• Harassment reports per 1,000 legs; appeal reversals; impersonation
takedowns; IDV adoption; safety incident rate.

Thresholds & triggers (Go/No‑Go, rollback, escalation):\
• Harassment ≥ threshold → enable stricter defaults; impersonation
cluster → require IDV for new DMs.

Dependencies & assumptions:\
• Section 8 policies; §4.14 admin moderation tools; §1.5 signals; §3.4
verification monetization.

Acceptance checklist (risk under control when):\
□ Calibrated examples live; moderation training complete; appeal SLAs
met; trusted contact & area‑share live.

Scenario Deep‑Dive --- Coordinated harassment campaign:\
Context: External group targets creators after media coverage.\
Trigger: Reports ×3 baseline; social mentions spike.\
Immediate actions: Enable stricter DM limits; block repeat abusive
accounts; comms with safety tips; liaise with PR/legal.\
Communication: Status page + help‑center; direct messages to affected
users.\
Rollback/Forward: Return to normal limits when stable; retrospective.\
Owner: Trust + Comms \| Telemetry: report_rate, block_rate \| Evidence:
Report logs; message excerpts (redacted)

Execution Notes:\
• Every risk has a dashboard tile with an owner, a definition of the
denominator, and a weekly narrative. • Risk reviews pair with §10
post‑launch 7/30/90‑day reviews and §8 compliance calendar. • Where a
risk spans multiple squads, the city GM or Risk DRI chairs the review;
actions have due dates. • We prefer reversible changes (flags) and
narrow blast radius (city gates). • We avoid \'security by obscurity\';
we publish clear user guidance, train staff, and keep audit trails for
all sensitive actions. • The risk register itself is versioned; changes
record rationale and observed metrics.
