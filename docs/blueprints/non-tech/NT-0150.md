 metadata): issuer, type (subpoena/warrant/court
order/civil), jurisdiction, case number, served date/time, compliance
deadline, scope (user(s), timeframe), gag order flag, contact info.\
Verification checklist: signature and court details, jurisdiction match
(US), acceptable service method.\
Routing: autoopen Legal case with SLA timers (e.g., acknowledge within 2
business days; faster for warrants).\
Scope precheck: search users/bookings to confirm identifiers; if
insufficient, send clarification template (via Smart Docs §4.14.10).

Case view includes: timeline, documents, internal notes, holds applied,
disclosure decisions, produced packages, and recipients.

C\) Legal Holds (Litigation / Investigations)

Apply hold to: user(s), booking(s)/LBG(s), studio(s), or a time range
across systems.

Effect: freezes deletion jobs, retention clocks, and purge eligibility
for the bound entities; banners appear in Admin entity timelines.

Hold reasons: litigation, LE request, internal investigation, tax/audit.

Release hold: requires twoperson approval; reasons recorded; downstream
purge job reevaluates.

SLA reminders: hold reviews every N days; stale holds flagged.

D\) Retention Schedules & Purge Jobs (USfirst)

Policy profiles (editable, with Legal approval):

Operational data (bookings, receipts, payouts): 7 years.

Chat/message content: 2 years (unless tied to dispute/hold).

Moderation & T&S case records: 5 years.

Logs/telemetry (nonfinancial): 30--90 days depending on sensitivity.

Uploads (thumbnails/manifests): as long as portfolio item exists;
deleted 30 days after account deletion unless under hold.

Tax records (W9/1099 summaries): 7 years; forms stored encrypted with
restricted scope.

Purge engine: nightly job evaluates each record against policy & holds;
performs softdelete → grace → harddelete; writes a purge ledger entry
with counts and IDs (masked).\
Simulation mode: preview impact before policy changes; "blastradius"
diff and rollback window.

E\) Data Subject Requests (DSR) --- Access / Deletion / OptOut

(USonly launch; CPRAstyle patterns to futureproof.)

Access/Export (Data Copy)

Intake: authenticated user or verified requestor; scope (account,
timeframe).

Output: ZIP with JSON/CSV for profile, settings, bookings/LBG, receipts,
messages (thread transcripts), reviews, references, moderation decisions
(nonconfidential summaries), verification statuses (pass/fail),
consents.

Redactions: thirdparty PII (emails/phones) masked unless consent or
legal basis; background/tax data summarized, not raw.

Hash manifest and cover letter (generated via §4.14.10).

SLA target: 45 days (configurable).

Deletion (Right to Delete)

Eligibility rules: block if active booking/dispute/chargeback/hold or
retention obligations (finance/tax).

Partial deletion: remove public content (portfolio/feed), mask profile,
stop discoverability; preserve billing/contract records under retention
and any items under legal hold.

Tombstone logic: display "Deleted User" on historic threads/receipts.

Coolingoff window (e.g., 14 days) with cancellation option; after
window, irreversible purge runs (except retained records).

SLA: 45 days to complete when eligible.

OptOut (Sale/Sharing of data / Marketing)

Track consent and optouts; update messaging lists; record timestamp,
IP/device.

Do Not Sell/Share toggle (futureproof); tie to analytics adsharing flags
if applied later.

Status tracker: per request: received → verifying → in progress →
completed/denied (with reason). Templates for responses in §4.14.10.

F\) Discovery & Production (Civil/Criminal)

Search & collect: entity filters (user, booking range, city), keyword
search across chats and metadata, time bounds.\
Review workspace: preview items with PII masked by default; unmask
gated; tag (responsive/nonresponsive/privileged).\
Redaction tools: blocklist (emails/phones/payment handles), manual
area/line redaction in PDFs, autoredact minors' identifiers.\
Production packages:
