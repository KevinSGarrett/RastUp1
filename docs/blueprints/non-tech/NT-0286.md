g Summary of §5.7)

Disclaimer: This document is a policy and process blueprint intended for
product and operations planning. It does not constitute legal, tax, or
compliance advice. Consult qualified counsel before publishing external
policies or taking actions that create legal obligations. All examples
are illustrative and may need adaptation for jurisdiction‑specific law.

Context & Alignment: We are launching a US‑only creative marketplace
focused on models, photographers, videographers, and content creators.\
We have chosen a subscription‑free go‑to‑market with monetization via
take‑rate and optional, usage‑based promotions that are
eligibility‑gated and capped.\
Public content is artistic‑nudity‑only; Safe‑Mode defaults for guests
apply. Deliverables are transferred via external storage (Drive/Dropbox)
with immutable manifests.\
Payments flow through card (3DS where required) and ACH (with a
buyer‑fee discount); funds are escrowed and released on acceptance.\
Instant Book is gated by ID verification; background checks are opt‑in
(Trusted Pro). Feature flags and city gates are used for reversible,
auditable launches.\
Admin consoles enable Support, Trust & Safety, Finance, and Ops to
perform routine tasks without code changes.

Goals:\
• Explain plainly what data we collect, why, and how we protect it.\
• Honor least‑privilege access, masking, and audit trails for PII.\
• Offer user controls (exports, deletion where applicable) and clear
contact channels.

Scope & Applicability:\
Applies to all personal data processed in connection with accounts,
bookings, messaging, payments, and safety operations within the United
States.

Definitions (plain language):\
• PII: information that identifies a person (e.g., name, email, phone)
and sensitive identifiers (DOB, TIN).\
• Vault: secure store for sensitive fields; access restricted and
audited.\
• Data Subject Request (DSR): a user request for access, correction, or
deletion of their data where applicable.

Policy Statements:\
• Data minimization: collect only what we need to operate and secure the
service (identity, payments, safety).\
• Purpose limitation: do not repurpose data for unrelated advertising;
usage limited to service operations and safety.\
• Security: encryption in transit and at rest; tokenized payments;
masked PII in admin; JIT elevation for sensitive unmasking.\
• User controls: profile edits; download receipts; data export on
request; account closure flow with data retention explanation.\
• Third parties: share data only with processors and vendors necessary
to deliver the service; contracts require security and privacy
safeguards.\
• Children: 18+ only; remove accounts if discovered to be underage;
report where required.

Procedures & Operational Playbooks:\
• DSR flow: intake → verify identity → scope data → fulfill → log;
denial templates for narrow exceptions.\
• Breach response: incident roles; containment; notification thresholds;
post‑mortem with remediation tasks.\
• Access reviews: quarterly RBAC review; remove stale admin accounts;
rotate secrets on schedule.

Enforcement & Remedies:\
• Enforcement: violations of access policy trigger investigation;
repeated misuse leads to employment action; all actions audited.\
• Appeals: users can escalate DSR outcomes via support; internal privacy
officer reviews edge cases.

Data, Privacy & Retention:\
• Retention schedule: finance records, releases, and SOW timelines;
purge jobs for expired artifacts; legal hold overrides documented.\
• Transparency: publish privacy summary with last‑updated date; log of
material changes.

Templates & Required Notices (internal/external):\
• Templates: DSR intake; identity verification steps; breach notice
skeleton; privacy summary page; vendor due‑diligence checklist.\
• Training decks: PII handling and phishing drills; admin console
privacy controls primer.

Compliance Metrics & Audits:\
• DSR SLA; time to revoke stale admin access; secrets rotation
adherence; privacy incide
