§11.2 --- Trust & Safety Risks (Harassment, Impersonation, Off‑Platform
Harm, Policy Drift)

Risk & Process Disclaimer: This section is an internal risk‑management
blueprint. It does not constitute legal, tax, or security advice.
Coordinate with counsel and security leaders before externalizing any
policy or committing to obligations. All examples are illustrative and
must be adapted to the realities measured in Section 5 dashboards.

Context & Alignment: US‑only marketplace launch; subscription‑free
start; monetization via take‑rate and usage‑based promotions with strict
eligibility and caps. Public content is artistic‑only with Safe‑Mode
defaults for guests. Deliverables are exchanged via external links
(Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests; escrowed payments release on
acceptance. Instant Book requires ID verification; background checks are
opt‑in (Trusted Pro). Rollouts are city‑gated behind feature flags.
Admin Console enforces least‑privilege, JIT elevation, two‑person
approvals, and full audit trails.

Goals:\
• Reduce likelihood and impact of safety incidents involving harassment,
doxxing, impersonation, or off‑platform harm.\
• Keep public content within artistic‑only boundaries; maintain
Safe‑Mode defaults for guests.\
• Ensure consistent moderation with appeals and examples to avoid drift.

Risk statements (top of mind):\
• Harassment/doxxing in DMs or feeds leading to user harm and PR
blowback.\
• Impersonation or fake profiles enabling scams or unsafe bookings.\
• Underage appearance risk; failure to detect minors in media or
accounts.\
• Policy drift causing inconsistent enforcement across cities and
moderators.\
• Off‑platform incidents tied to bookings (safety at shoots).

Primary causes & contributing factors:\
• Insufficient rate limits, weak report tools; unclear consequences.\
• Weak IDV adoption; lax selfie‑to‑ID checks; stock images in profiles.\
• Lack of classifier support; no birthdate consistency checks.\
• Inadequate training; missing examples; subjective decisions without
guidance.\
• Poor venue controls; lack of trusted contact features; unclear house
rules.

Leading indicators & early warning signals:\
• Spike in harassment reports; higher block rates; trending topics
calling out the platform.\
• Chargeback narratives citing impersonation; increased \'scam\'
reports.\
• Reports about age; \'minor\' flags from models; vendor alerts.\
• Appeal reversal rate high; inter‑moderator variance in similar cases.\
• Safety reports post‑booking; law‑enforcement contacts; negative
reviews citing safety.

Preventive controls & mitigations:\
• Stronger rate limits; spam heuristics; \'report & block\' prominent;
doxxing macro and removal.\
• IDV gate for Instant Book; selfie checks; image forensics on profile
media.\
• Age checks in onboarding; minors policy training; escalations to T&S
lead.\
• Policy examples gallery; moderation calibration sessions; QA on
decisions.\
• Trusted contact links; area‑share during booking; studio verification;
house rules.

Incident playbooks (summary):\
• Harassment surge: rate limit new senders; lock threads pending review;
publish anti‑harassment stance.\
• Impersonation ring: mass review of recent signups; require IDV before
messaging; remove offenders.\
• Minor risk: freeze account; verify; remove media; contact authorities
if required.

RACI / Owners:\
• Trust lead, Moderation team, Support, Legal liaison, Studios PM.

Instrumentation & success metrics:\
• Harassment reports per 1,000 legs; appeal reversals; impersonation
takedowns; IDV adoption; safety incident rate.

Thresholds & triggers (Go/No‑Go, rollback, escalation):\
• Harassment ≥ threshold → enable stricter defaults; impersonation
cluster → require IDV for new DMs.

Dependencies & assumptions:\
• Section 8 policies; §4.14 admin moderation t
