K\) Experiments (first 8--12 weeks)

Saved search alert frequency: immediate vs daily batch.

"Book again" reminder timing: +14 vs +30 days.

Case study autoprompt: shown at acceptance vs at review submission.

Referral reward mix: DM credits vs \$ buyer credits impact on bookings.

Feed ranking weights: followheavy vs citytrending weight.

Touring chip CTR: prominent vs subtle card.

L\) KPIs & Targets (90day per city)

Activation: sellers sending a first Quick Quote ≥ 55%; buyers sending a
first Smart Invite/RFP ≥ 60%.

Habit: ≥ 30% of activated users complete 2+ bookings in 60 days.

Repeat: ≥ 35% of bookings are repeat buyer↔provider pairings by month 6.

Saved searches: alert → click ≥ 18%; click → booking ≥ 6%.

Boards: ≥ 45% of active buyers maintain ≥1 board; board revisit rate ≥
2×/month.

Referrals: ≥ 15% of new users join via invite; fraud rate on referrals
\< 1%.

Winback: ≥ 12% of risk cohort reactivated; ≥ 8% of churn cohort return
within 30 days.

Feed: poster → inbound inquiry uplift ≥ 10% vs nonposters; toxicity \<
0.5%.

M\) Acceptance Criteria (mark 3.8 FINAL)

Saved searches with ANY/ALL logic (incl. social metrics and nudity
tiers), daily batched alerts, onetap unsubscribe.

Follows/Boards with status tags, external share links, and board refresh
"Fresh" chips.

Unified feed with role filters, Safe Mode gating, availability/touring
cards, case studies, verified promo posts.

Referral system (twosided) with caps, KYC gating, fraud checks, and
credit types (DM, RFP, buyer fee credit).

Rebooking buttons with prefilled scopes; brief templates and onetap
rebroadcasts.

Lead & utilization nudges, pricefit hints, touring assist.

Comms controls & caps (channels, quiet hours, Safe Mode email policy).

Winback flows for risk/churn; pause mode; exit survey & remediation
tasks.

Analytics: lifecycle stage dashboards, loop performance (saved search →
booking, referral ROAS, feed → inquiry).

N\) Why this works

Selfreinforcing: Each completed job seeds reviews, tags, case studies,
and "book again" triggers that bring both sides back.

Buyer clarity = speed: Saved searches, boards, and brief templates
shrink timetoaward.

Fair & safe: Visibility comes from trust and performance; Safe Mode
protects brand and compliance.

Costefficient: Credits (DM/RFP/buyer fee) and smart nudges drive
retention without monthly paywalls.

§3.9 --- Support, Refunds, Disputes & Knowledge Base

Goal: Resolve issues quickly and fairly, protect users in urgent
situations, keep most cases selfserve, and preserve trust & margins.
Make outcomes predictable (clear matrices), evidencebased (manifests,
checkin/out, verified posts), and brandsafe.

A\) Principles

Selfserve first, human when needed. Most changes/cancellations/refunds
can be initiated inthread and settled automatically under clear rules.

Evidence \> rhetoric. We rely on Delivery Room manifests, autochecks,
checkin/out, and Smart Docs to decide.

Timeboxed resolution. Cure windows and decision SLAs keep money and
media from lingering.

Safety has priority. P0 lifesafety routes to Safety team immediately;
fees are waived where appropriate.

Transparent playbook. The same refund matrix applies to everyone; it's
visible in the KB.

B\) Contact Channels & Triage

Channels (launch):

Inthread "Get help" (contextual flows for that booking).

Account Help (global: billing, verification, policy).

Email/webform fallback.

Triage & priority:

P0 --- Safety/Emergency (live/just occurred): response target ≤ 5 min,
24/7 oncall.

P1 --- Timecritical booking (\<24h): response ≤ 30 min during coverage
hours.

P2 --- Active booking / delivery in progress: ≤ 4 h.

P3 --- General/billing/policy: ≤ 1 business day.

Selfserve flows available from "Get help":

Change date/time, add/remove addons, adjust travel, request refund,
report noshow, report safety issue, delivery problem, chargeback info,
verification help.
