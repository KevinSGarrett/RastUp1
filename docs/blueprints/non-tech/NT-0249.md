• Chargebacks & disputes: represent with receipts, chats, manifests,
releases; escalate only within policy.

Data, Privacy & Retention:\
• PII as least‑privilege: mask until unmask reason is given; audit
access; limit retention to business needs.\
• Evidence retention: keep contracts/releases 7 years; keep booking
receipts by finance policy.\
• Data localization: US‑region storage only at launch; reviewed before
any international expansion.

Templates & Required Notices (internal/external):\
• Policy change notice; adverse‑action templates; DMCA intake form;
emergency disclosure checklist; Safe‑Mode rationale; accessibility
statement.\
• Receipt and SOW templates with plain‑English summaries; background
check notices; appeals form.

Compliance Metrics & Audits:\
• Safety reports per 1,000 legs; time to first response for safety
tickets; dispute win/loss rate; privacy access ledger reviews;
accessibility audit completion.\
• Quarterly policy review cadence tracked; change log published; on‑call
drill pass rate.

Risks & Mitigations:\
• Mismatched policy and product behavior → deploy behind flags with
clear copy to reduce misreads.\
• Over‑collection of data → minimize and vault PII; delete unneeded
fields; mask by default.\
• Unclear content boundaries → publish visual examples; train
moderators; default Safe‑Mode for guests.
