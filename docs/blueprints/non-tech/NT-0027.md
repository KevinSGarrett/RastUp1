Provider proposes moving shoot from Sat 10am to Sun 2pm:

Buyer must Accept/Decline; if decline, original remains; provider can
counter or cancel under policy.

Provider realizes commute is shorter; waives travel fee:

Applies immediately; buyer notified; escrow reduced; new receipt issued.

Buyer asks for 10 extra edited photos after the shoot:

Provider uses Add Extras → Buyer accepts → card charged → escrow up;
addendum stored.

Provider wants to upgrade to "Premium Package" price:

Sends Custom Offer Amendment → Buyer accepts → incremental charge;
deliverables updated; new PDF.

Shoot ended early (90 min vs 2 hours):

Provider issues partial refund (30 minutes); buyer notified; payout
reduced accordingly.

11\) Acceptance Criteria (QA)

Provider can initiate all actions above from "Manage Booking" with no
admin.

Consent rules enforced exactly as in matrix; autoapprove honored.

Amendments generated, versioned, and esigned where applicable; PDFs
attached.

Escrow & fees recompute correctly for increases/decreases and
afterpayout adjustments.

Locks prevent lastminute unilateral changes; proposals respect windows.

Calendars/ICS and notifications update on acceptance.

Audit trail shows who changed what, when, and why.

Abuse controls (caps, cooldowns, score impact) function.

12\) Why this works

Providers get full operational control (no support tickets).

Buyers retain consent over anything that costs them more or gives them
less.

The platform keeps money math and contracts accurate---minimizing
disputes.

Autoapprove rules + locks make the system fast but safe.

Addendum to §1.4 --- Storage & Deliverables (Large Files, External
Hosting, Feasibility) --- FINAL

Goal: Support professional photo/video delivery (including sets in the
tens/hundreds of GB) without the platform bearing heavy storage/egress
costs. Keep acceptance/disputes solid by capturing verifiable manifests
and reviewquality previews.

A\) Storage Model (Launch)

Hybrid by design

Small assets to platform (review quality): thumbnails, contact sheets,
lowres proxy video, PDFs; typical perfile cap ≤ 500 MB.

Originals offplatform (required for large sets): Google Drive, Dropbox,
OneDrive, Box, S3 presigned links owned by the provider.

External Delivery Modes (supported at launch)

OAuthconnected mode (preferred): Provider links Drive/Dropbox once. We
fetch file lists/metadata (name, size, modified, MIME, share URL),
generate a manifest and pin it to the booking.

Linkonly mode (no OAuth): Provider pastes share links (folder or file).
We crawl the listing (where permitted), and store a readonly manifest
(names/sizes/paths).

Checksum support: For platformuploaded items we compute hash; for
externals we store content length + etag (if available). Provider can
optionally paste SHA256 for each final file; we store/compare.

Review Previews (onplatform)

Photos: autogenerated webres JPEGs (e.g., long edge 2048px) for client
review.

Video: lowres proxy transcodes (e.g., 720p) for spotchecking length/cut;
no original uploads required.

Watermark policy: Watermarks allowed on previews; finals must be
watermarkfree (autocheck).

Retention & Liability

Platform stores previews + manifests for 365 days; not a longterm
archive.

Providers must keep external links intact for at least 30 days
postacceptance (and until dispute window closes); after that, retention
is their responsibility per contract.

Security & Access

Accepts tokenized share links and/passwordprotected links (password
stored encrypted).

We never mirror entire external folders by default. Limited, ephemeral
caching is allowed for preview generation only.

B\) Delivery Room Rules (updated)

Manifest is truth: Acceptance/disputes reference the pinned manifest
(counts/specs/filenames/sizes).

Spec autochecks: Count, MIME/codec, pixel dimensions, bitrate/duration,
color profile; flags must be cured before acceptance or go to dispute.

"All finals delivered" toggle: Provider asserts completeness; system
