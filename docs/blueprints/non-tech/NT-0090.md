 & accessibility targets
met.

L\) Why this works

Bookable storefronts: Every role's page converts (clear packages,
availability, and CTAs).

Signalrich but simple: Badges, social chips, and a transparent Rep score
reduce risk without clutter.

Multirole clarity: Each role stands on its own merit; switching is
explicit; reviews/reputation never mix.

Network effects: Tagging, case studies, and follows tie profiles
together, lifting discovery and retention.

§4.5 --- Studio Listing (Public & Host Views)

Goal: Make studios a clean, trustworthy, creativeready space type that
buyers can book in minutes or attach to a talent checkout---without
turning the product into a venue marketplace. Keep policies, payouts,
reviews, and reputation spacescoped and separate from people roles.
