• Copy & Policy: All flows have help‑center articles and email/SMS
templates; copy avoids legalese and links to policy examples.\
• QA & Drills: Staging mimics production data shapes; drills include
processor/tax outages, moderation surges, and incident command
handoffs.\
• Experimentation: Features that affect marketplace economics (ranking,
boosts, fees) include holdouts and guardrails; we measure incremental
impact.\
• Data Wiring: Events land in Bronze/Silver/Gold (§5); KPIs pull only
from Gold with freshness SLOs. Definitions live in a metrics catalog.\
• Accessibility: New UI complies with WCAG 2.1 AA; screen‑reader and
keyboard paths verified; contrast ratios checked; defects triaged.\
• Security & Privacy: PII masked by default; JIT elevation for sensitive
admin actions; vendor scopes minimal; audits immutable.\
• City Readiness: City‑first artifacts (press kit, creator ambassadors,
studio partners) prepared in §10.1 runbook.\
• Post‑Launch: 7/30/90‑day reviews convert observations into roadmap
changes; flags let us tune by city without forks.

Roadmap Disclaimer: This is an internal planning document. Dates are
placeholders and will firm up as Section 5 telemetry validates
conversion and quality gates. All items ship behind flags and city
allowlists. Nothing herein creates external commitments.

Context & Alignment: US‑only creative marketplace; subscription‑free at
launch; monetization via take‑rate and usage‑based promotions with
eligibility gates and strict caps; public content limited to
artistic‑only (guest Safe‑Mode on by default); deliverables handled via
external links (Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests; escrowed
payments released on acceptance; Instant Book gated by ID verification;
optional background checks confer Trusted Pro; city‑gated rollout with
feature flags; strong Admin Console with least‑privilege, JIT elevation,
two‑person approvals, and immutable audits.

Timeframe & Scope:\
• Applies to all phases; reviewed monthly; ratcheted only after
sustained performance.

Goals:\
• Make phase transitions objective and auditable with clear,
city‑specific thresholds.\
• Avoid premature scaling; unlock hiring and spend based on evidence.

Product Themes:\
• Evidence‑based progress; city‑gated rollouts; fairness and trust
non‑negotiable.

Workstreams & Deliverables:\
• Define phase gates for Alpha, Beta, GA, and city expansions; publish
in Admin; tie to flags.\
• Create board‑level KPI pack (§9.8) with red/yellow/green bands and
owners.

Feature Flags & City Gates:\
• gate.alpha.exit, gate.beta.exit, gate.ga.entry,
gate.city.expand.{city}, gate.promotions.on

Dependencies & Inputs:\
• §5 dashboards; §10 drills; §11 risks; §9 financials; §8 policies.

Top Risks & Mitigations:\
• Threshold myopia; metric gaming; noisy early data; city differences
ignored.

Instrumentation & KPIs:\
• Per phase: S→I, I→B, repeat %, dispute loss, payout latency, IDV %,
Trusted Pro %, promotions ROAS (if on), support SLA, tax variance.

Acceptance Criteria (Go/No‑Go):\
✓ All gates green for the period; no Sev‑0/1; help‑center parity; admin
coverage for edge cases; board sign‑off for expansions.

Staffing & Ownership:\
• City GM, Product, Trust, Finance, SRE, Data --- each signs their gate.

Milestones & Checkpoints:\
• Alpha exit; Beta entry; GA entry; City‑2/3 launches; promotions GA;
studios beta/GA; mobile GA.

Implementation Notes:\
• Flag Discipline: Each capability ships behind a named flag with a
runbook, owner, rollback, and blast‑radius notes. Flags default to
\'off\' in new cities.\
• Admin Operability: No workstream is \'done\' until admin tools enable
Support/Trust/Finance to handle the top 3 edge cases without
engineering.\
• Copy & Policy: All flows have help‑center articles and email/SMS
templates; copy avoids legalese and links to policy examples.\
