Moderation, Support, Finance/Tax, Studios Ops, Product.\
What it covers: Curated dashboards, drilldowns, cohorting/segmentation,
scheduled reports, anomaly alerts, CSV/JSON exports.\
Guardrails:

RBAC mirrors §4.14.1 (Admin Security).

PII masked by default; unmask requires scope + reason.

LBG vs leg metrics are clearly labeled.

All numbers show definition tooltips linking to the Metric Catalog.

B\) Metric Catalog (sourceoftruth)

Catalog entries include: name, owner, business definition, SQL/logic
hash, event sources, time grain, inclusions/exclusions, and version.\
Examples

gmv_total (LBG sum, excludes deposits; refunds netted)

bookings_count (LBG count; includes completed & accepted scheduled)

take_rate_net ( (provider_fee + buyer_fee − processor_fees −
invalid_click_credits) / GMV )

rep_score_avg (roleweighted, timedecayed average)

promos_roas_incremental (holdoutbased; §3.3)

safety_incidents_per_1k (P0+P1 cases / 1,000 LBGs)

calc_error_rate_tax (tax calc exceptions / tax calc requests)

Governance

Every dashboard tile references a catalog key with version (e.g.,
take_rate_net@v2).

Changes trigger deprecation windows and "what changed?" diffs.

C\) Data Freshness & Reliability

Freshness badges on every page: "Updated 8 min ago" with SLA:
nearrealtime (≤15 min) for ops; daily for monthend finance.

Backfill indicators when a replay job is running; "partial" banner on
affected tiles.

Data Quality checks: completeness, duplicate event ratios, referential
integrity (e.g., booking has a city & role), schema drift alarms.

D\) Dashboard Library (curated)

D1. Marketplace Health (Companywide)

Lighthouse tiles (last 7/28/90): GMV (LBG), Bookings (LBG), Net
Takerate, Active Supply by role, Verified %, IB share, Inquiry→Booking
%, Repeat booking %, CSAT, NPS, Safety incidents /1k, Chargeback rate &
win %, Invalid click rate.

Trends: by city & role; stacked time series with YoY/DoW controls.

Drilldowns: click GMV → city→role → provider decile → booking list.

D2. City Ops Dashboard

Targets vs actuals (from §4.14.9): supply targets, ratios, verified

Actions: jump links to cohort builder or playbooks.

D3. Growth & Activation

Funnel: Invite → Signup → ID Verify → Publish packages → First booking →
