rs, oneclick mitigations) and fair
where it's complex (evidence, neutral review, expiring strikes).

Prevention + response: a configurable rule engine reduces incidents;
strong playbooks resolve the rest.

Auditable endtoend: preserved evidence, hashed manifests, reasoned
decisions, and measured quality.

§4.14.4 --- Content Moderation

Goal: Keep the platform SFW by default, protect users from harmful or
deceptive content, and maintain highquality discovery. Combine automated
screening, human review, clear policies, and appeals---with auditable
outcomes and city/role tunability via §4.14.2.

A\) Scope & Content Types

Moderated surfaces

Profiles (avatar, cover, bio), Service Profiles (per role), Portfolio
(images/videos), Feed posts, Reviews & responses, Studio pages (photos,
amenities), RFP briefs (buyer text), Gig listings/cards (search cards,
ribbons).

Not public but scanned

DM attachments (virus only; policy checks on reported threads),
Deliverables manifests (names/sizes/hash only), House Rules/SOW text
(for prohibited clauses).

Policy anchors (SFW)

Allowed: artistic, nonsexual imagery; fashion/fitness/glamour; implied
nudity that remains SFW in previews.

Prohibited: explicit sexual content; pornographic poses; fetish content;
solicitation of sexual services; child/younglooking sexualized content;
hateful symbols; doxxing/PII in public fields; offplatform payment
steering.

OnlyFans / Fansubscription creators: supported as "Creators", but no
explicit content is uploaded or displayed; metrics/identity only (per
§4.13).

B\) Pipeline Overview (Upload → Screen → Publish)

Upload → temporary pending state (placeholders with skeletons).

Automated screening (subsecond):

NSFW classifier (preview threshold from §4.14.2
classifier.threshold.preview).

Nudity mask: detects areola/genital zones; triggers autocrop/blur
overlay tool.

OCR for embedded PII (emails, phone #, payment handles).

Text filters on titles/captions/hashtags (slurs, sexual solicitation,
offplatform payment phrases).

Duplicate/perceptual hash check (copyright/banlist).

Virus/malware scan (for videos).

Policy decision:

Autopublish if fully SFW (green).

Borderline → autoblur/autocrop; publish with "sensitive" overlay;
enqueue human review SLA ≤ 24h.

Block & queue if explicit/illegal or disallowed text (red).

Human review (moderation queue) → Approve / BlurandPublish / Remove with
reason / Escalate to T&S (§4.14.3).

Publish → search cards always use SFW thumbnails; portfolio detail uses
SFW or blur taptoreveal (if marked sensitive but allowed).

Firsttime uploader policy: premoderate first N=10 portfolio items
(editable via §4.14.2) to set quality baseline.

C\) Queues & SLAs

Priority A (P0/P1 handoff from T&S): explicit sexual/child
safety/violent threats → immediate takedown, SLA 15--30 min.

Priority B (policy/borderline): nudity boundaries, hate symbols,
offplatform payment steering → SLA 24 h.

Priority C (quality/metadata): miscategorization, spam,
duplicate/loweffort → SLA 72 h.

Queue cards show: surface (profile/portfolio/feed), uploader role, city,
verification badges, classifier confidence, prior violations, and report
count.

D\) Rules by Surface

Profiles & Service Profiles

Avatar/cover must be SFW; bios may not include contact handles or
payment details; location granular to city (no home address).

Role tags and NSFW switches are not usercontrolled; they derive from
content classification and policy.

Portfolio

Must remain SFW in preview. If artistic nudity is present, the system
enforces autocrop/blur for thumbnails and grid previews.

No exposed genitals; female nipples not visible in previews; implied
nudity ok with strategic coverage.

Feed posts

Same preview constraints as portfolio; no explicit calltooffplatform
payments; collaboration tags require consent (accept/deny).

Reviews

Disallow slurs, harassment, doxxing, explicit language; allow
experiencebased criticism.

Only verified booking participants can post (per §1.4).
