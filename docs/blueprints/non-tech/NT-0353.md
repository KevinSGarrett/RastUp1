0.0 --- Alpha → Beta → GA Readiness Checklists

§10.0 --- Alpha → Beta → GA Readiness Checklists

Operational Disclaimer: This playbook bundle is an internal execution
guide. It is not a public policy document. Where compliance or legal
actions are required, consult Section 8 and counsel. Where money flows
change, consult Sections 3 and 4.

Context & Alignment: Our launch approach is city‑by‑city with nationwide
signups allowed, starting in Houston. We launch subscription‑free,
monetize through take‑rate and usage‑based promotions with strict
eligibility and caps, and keep public media within an artistic‑only
boundary with Safe‑Mode defaults for guests. Deliverables are handled
via external links (Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests. Instant
Book requires ID verification; background checks are opt‑in (Trusted
Pro). Payments include card (3DS when required) and ACH (with a reduced
buyer fee). Feature flags and city gates control blast radius, and the
Admin Console enables Support, Trust, Finance, and Ops to act without
code changes.

Goals:\
• Gate each phase with objective, measurable criteria that reflect
trust, money, performance, and usability.\
• Prevent premature scaling by requiring admin operability and
auditability before GA.\
• Create clear ownership and escalation across squads for go/no‑go
decisions.

Alpha Exit (internal users + selected creators):\
□ Core loop works: search → inquiry → booking → deliverables manifest →
acceptance → payout queued.\
□ Admin: support can amend receipts, issue partial refunds, and view
audits without engineering help.\
□ Trust: IDV on; Safe‑Mode default; moderation queue staffing plan;
appeals path.\
□ Money: ACH enabled in sandbox; card 3DS tested; buyer fee math and
provider fee discounts validated.\
□ Data: §5 events land in Gold tables; dashboards for S→I, I→B, GMV
live; DQ gates pass.\
□ Docs: help‑center drafts for refunds, Safe‑Mode, deliverables
manifest; support macros.\
□ Flags: list of city gates and blast radii documented; rollback plans
linked.

Beta Entry (Houston public beta):\
□ Invite list seeded: 300--500 verified providers across roles; demand
waitlist activated.\
□ Support staffed for local hours; Trust trained on playbooks; finance
close daily green for 7 days.\
□ Tax engine on for allowlisted Texas rules; receipts itemize taxes
where applicable.\
□ Promotions disabled by default; holdouts and caps configured for later
v1.\
□ Performance SLOs met for search, messaging, checkout; synthetics are
green.

GA Entry (Houston):\
□ KPIs hit: S→I ≥ 20%, I→B ≥ 35%, repeat bookings ≥ 30% at 60 days.\
□ Dispute loss rate ≤ target; payout latency ≤ 48h; moderation SLA met.\
□ Promotions v1 on with caps; ROAS median ≥ 2.5×; invalid‑click credit
\< 7%.\
□ Support SLAs achieved for 30 days; knowledge base completion ≥ 90%.\
□ Incident drill passed: checkout failover, tax outage, and moderation
surge.

Owners & Roles:\
• GM (city) --- owns go/no‑go and stakeholder comms.\
• Product leads --- own feature flags and acceptance criteria.\
• Trust lead --- owns safety SLAs and appeals.\
• Finance lead --- owns daily close, payouts, tax receipts.\
• SRE --- owns SLOs, incident drills, and rollback tests.

Instrumentation & Readiness Signals:\
• Alpha and Beta dashboards with S→I, I→B, GMV, payout latency, dispute
rates, moderation SLAs.\
• Error budgets per surface (search, messaging, checkout): burn tracked
in weekly business review.\
• Flag registry with owners, blast radii, city gates, and rollback
steps; last‑tested timestamp.

Top Risks & Mitigations:\
• Soft launches slip into GA without readiness → enforce hard gates and
require sign‑off from Trust and Finance.\
• Admin gaps force engineering ops → refuse GA until support can act
without code changes.

Acceptance Criteria (Go/No‑Go):\
✓ All GA gates green for 14 consecutive days.\
✓ No Sev‑0s in last 14 days; Sev‑1 MTTR within target; drill passed in
last 30 days.\
✓ Help‑center content audited; macros cover top 20 issues.
