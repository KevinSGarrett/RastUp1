Execute & Monitor → progress bar, perbatch logs, error bucket with
retry.

Notify (optional) → attach Smart Docs/Comms templates (§4.14.10) to
inform impacted users.

Rollback (if supported) → oneclick create inverse job template prefilled
from snapshot.

Job record includes: actor, reason code, linked ticket, scopes, filters,
dryrun snapshot hash, approvals, schedule, outcome stats, CSV of
affected IDs (downloadable, masked).

C\) Users & Accounts --- Merge & Normalize

Use cases: duplicate signups (email + social), creator with split role
accounts, brand team consolidation.

Actions:

LinkandHold (soft stage, reversible 7 days): mark profiles as aliases;
both URLs redirect to a canonical; present "pending merge" banner in
Admin; no data is moved yet.

Finalize Merge (irreversible): unify login identities, verifications
(highest wins with audit), W9/TIN (prompt to pick primary; alternate
archived), payout method (choose primary), portfolios (dedupe media via
hash), reviews (union), Rep score (recompute with decay), DM threads
(reassign to canonical), promotions wallets (sum balances), boards
(union).

Role/Profile Reparent: move a service profile (e.g., Photographer) from
user A to user B (rare; requires proof + approvals).

Guardrails:

Twoperson approval; no ongoing payout/chargeback on either account; no
active safety cases.

Rollback: only from LinkandHold. After Finalize, a reversal = new merge
job in opposite direction not allowed (must escalate to engineering).

Comms: notify both emails; require reauth next login.

D\) Bookings & LBG --- Relate, Retime, Addenda

Use cases: early legs created separately need grouping; acceptance
window policy changed; stormrelated deliverables extension.

Actions:

Link to LBG: select talent/studio bookings within same buyer + window →
create Group; generate Group Receipt (§4.12).

Unlink leg (rare): leg removed from LBG (keeps its receipts); requires
Support case link.

Acceptance Window Extend: push acceptance due date by N days on open
bookings (config max).

Deliverables Due Shift: move due dates; optional autoaddendum via Smart
Docs; both parties notified.

Policy Addendum: attach a SOW/House Rules addendum to future or open
bookings; requires reaccept in thread.

Guardrails: no money lines altered unless paired with Change Order;
respect city policy keys (§4.14.2); log all changes & notify.

E\) Money --- Safe Bulk Refunds / Credits / Fee Fixes

Use cases: processor outage partial refunds, tax miscalc in one
state/day, goodwill credit wave after access failures.

Actions:

Refunds (partial/full): reasoncoded; perline (packages, addons, travel,
license); recompute fees/taxes; issue amended receipts (§4.12).

Credits (platform wallet): city/role scoped; expirations; ledger post
(§4.14.6).

Fee Adjustment (rare): buyer or provider fee correction for window;
twoperson approval; bounded by floor/cap.

Deposit Voids (studio): mass void for auths expiring due to outage.

Guardrails:

Global caps: max \$ per booking, \$ total, \# rows; chargebackexcluded;
safety cases excluded.

Dual approval; dryrun shows totals; Finance visibility during execution.

Rollback: credits reversible (issue offset); refunds not (issue
countercharge only with consent → avoided).

F\) Promotions --- Campaign Adjustments

Use cases: raise floors citywide; pause Featured during outage; align
active bids to new floors.

Actions:

Pause/Resume active Boost or Featured campaigns (filters: city×role, Rep
tier, budget left).

Floor Alignment: if bid \< floor, autoraise to floor (optin); notify
providers.

Budget & Dates: extend end dates, add makegood credits.

Bulk credit for invalid clicks during incident (ties into §4.14.8
wallet).

Guardrails: eligibility enforced; Finance ledger posts; notify affected
users (template).

G\) Search/Index & Social --- Reindex, Recalc, Resync

Use cases: new facet weights; rep formula tweak; social API outage
recovery.

Actions:

Reindex profiles/search with new §4.
