ng location verification flow.

References: both Verified (auto) and Community (approval + lower weight)
displayed and factored into reputation.

Reputation Score computed, explained, visible (role & overall), and
emitted as a signal to §1.2 for filters/sorting.

Safety enhancements: trusted contact, areashare, preshoot tips, and
InstantBook suppression are implemented.

🔁 CrossReferences & Placement Notes

Keep API feasibility and platform lists under §1.2 (they power search
filters and profile chips).

Keep verification badge definitions, References, Reputation, and Safety
under §1.5; §1.2 only describes how search uses those signals.

Paid Boosting: you added it here for visibility (good); the commercial
model, pricing, caps, and governance will be fully specified later in
Monetization & Growth. §1.2 only defines how boosted results render
inside search (fairness rules).

Addendum to §1.5 --- Trust & Safety (Data & Privacy) --- FINAL

Data minimization: Store attestations/metadata (manifests, hashes, sign
logs), not raw originals.

PII & legal docs: Signed PDFs retained; access restricted to parties +
safety/legal on needtoknow basis.

External link hygiene: Encourage passworded links; warn about public
links; store passwords securely.

Addendum to §1.5 --- Trust & Safety

Policy & Reputation Protection

Allowed: SFW content and artistic nudity (nonexplicit), promo posts,
teasers; collaborations with fansubscription creators as long as
onplatform media is nonexplicit.

Prohibited: explicit sexual content/acts, pornography, escorting/sexual
services, fetish content, "sexting" deliverables, paid subscriber
DMs/PPV facilitation.

Age & ID: IDverified 18+ required to list as FanSubscription Creator.

Visibility controls: Safe Mode default hides 18+ roles; user must optin
to view.

Enforcement: AI + human review; 3strike policy; instant adsuppression
and Instant Book disable during investigations.

Payments: Our mainstreamprocessor compliance is maintained (no explicit
content facilitated or hosted).

Acceptance criteria

Safe Mode default; age gate; explicitcontent detection in uploader;
rapid enforcement flows.

Addendum --- §1.5 Trust & Safety (Studios) --- FINAL

Goal: Define clear, studiospecific safety, verification, privacy, and
policy rules that protect buyers, hosts, and talent---without diluting
our artisticonly content policy or Safe Mode behavior. Keep enforcement
predictable and tooling light.

A\) Policy Scope & Definitions (Studios)

Studio = Space Listing (placebased). Trust controls apply to the space,
not a person's role.

Host = Account owner of a Studio listing.

Buyer = The party renting the studio (may be a brand, photographer, or
creator).

Artisticonly policy applies to all bookings: onplatform bookings may
include artistic nudity; explicit sexual content/acts are prohibited (no
adult content production facilitated or booked through the platform).

B\) What We Verify (Studio Lite)

Address & Ownership/RighttoRent: government/utility/lease doc + name
match; geocode/place match.

Basic Safety Disclosures: max occupancy, egress, rules summary (noise,
strobe, haze, open flame, ladders).

Host Identity: host must be IDVerified; background checks (Trusted Pro)
remain peoplerole only.

Badge: passing shows Verified Studio.

Note: Studio Lite is not a building inspection or insurance substitute;
it's a light authenticity & disclosure check.

C\) Required Documents & Gating (per booking)

Smart Docs autoattach for Studio bookings:

Property/Space Release (host ↔ buyer)

House Rules (host authored; standardized fields)

Safety Addendum (if strobe/haze/open flame indicated)

Esign before checkin: access instructions (door code) unlock only after
signatures.

Minors: if talent under 18, Minor/Guardian Release required (already in
§3.5/§3.7); studios can display "No minors" if host policy forbids.

D\) Safe Mode & Visibility

Safe Mode (18+) affects people profiles and feed content, not studio
visibility.
