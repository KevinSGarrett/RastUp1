an review queue
operational.

Safety Flag → highpriority triage with suppression of Instant Book for
accused until triage.

Checkin/out timestamps; optional generalarea pin; privacy defaults
respected.

Enforcement ladder & strike counters with expirations; audit log of
actions.

Risk scoring, payout holds/reserves for new accounts; KYC gating before
payouts.

Evidence retention and export for disputes/chargebacks.

Safety Center content published; support SLA timers visible to ops.

M\) Why this will work

Visible trust reduces hesitation and increases conversion.

ID/Background checks + contracts make inperson shoots feel professional
and safe.

Automoderation + incentives keep money onplatform and lower support
load.

Evidencefirst approach shrinks dispute duration and chargeback loss.

Addendum to §1.5 (Trust)\
Trust, Safety & Verification

Recommendation: Insert these as new subsections after your existing
verification stack and safety features (e.g., §1.5.G → §1.5.K). Leave
any search UI behavior in §1.2; keep definitions, badges, scoring,
safety flows here.

§1.5.G Studio & Location Verification

Studio Verified (badge): owner uploads address + supporting document
(lease/utility/biz registration). Staff performs a onetime check. Badge
appears on profile; exposed to search as "Studio access: verified."

Booking Location Verification (optional at checkout):

If buyer selects a known verified studio, no extra step.

Private addresses remain private; after acceptance, provider may request
location verification (lightweight place check). If unresolvable, show a
warning to both parties.

Touring calendar (from §1.2 travel): pairs well with verified studios
for safer first meetings.

§1.5.H References

Verified References (auto): created from completed onplatform bookings
(role + date). Contribute to reputation score.

Community References (optional): past collaborators can submit a
reference; recipient must approve; platform lightverifies metadata
(e.g., linked post/file). Lower weight; clearly labeled.

Search tiein: §1.2 exposes "Has verified references (≥ N)" filter.

§1.5.I Reputation Score (0--100)

Purpose: oneglance confidence, without replacing detailed info.

Formula v1 (roleaware, timeweighted):

Reviews & volume (rolespecific) --- 40%

Reliability (ontime, completion, noshow, dispute rate) --- 25%

Responsiveness (median first response time; consistency) --- 10%

Verifications (ID, Background, SocialVerified, Studio) --- 15%

Recent performance (last 90 days) --- 10%\
Negative events (late cancels, noshows, dispute losses) reduce sharply
and decay over time.

Display:

Score ring + "Why this score?" breakdown.

Rolespecific and overall values (use role score in role search).

New users show "New --- building reputation" (no penalty for being new).

Search tiein: §1.2 adds Min Rep Score filter and Top Reputation sort;
Rep used as tiebreaker after core relevance factors.

Gaming protections: weight by review volume and recency; cap any one
factor; monitor anomalies.

§1.5.J Safety Expansions

Trusted Contact link (optional): share booking summary + checkin/out
timestamps with a designated contact via secure link.

Generalarea location share (100--150m fuzzing) during active bookings;
clear "stop sharing."

Preshoot safety tips injected into chat 24h before firsttime meetings.

Autosuppress Instant Book during active safety investigations.

Privacy for highprofile users: alias display names; reveal precise
address only after confirmation.

§1.5.K Acceptance Criteria (Trust addendum)

Studio Verified badge live; optional booking location verification flow.

References: both Verified (auto) and Community (approval + lower weight)
displayed and factored into reputation.

Reputation Score computed, explained, visible (role & overall), and
emitted as a signal to §1.2 for filters/sorting.

Safety enhancements: trusted contact, areashare, preshoot tips, and
InstantBook suppression are implemented.
