If only one can move → buyer chooses to split the group (proceed with
one, cancel the other per its policy) or cancel both per each policy.

Price adjustments:

Talent: change orders/addons as usual.

Studio: hours & cleaning adjustments; additional fees quoted before
reauth.

F\) Onsite Flow: CheckIn/Out & Overtime (studios)

Checkin/out: geofenced Start/End taps; logs timestamps and duration.

Overtime: billed per listing rule (e.g., per 30 min at 1.5×).

If overtime detected (End \> booked End), host files a PostBooking
Adjustment within 24h with evidence (checkout log, photos).

Buyer has 48h to accept/dispute; we may autoapprove if evidence is clear
(policy toggle).

Crew size overage / rule violations: host can submit an adjustment claim
with evidence within 24h (caps & allowed reasons defined in listing).

G\) Cancellations, NoShows & Safety (group and pertype)

Pertype matrices apply independently (talent follows talent policy;
studio follows studio policy).

Group UX: buyer sees a combined summary showing outcomes for each
booking.

Host cancel (studio): buyer gets 100% refund on studio + \$25--\$50
goodwill credit; talent booking remains unless buyer also cancels it.

Safety exception: unsafe conduct → waive platform fees, refund
appropriately, and open Safety case; access to space can be revoked
remotely if applicable.

Noshow:

Studio: if buyer fails to check in within grace window and host was
present/available → studio payout per matrix; deposit not captured
unless damage or specific violation.

H\) Damage Deposits & Claims (studios)

Hold timing: authorize at checkout or 24h prior (host preference);
release 48h after checkout if no claim.

Claim flow: host opens claim within 24h with photos & description;
amount requested up to hold cap.

Adjudication: Neutral Review may approve full/partial capture or deny;
capture appears as a separate charge (not escrow).

Abuse guard: repeated frivolous claims throttle host visibility and may
remove deposit privileges.

I\) Completion & Payouts

Studio completion trigger: autocomplete on successful checkout (no
deliverables).

Talent completion trigger: acceptance of deliverables or autoaccept per
§1.3/Delivery Room rules.

Payout timing:

Studio: 24--48h after checkout, minus adjustments under review.

Talent: 48h after acceptance/autoaccept.

Early Payout (peruse): available to eligible hosts/providers (Rep ≥ 85)
with the 0.5% acceleration fee as defined in §3.2 (peruse, not
subscription).

J\) Receipts, Taxes & Invoices

Unified receipt shows two sections (Talent • Studio), fees, taxes (if
any), deposit hold (authorization only), and separate cancellation
policies.

Taxes: talent services vs space rental may differ by locale; we surface
hostprovided tax settings; lineitemized.

Documents: signed Smart Docs (Service Agreement, Property/Space Release,
House Rules) downloadable from the booking thread.

K\) Edge Cases & Safeguards

Doublebooking protection: instant revalidation of studio availability at
payment step; if collision, buyer gets a failsafe choice (waitlist or
alternative suggestions).

Early exit: no refunds for unused time unless host agrees; checkout time
is source of truth for overtime only (not undertime credits).

Access failures (e.g., bad code): host must provide alternate access
within 30 min; otherwise buyer may cancel for cause (full refund).

Travel fees: remain talentonly; no travel fees on studio bookings.
