occupancy cap, gear usage, cleanup, alcohol/drugs, pets, minors on set,
chaperone policy, privacy areas, changing area rules.

Safety Addenda (optional): ladders/rigging rules, fog/haze restrictions,
electrical load limits, mandatory COI for certain rigs.

Autoinsert clauses based on amenities (e.g., cyc wall → no shoes/scuffs;

runbooks).

Disputed capture → Neutral Review (§4.14.5) with evidence pack.

F\) Access Management & Lockout Handling

Access types: onsite host, code lock, concierge checkin, key pickup;
captured in House Rules.

Lockout signals: repeated code failures, buyer "at door" SOS, phone

provided) → if host fault, refund path + deposit void; if buyer fault,
apply policy bands.
