ant Book (--1%) + Trusted Pro (--0.5%)

Buyer service fee (5%): 0.05 × 600 = \$30 → Buyer pays \$630

Provider fee base (12%): \$72

Discounted provider fee (10.5%): 0.105 × 600 = \$63

Provider takehome: \$600 − \$63 = \$537

Platform revenue preprocessing: \$63 + \$30 = \$93

Processing (2.9% + \$0.30) on \$630: \$18.57

Net to platform (before ops): \$74.43.

Example 3 --- \$85 booking, smallorder check

Buyer service fee: 5% of \$85 = \$4.25 (≥ \$3 min, so min does not
apply) → buyer pays \$89.25

Provider fee (12%): \$10.20 → provider takehome \$74.80

Processing on \$89.25 (2.9% + \$0.30): ≈ \$2.89

Platform net (preops): (10.20 + 4.25) − 2.89 ≈ \$11.56

On very small bookings (e.g., \$30), the \$3 min protects margin---where
many peers set \$3--\$3.50 smallorder addons.

D\) Pricing transparency & UX rules

Oneline disclosure at checkout: "Platform fees include secure escrow,
contracts, support & payment processing."

Provider dashboard "takehome preview" per package (and optional "include
estimated card fees" toggle).

Refund/discount edits autoreissue amended receipts for both sides (see
§1.4 addendum).

City promos show strikethrough fees (e.g., "Buyer fee \~5%\~ → 0% this
month in Houston").

ACH discount labeling: clearly show "Pay by bank (save 2% on fees)" once
ACH is enabled; this mirrors buyerside fee reductions on comparable
platforms.

E\) Antileakage incentives (why pay through us)

Protection value: escrow, platform contracts/releases, dispute handling,
verified reviews, Pro analytics.

Economics: lower provider fee for Instant Book and Trusted Pro;
eligibility for paid Search Boost gated by onplatform performance.

Friction: gentle inchat warnings on offplatform payment attempts; repeat
attempts throttle newconversation sends (see §1.4/§1.5).

F\) Edge cases & policy notes

Dispute outcomes: platform retains the buyer fee only when buyer is at
fault; if we rule for the buyer due to provider fault, we refund the
buyer fee (mirrors common guest/host fee treatments).

Chargebacks: a disputehandling fee (e.g., \$15) may be charged to the
losing party only in clear abuse; otherwise we absorb processor dispute
fees.

Taxes: where services are taxable, fees are calculated on the taxable
base appropriately; receipts itemize taxes separately.

NSFW policy alignment: mainstreamfirst (artistic nudity allowed),
enabling mainstream processors and avoiding adultcontent
surcharges/payout friction.

Refunds & processor fees: card processing fees on the original
transaction are not returned by processors; our policy and tooling
reflect this.

G\) Acceptance criteria (to mark 3.1 FINAL)

Fee engine supports 12% provider + 5% buyer (min \$3); ACH buyer fee 3%;
stackable discounts (Instant Book −1%, Trusted Pro −0.5%, 10% on portion
\> \$1,000) with floor 9%.

Buyer fee refunded on providerfault cancellations/safety exceptions;
nonrefundable on buyerinitiated cancels.

Payouts: 48h standard; newprovider reserve policy configurable by
cohort; Early Payout addon ready for §3.2.

Receipts/invoices autoupdate after amendments/discounts; totals
consistent with escrow.

Provider dashboard shows takehome preview; checkout shows clear fee
blurb + tooltip; ACH discount is surfaced when available.

Analytics capture net platform revenue per booking, fee mix, and impact
of discounts on conversion.

H\) Why this works (postresearch)

Marketaligned: 12% provider sits below or near sector peers (15%+ on
Collabstr/Swipecast/Peerspace; Fiverr takes 20% from sellers), while 5%
buyer with \$3 min mirrors buyer fees at Fiverr/Upwork.

Profitable from day one: buyer fee largely covers card processing;
smallorder min prevents negative unit economics; ACH discount reduces
payment costs and attracts highervalue buyers.

Growthpositive: discounts for Instant Book and Trusted Pro increase
conversion and safety; highvalue tier encourages larger jobs to stay
onplatform (a pattern users recognize from legacy fee ladders).
