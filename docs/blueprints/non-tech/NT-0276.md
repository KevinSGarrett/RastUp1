sh: off‑platform payments are prohibited within the UI; repeated
attempts can throttle messaging.\
• Tips: zero platform fee; optional and processed post‑completion.

Procedures & Operational Playbooks:\
• Support macros: standard refunds; reschedule; partial refunds;
provider‑fault; chargeback kits.\
• Admin tools: re‑issue receipts; partial refund apportionment; deposit
auth/capture logs for studios.\
• Finance close: daily reconciliation; settlement variance alarms; tax
export by jurisdiction.

Enforcement & Remedies:\
• Outcomes: refund issued, denied (with rationale), partial; chargeback
won/lost; ACH return resolved.\
• Abuse controls: refund/chargeback abuse flags; repeat offenders lose
Instant Book or are limited.

Data, Privacy & Retention:\
• Sensitive data: card/ACH tokens only; we never store PANs; PII vaulted
and masked; least‑privilege on admin pages.\
• Retention: receipts kept per finance policy; chargeback evidence
retained for at least 18 months.

Templates & Required Notices (internal/external):\
• Templates: refund confirmations; chargeback narratives; ACH return
explanations; late‑cancel warnings.\
• Help‑center: \'How refunds work,\' \'What happens in a dispute,\'
\'Deposits for studios,\' \'Tips & payouts\'.

Compliance Metrics & Audits:\
• Refund SLA; representment win rate; settlement variance; ACH return
rate; average time to resolution; user satisfaction scores for money
tickets.

Risks & Mitigations:\
• Ambiguous refund copy → standardize; preview math in price box; reduce
surprises.\
• Evidence gaps → require manifest and acceptance; reduce \'not as
described\' disputes with SOW clarity.

Acceptance Checklist (ready to externalize):\
□ Macros published; finance reports green 14/14 days; chargeback kit
quality audits ≥ 95%; dispute loss rate trending down.
