templates should be usable with keyboard‑only
navigation and screen readers.\
• Privacy: avoid embedding real PII in examples; use placeholders
consistently.\
• City‑gates: where content varies by city, call out the delta
explicitly and tie to the corresponding feature flag.\
• Training: every appendix should have a 1‑page executive summary and a
\'how to use this\' section for Support/Trust.\
• Change control: every material change requires an entry in the
changelog, owner sign‑off, and a Slack announcement to the relevant
channel.

Implementation Notes:\
• Keep this appendix version‑controlled; link to the controlling owner
and next review date.\
• Align terminology with Section 1 UI labels and Section 5 metrics
catalog; avoid synonyms that confuse staff.\
• When examples include numbers, ensure they reconcile to Section 3.1
fee math and Section 4.12 receipts.\
• Accessibility: all templates should be usable with keyboard‑only
navigation and screen readers.\
