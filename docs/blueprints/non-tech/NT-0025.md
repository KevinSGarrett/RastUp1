MVP vs. Phase2

MVP

Unified inbox; roleaware threads; read receipts & typing

Project Panel (Summary, Schedule, Location, Participants, Brief,
Moodboard, Shot List, Call Sheet, Files, Contracts, Expenses, Actions)

Action cards (reschedule, extras, overtime, proofs/finals, expenses,
mark complete, dispute, safety flag)

File upload + watermark previews; external link capture

Safety flag, block/report, automoderation for offplatform attempts

DND; message requests; contact filters; quick replies

Notifications + ICS export

Phase2

Voice notes; lightweight video calls

Shared whiteboard for lighting diagrams

Realtime coediting of shot lists

Deep calendar writeback (Google/Apple)

Enterprise attachments (brand asset libraries)

Uber/Lyft vouchers (only if enterprise demand)

Inthread AI assist (generate call sheet, summarize chat, draft briefs)

N\) Acceptance criteria (for engineering & QA)

Unified inbox shows threads with role and type chips, filters and
bundles by counterparty.

Message requests workflow with Accept/Decline/Block; contact filters
honored.

Read receipts and typing indicators work across web & mobile.

Project Panel exists for Booking threads with all tabs; data stays
synced with booking object.

Action cards execute: reschedule, add extras, add overtime, upload
proofs/finals with approvals, mark complete, expense approvals, dispute
open.

File handling: previews, watermarks (toggle), versioning, external link
manifest, storage caps.

Safety: safety flag escalates; block/report works; automoderation nudges
on contact/offplatform phrases.

Notifications & DND behave per settings; ICS export for schedule.

Response time & reliability metrics update and feed search filters.

Accessibility: Keyboard navigation, proper aria labels; attachments
preview alttext.

O\) Rationale (why this will convert)

Role/booking context eliminates confusion for multirole users.

Project Panel centralizes everything---no lost emails, no conflicting
docs.

Action cards replace drawnout negotiation with onetap, auditable steps.

Safety & moderation reduce offplatform leakage and protect users,
increasing trust and repeat business.

Quick replies & templates lower response time, boosting search ranking
and request acceptance

Addendum to §1.4 --- ProviderManaged Changes & Adminless Ops

Goal: Let User B (provider) modify an existing booking with zero admin
intervention---reschedule, change price, add/waive fees, issue
refunds---while preserving buyer consent, clear contracts, escrow
accuracy, and an immutable audit trail.

1\) Change Types & Consent Matrix

2\) "Amendment" Object (Single Source of Truth)

Every approved change produces a versioned Amendment attached to the
Booking:

Fields changed (before → after), initiator, timestamp, reason code
(required), 双方 esign if it alters contractual terms (date, price,
deliverables, license).

PDF added to Contracts tab and to both receipts (for taxes and
disputes).

Audit trail (readonly) visible to both parties and Support.

3\) Provider Portal --- "Manage Booking" Actions

Propose New Time (Reschedule)

Date/time picker; optional note; shows buyer availability hints.

Autoapprove rules honored (see §5). Otherwise buyer gets Accept/Decline
card.

Apply Discount / Issue Partial Refund

Enter amount or %; choose reason (goodwill, less time, deliverables
adjusted).

Shows new totals, fee adjustments, and payout impact preview.

No buyer acceptance needed (refunds are onedirectional benefits).

Send Custom Offer Amendment (price ↑ / package swap / license change)

Configure new package/price/deliverables; optional extras.

Buyer receives an Amendment Offer card to Accept/Decline.

Add Extras / Add Overtime

Standard action cards; buyer must accept.

Incremental charge collected; escrow updated; contract addendum
