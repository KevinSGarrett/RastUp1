• Privacy: avoid embedding real PII in examples; use placeholders
consistently.\
• City‑gates: where content varies by city, call out the delta
explicitly and tie to the corresponding feature flag.\
• Training: every appendix should have a 1‑page executive summary and a
\'how to use this\' section for Support/Trust.\
• Change control: every material change requires an entry in the
changelog, owner sign‑off, and a Slack announcement to the relevant
channel.

Implementation Notes:\
• Keep this appendix version‑controlled; link to the controlling owner
and next review date.\
• Align terminology with Section 1 UI labels and Section 5 metrics
catalog; avoid synonyms that confuse staff.\
• When examples include numbers, ensure they reconcile to Section 3.1
fee math and Section 4.12 receipts.\

Appendix E --- Revenue Recognition Notes & Fee Math Examples (ties to
§3.1)

Generated on 2025-11-04 23:53:44 UTC

Purpose\
Document how platform fees are recognized under a marketplace model, how
refunds and adjustments are treated, and provide clear numerical
examples that match receipts (§4.12) and fee engine rules (§3.1).
Coordinate with accounting counsel for GAAP compliance. This is not
accounting advice.

E1. Revenue Streams & When Recognized

Provider fee (commission) --- recognized at the point the service is
delivered and accepted (or auto‑accepted). Buyer service fee ---
recognized at transaction processing; refunded on provider‑fault
cancellations per policy. Promotions revenue --- recognized on delivery
of impressions/clicks or over the weekly term for Featured.

E2. Escrow, Refunds, Adjustments

Escrow liability sits until acceptance; change orders adjust the
contract value; refunds reduce recognized revenue if already recognized;
otherwise release liability.

E3. Worked Examples (Step‑by‑Step)

• \*\*Example A\*\* --- Talent booking \$600; buyer fee 5%; provider fee
12% minus Instant Book 1% and Trusted Pro 0.5%; ACH used; show journal
entries for charge, escrow, acceptance, payout, fees.

• \*\*Example B\*\* --- Change order +\$100; acceptance delayed; buyer
cancels under rules; compute partial refund and fee impact.

• \*\*Example C\*\* --- Dispute resulting in 30% refund post‑acceptance;
show revenue adjustment and payout clawback if applicable.

E4. Journal Entry Patterns (Illustrative)

Include debits/credits for cash, escrow liability, revenue (provider
fee, buyer fee), processor fees, promotions, refunds/chargebacks,
