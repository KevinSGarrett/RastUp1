ruth for partner
status (prospect, NDA, pilot, GA), contacts, contracts, scopes, and
SLAs. Tag all features behind partner flags and city gates to avoid
blast‑radius mistakes. • Privacy & Data: Apply least‑data
principles---only request scopes needed for the user value; rotate
tokens; revoke access on inactivity. • Security & Audits: Vendor
SOC/pentest reports stored with expiry reminders; incident bridges
pre‑arranged for Sev‑1/Sev‑0. • Co‑Marketing Discipline: Announce after
pilots prove value; enforce clear success metrics; align PR/brand tone
with our artistic‑only policy. • Support & Playbooks: Create
partner‑specific macros; train Support/Trust on integration quirks; log
incidents with partner tags. • Measurement: Attribute partner impact in
§5 dashboards (e.g., ACH share by vendor, IDV completion rate by
provider, studio attach from verified partners). • Contracts: Avoid
exclusivity unless compensated; require termination rights, data
return/delete clauses, and uptime credits for SLA misses. • City
Sequencing: Some partners launch in founding cities only; we gate by
city to manage operational readiness. • Accessibility & Inclusion:
Ensure partner widgets meet WCAG 2.1 AA; provide text alternatives and
keyboard navigation.\
• Ethics & Brand Safety: Decline partners whose practices conflict with
user safety or our policy posture; include an ethics review in intake.

Purpose\
This appendix standardizes the language and responsibilities used across
the plan. It prevents ambiguity across product, engineering, trust &
safety, support, finance, legal, data, and city ops. It aligns directly
with Sections 1 (UX), 3 (Monetization), 4 (Architecture), 5 (Data), 8
(Policies), 10 (Launch), 11 (Risk), and 12 (Roadmap).

A1. Core Marketplace Terms (Plain‑English)

• \*\*Buyer\*\* --- The party paying for a service (e.g., photographer

later phases). May be an individual or a business/brand account.

(model, photographer, videographer, content creator). A single person
can hold multiple roles.

studio/location for shoots (phase‑gated).

• \*\*Service Profile\*\* --- A role‑specific profile (e.g., \'Model\',
\'Photographer\') under one account, each with its own packages,
availability, reviews, and pricing.

• \*\*Package\*\* --- A priced bundle (time, scope, deliverables) a
provider offers. Buyers can add extras and licensing.

• \*\*Instant Book\*\* --- Booking flow that does not require explicit
provider approval. Requires ID Verification; can be toggled by the

date/time/scope/price, proposed by either party and accepted by the
other.

immutable external‑link manifest for evidence.

• \*\*Acceptance Window\*\* --- Time after deliverables are posted for
the buyer to accept or raise issues before escrow releases
automatically.

• \*\*LBG (Linked Booking Group)\*\* --- A multi‑leg booking (e.g.,
talent + studio) paid as one transaction with separate receipts.
Phase‑gated.

• \*\*Reputation Score\*\* --- A 0--100 score derived from reviews,
reliability, responsiveness, verifications, and recent performance
(role‑aware, time‑weighted).

• \*\*Verified/Trusted Pro\*\* --- Badges for ID‑verified users and
background‑checked users, respectively.

• \*\*Promoted / Boosted\*\* --- Paid visibility units (capped, labeled,
