 where lawful.\
• Chain of custody: hash and inventory produced files; store in
restricted evidence repository.\
• Emergency requests: accept via official channels; require written
confirmation; log and review post‑hoc.

Procedures & Operational Playbooks:\
• Admin integration: §4.14.15 legal holds; evidence tagging; restricted
access groups.\
• Escalation: counsel reviews; senior approval for content disclosures;
regular audits of requests.

Enforcement & Remedies:\
• Enforcement: deny improper requests; seek to quash where appropriate;
document refusals and reasons.\
• Abuse reporting: if a request appears abusive, escalate; do not comply
until clarified.

Data, Privacy & Retention:\
• PII minimization in productions; redact third‑party PII where not
requested; secure transfer methods; retention per legal hold schedule.

Templates & Required Notices (internal/external):\
• Templates: subpoena intake form; user notice; emergency disclosure
form; production cover letter; denial letter.\
• Logs: request register with dates, types, outcomes; annual
transparency report summary.

Compliance Metrics & Audits:\
• Request volume; mean time to legal review; % of requests narrowed;
transparency report cadence.

Risks & Mitigations:\
• Improper service → train intake; scope creep → insist on narrow
requests; confidentiality orders → track notice restrictions and expiry.
