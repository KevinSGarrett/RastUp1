ity.\
• Prioritize partners that accelerate conversion (ACH, IDV), safety (BG,
studios), and differentiation (social metrics, RFPs).\
• Set common legal, security, and commercial patterns to speed
negotiation and onboarding.

Target partner segments:\
• Money stack partners: processors, ACH, tax engines, payout banks.\
• Trust stack partners: ID verification, background checks, e‑signature,
moderation tooling.\
• Discovery & data partners: social platforms, analytics providers,
SEO/media affiliates.\
• Supply partners: verified studios, equipment rental, education
programs, creator communities.\
• Demand partners: brands, agencies, RFP aggregators, small‑business
networks.\
• Workflow partners: file storage (Drive/Dropbox), calendar, chat/Slack,
Zapier‑style automation.

Mutual value proposition:\
• Faster, cheaper, safer transactions → better conversion and margins
(ACH discounts, stable payouts).\
• Higher safety signals → more Instant Book, fewer disputes, better
trust and reviews.\
• Richer discovery (verified social metrics) → better matching, higher
booking value.\
• Lower CAC via co‑marketing (studios, schools, brand networks) →
cheaper city launches.\
• Improved retention via tools users already use (Drive, Dropbox,
Calendar, Slack).

Selection criteria & due diligence:\
• Security posture (SOC, pentest, breach history), data minimization,
token scopes, deletion flows.\
• Commercial flexibility (no exclusivity, volume tiers, credits for
outages, predictable pricing).\
• API quality and rate limits; reliability; sandbox support; SDKs;
webhooks.\
• Legal friendliness (DPAs, FCRA support for BG, clear liability
boundaries).\
• Cultural alignment: creator‑friendly, brand‑safe, responsive support.

Integration scopes & surfaces (what we build):\
• Wallet/payment: card, ACH, refund, payouts; tax quotes; receipts
hooks.\
• Trust: IDV widgets, BG consent flows, FCRA notices; e‑signature for
SOW/releases.\
• Discovery: social platform connects; metrics ingestion; verified
chips.\
• Workflow: Drive/Dropbox file manifests; ICS calendar sync;
Slack/Zapier notifications.

Commercial & legal patterns (illustrative):\
• Standard: pay‑as‑you‑go per‑use fees (IDV/BG); processor % rates; tax
quote per‑call; e‑signature per envelope.\
• Volume tiers after city 2--3; uptime credits; no minimums in year 1 if
possible.\
• Co‑marketing exchanges: logo placement, landing pages, co‑webinars,
city PR mentions.

Enablement & co‑marketing (how we launch together):\
• Technical: feature flags, city allowlists, fallback paths, incident
runbooks.\
• Go‑to‑market: co‑branded pages, case studies, launch kits for
studios/schools/brands.\
• Support & Trust: macros and escalation paths; quarterly business
reviews with vendors.

Top risks & mitigations:\
• Vendor lock‑in; scope creep; privacy risk; cost overrun; PR
misalignment.\
• City‑specific regulatory quirks; rate‑limit throttling; API
regressions.

Operational playbooks (summary):\
• Vendor outage → roll to fallback; banner comms; reconcile later;
post‑incident credits.\
• API change → freeze flag; version pin; contact vendor; hotfix; staged
re‑enable.

Owners & RACI:\
• Head of Partnerships (DRI), Legal, Security/SRE, Product owners
(Money/Trust/Search), City Ops.

KPIs & leading indicators:\
• Partner‑attributed conversion lift; ACH share; IDV completion; Trusted
Pro adoption; studio attach; RFP response rates.\
• Cost‑to‑serve per booking by partner; uptime; incident counts;
co‑marketing leads.

Acceptance criteria (ready / successful when):\
✓ Playbooks and fallback paths tested; DPA/SLA signed; partner flags
live in staging and one city; dashboards attribute lift.

Timeline & checkpoints:\
• Quarterly partner pipeline review; 30‑day pilot → 60‑day evaluation →
GA or deprecate.

Scenario Playbook --- Partner PR misalignment:\
Trigger: Partner promotes explicit content conflicting with our
artistic‑only stance.\
Response: Pause co‑marketing; reassess; require alignment statement;
restrict surface
