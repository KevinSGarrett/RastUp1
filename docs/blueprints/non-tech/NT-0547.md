A4. Term/Label Canon (UI vs Data vs Legal)

We maintain a canonical mapping of UI labels, data field names, and
legal language to avoid drift. Example:\
UI: \'Change Order\' → Data: change_order_event → Legal: \'amendment\'.
UI: \'Buyer fee\' → Data: buyer_fee_amt → Legal: \'Service fee\'.

A5. Acceptance & Ownership

Owner: Product Ops. Review cadence: quarterly. Change control: PRD +
Slack #product‑ops; update Help Center and Admin copy on change.

Implementation Notes:\
• Keep this appendix version‑controlled; link to the controlling owner
and next review date.\
• Align terminology with Section 1 UI labels and Section 5 metrics
catalog; avoid synonyms that confuse staff.\
• When examples include numbers, ensure they reconcile to Section 3.1
fee math and Section 4.12 receipts.\
• Accessibility: all templates should be usable with keyboard‑only
navigation and screen readers.\
• Privacy: avoid embedding real PII in examples;
