) Content & Microcopy Guidelines

People vs Places: always say "Studio" for spaces; never "venue" at
launch.

Badges: keep labels short: "Verified", "Trusted Pro", "Verified Studio",
"Instant Book", "Promoted".

Policies: use plain language ("Cancel by 7 days for full refund").

Safety: avoid alarmist tones; be clear ("House rules apply; cameras must
be disclosed").

Email/push: never show 18+ previews; SFW copy only.

E\) Accessibility & Error Patterns

AA Contrast for all text & icons; verify with tooling in CI.

Keyboard & Screen Readers: focus trap in modals, labeled inputs, ARIA on
tabs/drawers, logical heading order.

Hit targets: 44×44 px minimum.

Errors: inline + summary; link to KB where relevant; keep technical
jargon out of user copy.

F\) Performance & Media Guidelines

Images: lazyload, responsive srcset, WebP/AVIF where supported; max card
image \~120--200KB.

Video: autogenerate lightweight proxies (muted, no autoplay on mobile);
never embed heavy originals.

Icons: sprite or treeshaken; defer OAuth SDKs until user opens Social
Connect.

Skeletons: render within 100ms to reduce perceived latency.

G\) Telemetry (componentlevel events)

card.click (type=person\|studio, promoted=true\|false)

chip.click (type=verified\|trusted\|studio\|instantbook\|social)

filters.open/apply/reset, saved_search.create/toggle

attach_studio.open/select, lbg.summary.expand

doc.sign/open, delivery.accept/request_revision

boost.create/pause, featured.purchase

verification.start/complete (step), social.connect

calendar.block/ib_window, reschedule.propose/accept

checkout.pay.success/fail

H\) Acceptance Criteria (mark 4.2 FINAL)

Foundations (tokens, type, spacing, breakpoints, motion) defined and
consumable.

Core components delivered: PersonCard, StudioCard, BoardCard,
CaseStudyCard, SkeletonCard.

Chips & badges for Verified, Trusted Pro, Verified Studio, Instant Book,
Social metrics, Promoted.

Search patterns: SearchBar, FilterDrawer (people + studio), Saved
Search, ANY/ALL social logic, Verifiedonly toggle.

Modals/Drawers implemented: Quick Brief, Attach a Studio, Quick Quote,
Change Order, PostBooking Adjustment, Damage Claim, Reschedule, Review
Composer, Safe Mode Toggle, Payment Method, OAuth Connect.

Delivery Room & Smart Docs components complete and reused in all flows.

Reputation & Reviews components wired to ranking tiebreaks and profile
displays.

Verification Center components (ID, BG, Social, Studio Lite) with unlock
blurbs.

Calendars, Checkout, Notifications/Toasts, Admin split views ready;
deposit actions supported.

Accessibility (AA) & performance budgets enforced; telemetry events
instrumented.

I\) Why this works

Consistency → speed: One library powers all surfaces---less time
prototyping, more time validating.

Clarity of types: People vs Places appear distinct (but complementary)
across cards, filters, and checkout.

Safety & fairness are visible: Badges, verified chips, Promoted labels,
and policy snippets make trust legible and ads honest.

Mobilefirst: Drawers, sticky bars, and concise cards keep flows fast on
phones.

§4.3 --- Auth & Onboarding Flows

Goal: Move new users from "curious" → first meaningful action fast, with
minimal friction and role/space awareness. Keep Safe Mode ON by default,
defer heavier checks (ID, Background, Studio Lite) until they unlock
value (Instant Book, badges, DM credits), and support multirole + studio
under one account.

A\) Principles

Fast path first: Light signin, ask current city, and immediately route
to a next action (Search, Quick Brief, Quick Package, or New Studio).

One account → many offerings: Users can create Service Profiles (roles)
and Studio Listings (spaces) under a single login.

Progressive verification: Verification is optional at first, but clearly
rewards users (Instant Book, DM credit boosts, badges, Early Payout
eligibility).

Safe by default: Safe Mode ON; FanSubscription Creator is agegated;
minors operate via guardian/agency (Phase 2).
