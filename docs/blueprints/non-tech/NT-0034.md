(lightweight)

Preshoot tips injected to the thread 24h prior ("Bring a chaperone if
preferred," "Share trusted contact," "Review house rules").

Trusted contact link: share session times & generalarea location with a
designated contact (fuzzed to 100--150m).

Safety banner on studio detail page: "Read House Rules & emergency exit
info on arrival."

N\) Acceptance Criteria (mark §1.5 addendum FINAL)

Studio Lite verification requirements documented and enforced
(address/righttorent + disclosures + host ID).

Smart Docs (Property/Space Release, House Rules, Safety Addendum when
applicable) autoattach; esign gating before access.

Safe Mode leaves studios visible; studio media SFWonly enforced in
uploader/moderation.

Surveillance & privacy rules enforced: disclosure required; no cameras
in private areas; signage for any recording.

Hazard toggles present; Safety Addendum injected when toggled; pyro/open
flame restricted without permits.

Accessibility fields added; misrepresentation enforcement path defined.

Emergency hooks (hotline, oncall), IB/boost suppression during
investigations.

Enforcement ladder (strike types, interim measures, removal)
implemented.

KB updates: "Studio Lite verification," "House Rules & Property
Release," "Cameras & privacy," "Hazards & permits," "Deposits & claims,"
"Artisticonly policy for studios."

O\) Why this works

Clear, minimal, enforceable: focuses on truths we can verify (address,
rules, cameras, hazards), not subjective promises.

Protects users & brand: artisticonly boundary, privacy rules, and strike
ladder guard against the highestrisk scenarios.

Lowlift ops: Lite verification + templated docs + hazard toggles keep
support scalable while giving buyers predictable safety signals.

SubSection 1.6 --- Support, Help Center & Knowledge Base

Goal: Resolve user issues fast, fairly, and consistently---with the
lowest support overhead possible. Blend selfserve (knowledge base,
guided flows, inproduct smart prompts) with human support that's
roleaware (Model/Photographer/Videographer/Creator), bookingaware, and
safetyfirst.

A\) Principles

Selfserve first: Articles, guided troubleshooters, and contextual
prompts resolve 70%+ without tickets.

Inthread resolution: Most issues are solved inside the booking thread
(refunds, extras, schedule changes) via action cards, not email
pingpong.

Safety & money prioritized: Safety; payment capture/escrow;
noshow/cancellation; disputes get elevated handling.

One source of truth: Contracts, chat, amendments, deliverables, and
receipts are the evidence for decisions.

Consistency over heroics: Clear policies, macros, and audit trails keep
outcomes predictable and defensible.

B\) UserFacing Support Channels

Help Center (web + mobile web)

Public, SEOfriendly articles; rolefiltered navigation; search with
synonyms and typotolerance.

"Was this helpful?" feedback; related articles; contact support CTA if
unresolved.

InProduct Help Widget

Contextual launcher on key pages (Search, Profile editor, Checkout,
Messaging/Project Panel).

Surfaces top articles + guided flows (see §C).

Booking Thread → "Get help"

One tap opens guided issue forms that preattach the booking ID and
autopulls context (policy chosen, timestamps, files exchanged).

Safety Flag lives here too (escalates directly to T&S).

Email form (fallback)

Web form that collects role, booking ID, category, severity; captures
device + browser autometadata.

(No phone support at launch; consider for enterprise later.)

C\) Guided Flows (Decision Trees)

Purpose: Solve or autoprepare the case before an agent sees it.

Payments & Payouts

"Charge failed" → suggest retry/readd method → if still failing, create
ticket tagged BILLING with last 4 of card, error code.

"Where is my payout?" → show payout timeline & status → if past SLA,
open PAYOUTDELAY with booking and bankonfile.

Reschedule/Cancel

Walks buyer/provider through policy windows; if within selfserve rules,
triggers Reschedule or Cancel act
