O\) Acceptance Criteria (mark 4.11 FINAL)

Inthread Get help launches contextual triage with policy preview,
evidence autoattach, and refund/charge preview.

Case types live for Talent, Studio, and LBG; Access issue is P1 with
fast lane to resolve/refund.

LBG outcome split view shows separate Talent/Studio results and a single
group summary.

Damage deposits: authorize/void/capture supported; no platform fee on
deposit capture.

Postbooking adjustments (overtime/overage/violation) supported with
evidence and timers.

UGC/promo verification integrated; minlive failures handled with one
retry then policy outcome.

Neutral Review path exists; SLA ≤ 5 business days; representment pack
exports.

Receipts & amended docs reissued automatically; tax/fees recompute
accurately.

Notifications (SFW) and timers implemented (24h/48h/5day); P1 studio
access resolves quickly.

Agent console provides macros, sanctions, deposit tools, and LBG split
outcome.

Telemetry & KPIs instrumented; dashboards track resolution rate, P1
solve time, chargebacks, and accuracy.

P\) Why this works

Predictable: Users see outcomes before filing; disputes don't feel
arbitrary.

Efficient: Autoevidence and policy math drive 70%+ selfserve resolution.

Chargebackresilient: Every case quietly builds the artifacts needed to
win bank disputes.

Fair & transparent: LBG keeps ledgers separate but summaries simple;
buyer fees and deposits behave exactly as stated in §3.1/§3.9.

§4.12 --- Payments, Payouts & Tax Center UX

Goal: Give buyers, sellers (talent), and studio hosts a clear,
trustworthy money hub: easy payments, transparent fees, predictable
payouts, multistate tax compliance, and clean audit trails---all
LBGaware, policyaccurate, and built to scale across U.S. states.

B\) Personas & What They Can Do

Buyer / Brand: add cards/ACH, pick default at checkout, download
receipts & invoices, set cost centers/PO (when enabled), view chargeback
status, manage RFP credit purchases.

Seller (Talent) / Host (Studio): connect bank for payouts, view payout
ledger & statements, enable Early Payout (if eligible), see fee math per
booking, complete W9 and download annual forms.

Dualrole accounts: both tabs visible; payouts combine earnings across
roles and studios but keep perbooking lines separate for audit.
