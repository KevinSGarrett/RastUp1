and immutable audits.

Timeframe & Scope:\
• T+240 to T+330.

Goals:\
• Run Studios Beta with limited slots; measure attach and claims;
iterate house rules and deposits.\
• Pilot LBG (talent+studio group checkout) behind invite; generate group
receipts; improve change‑order flows across legs.\
• Advance social metrics (growth, engagement presets); refine reputation
score with decay and role‑weighting.

Product Themes:\
• Broader use cases while preserving fairness and safety.

Workstreams & Deliverables:\
• Studios: verified badge; search filter; safety addenda; host
messaging; calendar blocks; cleaning fee modeling.\
• LBG: shared quote, split escrow; group receipt; per‑leg changes;
cancellation coordination; admin tools and auditing.\
• Social: per‑platform sliders; verified‑only toggle; growth trends;
\'High engagement\' presets; explanation tooltips.\
• Reputation: time‑weighted, role‑specific; \'Why this score?\' panel;
negative event decay and caps.

Feature Flags & City Gates:\
• feature.studio.beta=true (invite only), feature.lbg.checkout.beta=true
(invite only), feature.social.metrics.advanced, feature.rep.v2.

Dependencies & Inputs:\
• Processor for split captures; tax on deposits; host policy; moderation
capacity; help‑center expansion.

Top Risks & Mitigations:\
• Complexity overload; studio disputes; LBG reconciliation; user
confusion on social metrics and reputation.

Instrumentation & KPIs:\
• Studio attach and repeat; deposit claim rate; LBG conversion vs
single‑leg; dispute trends; social filter usage; rep distribution
health.

Acceptance Criteria (Go/No‑Go):\
✓ Studios Beta NPS ≥ target; LBG pilot stable; no regression to S→I/I→B;
support load manageable.

Staffing & Ownership:\
• Studios squad; Booking/Money squad; Data; Trust; Support; Finance.

Milestones & Checkpoints:\
• Studios beta retrospective; LBG pilot findings; decision on GA or
further beta.

Implementation Notes:\
• Flag Discipline: Each capability ships behind a named flag with a
runbook, owner, rollback, and blast‑radius notes. Flags default to
\'off\' in new cities.\
• Admin Operability: No workstream is \'done\' until admin tools enable
Support/Trust/Finance to handle the top 3 edge cases without
engineering.\
• Copy & Policy: All flows have help‑center articles and email/SMS
templates; copy avoids legalese and links to policy examples.\
• QA & Drills: Staging mimics production data shapes; drills include
processor/tax outages, moderation surges, and incident command
handoffs.\
• Experimentation: Features that affect marketplace economics (ranking,
boosts, fees) include holdouts and guardrails; we measure incremental
impact.\
• Data Wiring: Events land in Bronze/Silver/Gold (§5); KPIs pull only
from Gold with freshness SLOs. Definitions live in a metrics catalog.\
• Accessibility: New UI complies with WCAG 2.1 AA; screen‑reader and
keyboard paths verified; contrast ratios checked; defects triaged.\
• Security & Privacy: PII masked by default; JIT elevation for sensitive
admin actions; vendor scopes minimal; audits immutable.\
• City Readiness: City‑first artifacts (press kit, creator ambassadors,
studio partners) prepared in §10.1 runbook.\
• Post‑Launch: 7/30/90‑day reviews convert observations into roadmap
changes; flags let us tune by city without forks.
