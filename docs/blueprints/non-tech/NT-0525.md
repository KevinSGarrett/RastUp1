categories; SLA expectations; legal/brand safety
requirements.

Integration scopes & surfaces (what we build):\
• RFP creation and broadcast; preferred vendor folders; invoice/PO
flows; cost centers; API hooks later.

Commercial & legal patterns (illustrative):\
• No subscription at launch; usage‑based RFP credits; potential volume
credits; co‑marketing exchanges.

Enablement & co‑marketing (how we launch together):\
• Brand onboarding: brief templates; case study gallery; team training;
dedicated AM for \>\$10k/mo spend.

Top risks & mitigations:\
• Outsized support needs; discount pressure; scope creep; favoritism
perceptions.

Operational playbooks (summary):\
• Pilot with clear SLAs; report deck; mutually agreed KPIs; exit ramp if
not a fit.

Owners & RACI:\
• Brand Partnerships lead, Growth, Support/AM, Legal.

KPIs & leading indicators:\
• RFP volume; response quality/time; conversion rate; repeat spend;
CSAT; NPS.

Acceptance criteria (ready / successful when):\
✓ 3--5 anchor brands per city; RFP pipeline healthy; conversion ≥
targets; co‑marketing content live.

Timeline & checkpoints:\
• Begin in Beta with 2--3 brands; expand post‑GA; formalize AM tiering
later.

Scenario Playbook --- Brand requests \'pay‑to‑win\':\
Trigger: Asks for undisclosed ranking priority\
Response: Decline; explain fairness policy; offer Featured slots with
labels and caps; educate on filters and RFPs.\
Legal/Comms: Written policy and one‑pager; internal alignment.\
Roll‑back/Forward: N/A\
Owner: Brand lead \| Telemetry: brand_satisfaction, provider_feedback \|
Evidence: Email threads; policy docs

Implementation Notes:\
• Partner Governance: Maintain a single source of truth for partner
status (prospect, NDA, pilot, GA), contacts, contracts, scopes, and
SLAs. Tag all features behind partner flags and city gates to avoid
blast‑radius mistakes. • Privacy & Data: Apply least‑data
principles---only request scopes needed for the user value; rotate
tokens; revoke access on inactivity. • Security & Audits: Vendor
SOC/pentest reports stored with expiry reminders; incident bridges
pre‑arranged for Sev‑1/Sev‑0. • Co‑Marketing Discipline: Announce after
pilots prove value; enforce clear success metrics; align PR/brand tone
with our artistic‑only policy. • Support & Playbooks: Create
partner‑specific macros; train Support/Trust on integration quirks; log
incidents with partner tags. • Measurement: Attribute partner impact in
§5 dashboards (e.g., ACH share by vendor, IDV completion rate by
provider, studio attach from verified partners). • Contracts: Avoid
exclusivity unless compensated; require termination rights, data
return/delete clauses, and uptime credits for SLA misses. • City
Sequencing: Some partners launch in founding cities only; we gate by
city to manage operational readiness. • Accessibility & Inclusion:
Ensure partner widgets meet WCAG 2.1 AA; provide text alternatives and
keyboard navigation.\
• Ethics & Brand Safety: Decline partners whose practices conflict with
user safety or our policy posture; include an ethics review in intake.
