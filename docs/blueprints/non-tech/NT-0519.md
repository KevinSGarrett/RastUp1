Partnerships Disclaimer: This is an internal planning document for
partner strategy and ecosystem development. It does not create
commitments. All integrations ship behind flags, follow privacy
policies, and require vendor due diligence, DPAs, SLAs, and legal
review. Commercial terms are illustrative until negotiated.

Context & Alignment: US‑only marketplace at launch; subscription‑free;
monetization via take‑rate and capped, eligibility‑gated usage‑based
promotions. Public content is artistic‑only with Safe‑Mode on for
guests. Deliverables flow via external links (Drive/Dropbox) with
immutable manifests; escrow releases on acceptance. Instant Book is
gated by ID verification; background checks are opt‑in (Trusted Pro).
Rollouts are city‑gated behind feature flags; Admin Console enforces
least‑privilege, JIT elevation, two‑person approvals, immutable audits,
and kill‑switches.
