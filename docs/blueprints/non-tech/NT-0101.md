mpts are discouraged and throttled.

Low friction --- Replies are free; new conversation credits are the only
scarce resource (per §3.2).

LBGaware --- When Talent + Studio are booked together, keep threads
separate but coordinated, with Group Broadcast when needed.

B\) Thread Types & Routing

Inquiry thread (prebooking) --- starts from profile/search/brief invite.
Uses DM credit on the first outbound message only; replies are free.

Booking thread (Talent) --- created on acceptance/IB; status chips:
Booked → In progress → Delivered → Completed; shows escrow status.

Booking thread (Studio) --- created on acceptance/IB; shows access
details (masked until esign), deposit hold state, checkin/out status.

RFP thread --- buyer broadcast → provider reply; converts to
Inquiry/Booking on award.

LBG umbrella --- not a chat; a summary bar linking to the two booking
threads; supports Group Broadcast (see §I).

Routes: /messages (list) • /messages/{threadId} (detail) •
/messages?group={groupId} (shows both group threads with Broadcast
control)

C\) Layout (Thread Detail)

Header bar

Counterpart avatar & name • Role/Studio chip • City • Booking status
chip • Rep ring (0--100) mini • "View booking" • "View docs"

Rightside actions: Quick Quote / Change Order / Propose Reschedule /
Issue Refund / Get help (contextual, role/space aware)

Left (or main) pane

Message list (bubbles with timestamps, read receipts, link previews,
inline image/video previews with SafeMode filtering)

Pinned message (e.g., access code) shown atop until unpinned

Right (or drawer) pane

Summary card (dates, times, location neighborhood, price lines)

Docs (SOW, License, Release; Studio: Property/Space Release, House
Rules)

Delivery status (if talent thread)

Checkin/out (if studio thread)

Policies mini cards (cancel/refund window)

Group chip if part of LBG (tap to switch thread or use Broadcast)

D\) Composer & Message Types

Text (rich formatting minimal: bold, list, link)

Attachments: images, short clips (previewed), PDFs; virusscanned and
SafeMode filtered in public previews

Snippets/Templates: canned replies by role; perrole variables (price,
slots, packages)

Scheduling poll (propose 2--5 times)

Quick Quote (inline price proposal from package + addons → turns into a
booking when accepted)

Location picker (neighborhood only; exact studio address never sent
until docs signed)

Voice notes (Phase 2; text transcript required if enabled)

Emoji/ack (👍 etc.) to reduce noise

Credit logic:

Starting a new thread consumes 1 credit (per §3.2).

Replies, booking threads, and RFP replies do not consume credits.

If messages breach spam checks, sending slows or blocks (see §G).

E\) Pipeline, Automation & Reminders

Pipeline chips (auto): New • Needs Info • Quoted • Awarded • Booked •
Delivered • Completed

Autonudges (1/day max/thread) when: quote unanswered 48h, buyer hasn't
proposed times, docs unsigned, delivery unreviewed.

Snooze a thread (until date/time or after event).

Remind me later on action items (e.g., "Follow up on Tuesday").

F\) Quick Actions (contextual, policyaware)

Quick Quote (Inquiry → Booking)

Pick a package, adjust addons, travel, discounts; preview fee/takehome;
send quote.

Buyer taps Accept & Pay → goes to Talent checkout (or LBG if studio
already attached).

Propose Reschedule (Booking)

Propose new date/time (Talent or Studio); if LBG, system proposes
synchronized change to both bookings.

If only one can move, buyer picks: Split group or Change both later.

Change Order (Talent)

Add hours, addons, license tier changes; requote and reauthorize;
amended Smart Docs issued.

Issue Refund / Discount (Talent)

Partial refund or discount (policyaware); provider fee recalculates;
