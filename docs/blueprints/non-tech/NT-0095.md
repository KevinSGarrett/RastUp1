list uses PersonCard / StudioCard; Promoted units are labeled
and capped (≤2/20; ≤1 above fold).

Attach a Studio pill appears when a People search includes date/time;
drawer shows prefiltered studios; selection persists to checkout as
Linked Booking Group.

Sorting & ranking match the contract: relevance → availability →
distance → price fit → reputation → small nudges; paid never overrides
filters.

Saved Search with cadence (daily batch) implemented; management page
exists.

Boards/Compare/Invite shortcuts work from cards; boards accept mixed
types.

Performance & accessibility budgets met; skeletons present; map
optional; staledata badges visible.

Telemetry events fire as listed.

M\) Why this works

Roletrue filtering: Buyers get the exact knobs that matter for each role
(and studios), not gear trivia.

Social clarity: Perplatform targeting with verified chips lets brands
and creators find reach + engagement, not just follower tallies.

Fast planning: AttachinFlow collapses multisite planning into one
search + one checkout.

Fair & trustworthy: Relevance and availability rule; promotions are
clearly labeled and capped; Safe Mode protects brand and users.

§4.7 --- Checkout & Linked Booking Group

Goal: Make paying predictable, transparent, and safe for both Talent and
Studio bookings---whether purchased alone or together. Treat Talent and
Studio as separate bookings with independent policies & payouts, but
present a single, simple checkout and one receipt when bought together
via an LBG. Minimize dropoff with clear fees, policy previews, and fast
payment flows (Card, ACH).

A\) Entry Points & Routes

From People profile (Packages): Book / Request to Book →
/checkout/talent/{tempId}

From Studio page: Instant Book / Request → /checkout/studio/{tempId}

From Brief/Compare: Award → /checkout/talent/{tempId} (prefilled)

AttachinFlow (talent checkout): adds a Studio →
/checkout/group/{groupId}

Linked Group summary (always when 2 bookings present):
/checkout/group/{groupId}

B\) Checkout Structure (single vs group)

Singlebooking Checkout (Talent or Studio)

Details (date/time/duration, package or hourly calc)

Docs (Smart Docs pack)

Payment (card/ACH)

Confirm

Linked Booking Group (Talent + Studio)

Group header with two panels: Talent \| Studio (expand/collapse)

Steps: Review → Docs → Payment → Confirm

Policies & totals displayed per booking, with a group total at bottom.

Atomicity: The LBG confirms only if both bookings succeed
(payments/holds). If one fails, the user sees options to retry, edit, or
remove the failing item.

C\) Details Step

Talent panel

Package chosen, addons, price; travel fee calc (zone or permile beyond
included radius), schedule, location (approx).

Instant Book chip if applicable; otherwise "Request to Book" label with
expected response window.

Studio panel

Date/time & min hours check; hourly calc + cleaning fee (if set);
deposit hold badge with amount; rules summary.

Conflicts & validation

Live revalidation of availability for both panels before continuing.

If collision or minhours violation, inline error + suggested
alternatives (nearby time slots, similar studios).

Group time sync enforced: studio duration must cover talent time (+
configured buffer).

D\) Smart Docs Step (esign before pay)

Autoassembled packs (prefilled from booking context):

Talent: SOW, License, Model Release (if needed), Cancellation policy
summary.

Studio: Property/Space Release, House Rules, Safety Addendum
(autoincluded if hazards toggled), Studio cancellation terms.

Esign required to proceed (oneclick signer sheet per doc; audit trail
stored).

Amendments: if details change later (reschedule/adjustments), amended
docs generate automatically and require reack.

Address privacy: Studio's exact address unlocks after confirmation;
shown in thread + ics attachments.
