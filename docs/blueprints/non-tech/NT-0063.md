Less friction, more bookings: sellers launch fast, quote faster, and
close with clarity.

Fewer disputes: standardized packages + Smart Docs + Delivery Room
manifests turn "hesaid/shesaid" into objective checks.

Costs under control: originals stay in sellers' cloud; we store only
previews + manifests; no surprise infra bills.
