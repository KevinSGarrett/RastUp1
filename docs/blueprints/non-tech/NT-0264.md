• Training: quarterly refreshers for T&S, Support, Finance; FCRA basics;
chargeback representment; accessibility etiquette.\
• Measurement: we track leading/lagging indicators to tune thresholds
and staffing.

Implementation Notes:\
• Feature Flags & City Gates: externally visible policy toggles ship
behind flags; Admin can rollback with a two‑step confirmation; events
are audited.\
• Admin Operability: every rule has a corresponding tool in Admin
(approve/deny/redact/pause/escalate) with immutable logs.\
• Evidence Hygiene: store hashes and immutable links; redact PII in
views; never edit originals; legal holds override deletion where
applicable.\
• Copy Clarity: explain outcomes and next steps; avoid citing laws in
emails; link to help‑center with examples.\
• Training: quarterly refreshers for T&S, Support, Finance; FCRA basics;

Context & Alignment: We are launching a US‑only creative marketplace
focused on models, photographers, videographers, and content creators.\
We have chosen a subscription‑free go‑to‑market with monetization via
take‑rate and optional, usage‑based promotions that are
eligibility‑gated and capped.\
Public content is artistic‑nudity‑only; Safe‑Mode defaults for guests
apply. Deliverables are transferred via external storage (Drive/Dropbox)
with immutable manifests.\
Payments flow through card (3DS where required) and ACH (with a
buyer‑fee discount); funds are escrowed and released on acceptance.\
Instant Book is gated by ID verification; background checks are opt‑in
(Trusted Pro). Feature flags and city gates are used for reversible,
auditable launches.\
Admin consoles enable Support, Trust & Safety, Finance, and Ops to
perform routine tasks without code changes.

Goals:\
• Offer optional background checks (Trusted Pro) that enhance safety
without becoming a barrier to entry.\
• Implement FCRA‑compliant flows for consent, notices, disputes, and
adverse action.\
• Protect privacy and prevent misuse of background data.

Scope & Applicability:\
Applies to providers who opt into the Trusted Pro program and to buyers
where a studio or brand requires checks for on‑premise work. Background
checks are not mandatory to browse or book unless specified by a
studio's house rules.

Definitions (plain language):\
• Background Check: a consumer report from a screening vendor provided
with the provider's written authorization.\
• Pre‑Adverse Action Notice: a notice sent when we might take an action
based in whole or part on the report.\
• Adverse Action Notice: a final notice if action is taken (e.g.,
denying Trusted Pro badge).\
• Permissible Purpose: the reason we may request a report (safety for
marketplace participation).

Policy Statements:\
• Consent: explicit, informed, written consent is required; separate
from ToS; withdrawable at any time.\
• Scope: limited to identity verification, criminal records where
lawful, and sex offender registries; no credit checks for creators.\
• Use: report is used solely to grant or deny Trusted Pro; not for
unrelated decisions; no sharing with other users.\
• Adverse action: if considering a negative decision, send pre‑adverse
notice with report copy and rights; wait required period before final
decision.\
• Disputes: if user disputes accuracy, pause action until vendor
resolves; document outcomes; re‑e
