all
eligible paid impressions/day (prevents domination).

Organic share guardrail (platformwide): at least 85--90% of buyer result
clicks must land on organic cards in the pilot (monitored KPI).

Roundrobin within caps: if eligible \> slots, rotate weighted by
(remaining budget × QualityScore).

F\) Provider Experience (setup → proof of value)

Setup flow: pick service profile → choose Search Boost or Featured → set
budget & bid → (optional) narrow targeting → confirm.

Creative policy: no custom ads; we use the profile card + system ribbon
(prevents deceptive creative).

Guidance: "Suggested bid" and "expected clicks/bookings" estimates;
"Improve QualityScore" checklist (ID verify, reduce response time,
enable Instant Book, adjust price fit).

Reporting (realtime): impressions, clicks, CTR, avg CPC, inquiries,
bookings, GMV attributed, ROAS, and incremental lift via a 10% holdout
(eligible but not shown).

Autocoaching: if 7day ROAS \< 1.5×, show "Consider pausing or improving
QS" prompt; if \<1.0× after 14 days, recommend pause.

G\) Buyer Experience (clarity & control)

Labeling: Promoted chip + info tooltip ("Matches your filters; purchased
limited promotion. Promoted never outranks more relevant results.")

Controls: Hide this provider (suppresses organic & paid for 30 days),
Report (routes to Safety).

Consistency: paid units respect NSFW settings and all filters; density
caps enforced above.

H\) Fraud, Safety & Abuse Controls

Invalid click detection: rapid repeats, zerodwell bounces, bot/device
anomalies, selfclicking, rings → automark invalid & credit back CPC;
repeated anomalies throttle delivery & flag for review.

Misrepresentation: price/availability mismatches or baitandswitch →
autopause campaign + warning; repeat → suspension.

Safety linkage: any active safety investigation → suppress all paid
delivery until cleared.

Budget protection: daily overspend guard (≤5% variance) + autocredit on
pacing errors. Chargeback shield: new campaigns disabled if unresolved
chargebacks.

I\) Launch Posture & Comms (Houston pilot)

Access: inviteonly cohort of 100--200 eligible providers per role in
Houston for first 6--8 weeks.

Messaging to community: publish an Integrity Pledge (fairfirst, clear
labels, hard caps, eligibility gates).

Feedback loop: inproduct survey after 2 weeks of spend; provider & buyer
focus groups at week 4; adjust caps/floors accordingly.

Reinvestment: earmark 20--30% of pilot Boost revenue to buyer
acquisition in Houston (drives net liquidity).

J\) KPIs & "Kill Switch" Thresholds (first 60--90 days)

Adoption & performance

≥ 12--18% of eligible providers try Boost; Featured weekly slot fill
≥60%.

Median ROAS ≥ 2.5×; median costperbooking ≤ \$18 (TierA).

Buyer experience & trust

Organic click share ≥ 85--90% (guardrail).

Buyer Hide rate ≤ 3% of paid impressions; Safety reports ≤ 0.2 / 1,000
paid impressions.

No significant drop in search→inquiry or inquiry→booking vs. prepilot
baselines.

Fairness & ecosystem health

Gini index of paid impression distribution stays below threshold (no
provider monopolies).

Nonboosted, highRep providers maintain stable inquiry rates (±10%).

Kill switch (autopause) if any occur:

Organic click share \< 80% for 7 rolling days; or

Buyer Hide rate \> 5% for 7 days; or

Incremental bookings (holdout) ≤ 0 for 2 consecutive weeks; or

Spike in safety reports tied to promoted cards.

K\) Pricing Governance & City Tiers

City tiers: TierA (Houston, Dallas, LA, NYC, ATL) → TierB (growing
metros) → TierC (smaller metros).

CPC floors review: monthly; adjust ±\$0.10--\$0.20 based on fill,
provider ROAS, and buyer CTR/conv.

Featured pricing review: quarterly by impressions delivered, CTR,
bookings/slot.

L\) What we won't do (explicit guardrails)

No boosting of proposals/RFP response order or message thread
prominence.

No "unverified" or lowRep accounts in paid slots.

No unlabeled or disguised ads.

No auction in v1 (simplicity first); we may test a hybrid bid × QS
