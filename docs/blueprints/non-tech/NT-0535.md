• Ethics & Brand Safety: Decline partners whose practices conflict with
user safety or our policy posture; include an ethics review in intake.

Implementation Notes:\
• Partner Governance: Maintain a single source of truth for partner
status (prospect, NDA, pilot, GA), contacts, contracts, scopes, and
SLAs. Tag all features behind partner flags and city gates to avoid
blast‑radius mistakes. • Privacy & Data: Apply least‑data
principles---only request scopes needed for the user value; rotate
tokens; revoke access on inactivity. • Security & Audits: Vendor
SOC/pentest reports stored with expiry reminders; incident bridges
pre‑arranged for Sev‑1/Sev‑0. • Co‑Marketing Discipline: Announce after
pilots prove value; enforce clear success metrics; align PR/brand tone
with our artistic‑only policy. • Support & Playbooks: Create
partner‑specific macros; train Support/Trust on integration quirks; log
incidents with partner tags. • Measurement: Attribute partner impact in
§5 dashboards (e.g., ACH share by vendor, IDV completion rate by
provider, studio attach from verified partners). • Contracts: Avoid
exclusivity unless compensated; require termination rights, data
return/delete clauses, and uptime credits for SLA misses. • City
Sequencing: Some partners launch in founding cities only; we gate by
city to manage operational readiness. • Accessibility & Inclusion:
Ensure partner widgets meet WCAG 2.1 AA; provide text alternatives and
keyboard navigation.\
• Ethics & Brand Safety: Decline partners whose practices conflict with
user safety or our policy posture; include an ethics review in intake.

Partnerships Disclaimer: This is an internal planning document for
partner strategy and ecosystem development. It does not create
commitments. All integrations ship behind flags, follow privacy
policies, and require vendor due diligence, DPAs, SLAs, and legal
review. Commercial terms are illustrative until negotiated.

Context & Alignment: US‑only marketplace at launch; subscription‑free;
monetization via take‑rate and capped, eligibility‑gated usage‑based
promotions. Public content is artistic‑only with Safe‑Mode on for
guests. Deliverables flow via external links (Drive/Dropbox) with
immutable manifests; escrow releases on acceptance. Instant Book is
gated by ID verification; background checks are opt‑in (Trusted Pro).
Rollouts are city‑gated behind feature flags; Admin Console enforces
least‑privilege, JIT elevation, two‑person approvals, immutable audits,
and kill‑switches.

Goals:\
• Seed supply and cultivate best practices via education channels that
replenish the marketplace.\
• Offer safety training, portfolio reviews, and city meetups that build
trust and loyalty.

Target partner segments:\
• University photo/video programs; community colleges; trade schools;
creator clubs; camera stores; meetup groups.

Mutual value proposition:\
• Students and emerging creators get paid experience and safety
scaffolds; schools get career outcomes.\
• We gain verified, trained supply and grassroots co‑marketing.

Selection criteria & due diligence:\
• Program legitimacy; faculty champions; safety posture; willingness to
co‑host trainings and meetups.

Integration scopes & surfaces (what we build):\
• Campus workshops: Safe‑Mode, deliverables manifest, contracts,
reputation; co‑hosted creator days in partner studios.\
• Referral codes; verified badges for program participants (non‑monetary
recognition).

Commercial & legal patterns (illustrative):\
• Non‑financial in most cases; mutual promotion; event co‑sponsorship;
limited grants for founding programs.

Enablement & co‑marketing (how we launch together):\
• Campus starter kit; deck and curriculum; checklist for faculty; event
playbook; creator ambassador program.

Top risks & mitigations:\
• Overhead vs. ROI; policy mis
