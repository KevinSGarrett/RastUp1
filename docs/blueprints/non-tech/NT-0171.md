J\) Acceptance Criteria (mark §5.6 FINAL)

Metrics Catalog created with owners, grains, definitions, tests, and
semver.

Semantic layer exposes curated measures/dims, blocks unsafe joins,
recomputes ratios correctly, and masks PII.

Core keys live: gmv_cents, platform_revenue_cents, take_rate_pct,
bookings_count, cancellations_rate, acceptance_rate_pct,
search_to_inquiry_pct, inquiry_to_booking_pct, on_time_delivery_pct,
safety_reports_per_1k, payout_latency_median_days, promo_spend_cents,
cpb_cents, roas, roas_incremental, rep_decile_share,
tax_collected_cents.

Tests & freshness badges wired to §4.14.12; definition hash shown on
tiles.

Versioning and deprecation documented; CI blocks metric edits without
owner approval.

K\) Why this works

One language for money, growth, and safety reduces debate and
accelerates decisions.

The semantic layer prevents subtle errors (double counts, bad ratios,
PII leaks).

Versioning & tests let us evolve definitions without breaking
dashboards.

§5.7 --- Privacy, PII & Retention

Goal: Keep user data private, minimal, and auditable while still
powering analytics, payouts, safety, and growth. Enforce strict
separation of raw PII, short retentions on noisy logs, and clear unmask
workflows with timeboxed approvals. All choices align with USonly launch
and decisions in §4.12--§4.14 & §5.0--§5.6.

A\) Scope & Principles

USonly data residency at launch; all primary storage and backups in US
regions.

Minimize & mask: Capture the least necessary; store tokens instead of
raw identifiers; mask by default.

Purposebound: Use data only for defined product/ops purposes; anything
else needs Legal signoff.

Defense in depth: Contracts (§5.1) + vault isolation (§5.4) + RBAC
(§4.14.1) + retention (§4.14.15) + DLP scans.

No minors: Platform is 18+. KYC/ID returns an "18+ verified" flag; we do
not keep DOB in analytics layers.

B\) Data Classification (privacy tiers)

Rule: Raw emails/phones/addresses/SSNs are never in events or Gold. Only
tokens & IDs flow through analytics.

C\) PII Handling Patterns

Tokenization at ingest (edge collector):

Email → email_token (salted hash + surrogate key).

Phone → phone_token.

Address → address_token (if needed for payouts).

Tokens are irreversible outside the vault.

Vault_PII (separate schema & keys):

Tables: vault_pii.user_contact, vault_pii.tax_forms,
vault_pii.background_artifacts.

Columnlevel encryption (KMS), access only to Legal/Tax under RBAC + JIT
elevation.

Unmask flow (operational necessity only):

Admin requests JustInTime elevation with reason + case/ticket (§4.14.1).

Timeboxed key to run a scoped unmask function (e.g., contact a user for
payouts/chargeback).

Twoperson approval for tax/background artifacts and bulk unmask.

All accesses logged in a PII access ledger with user, reason, columns,
counts.

Masking in UI/exports:

Masked by default (j\*\*\*@mail.com, (\*\*\*) \*\*\*1234).

All CSV/PDF exports watermarked with requester, timestamp, definition
hash, and query id.

D\) Access Control & Environments

RBAC by role & scope (see §4.14.1).

Rowlevel security for contractors by city_id if needed.

Separate SSO realms for Sandbox vs Prod (see §4.14.16).

Notebook policy: Analysts use gold_restricted via the semantic layer; no
direct vault access.

E\) Consent, Notices & Purpose Limitation

Clickwrap logs (ToS/Privacy) with version, IP/device, and timestamp (see
§4.14.15 G).

Edelivery consent for tax forms stored in vault; indicator mirrored in
Gold (edelivery_consent=true).
