ext loss.

Outcome clarity upfront: Show a refund/charge preview based on policy
matrix and timestamps before submission.

Evidence beats rhetoric: Autoattach Smart Docs, Delivery manifests,
checkin/out, calendar logs, studio access logs, and payment lines.

Separate ledgers: Talent and Studio bookings are independent; LBG shows
a single summary with perbooking outcomes.

Timers & SLAs: Access issues are P1; standard disputes follow strict
windows (24h/48h/5day).

Chargebackready: Every case builds a representment pack by default.

SFW & privacy: No explicit media; exact studio address hidden except to
parties; Safe Mode respected in notifications.

B\) Entry Points & Routes

Thread shortcut: Inthread ▸ Get help (contextual forms)

Profile menu: Support Center /support → lists bookings + cases

Booking detail: Open a case button

Admin: Support Console /admin/support (agentonly)

C\) Case Types (policyaware, minimal)

Talent bookings

Refund request -- cancellation (buyerinitiated; applies §3.9 talent
matrix)

Nondelivery / missing items (compare SOW vs manifest)

Offspec quality (autochecks vs SOW; may route to revision first)

Noshow / late arrival (uses checkin/out evidence)

Payment correction (duplicate charge, tax error)

Studio bookings

Access issue (live) → P1 (badge); resolves or refunds per §3.9 addendum

Damage claim (hostinitiated; deposit hold)

Postbooking adjustment (overtime, crew overage, rule violation)

Amenity misrepresentation (partial refund if material)

Payment correction

Linked Booking Group (LBG)

Group cancel/split (compute separate outcomes; show one summary)

Group reschedule (sync both bookings or split)

Mixed dispute (e.g., Talent deliverables issue + Studio OK)

D\) SelfServe Triage Wizard (all flows)

Step 1 --- Identify issue

Contextaware options (e.g., "Access code not working" on Studio;
"Delivered fewer images than contracted" on Talent).

Step 2 --- Policy preview

Show matrix snippet (e.g., "\>7d=100%, 7--48h=50%, \<48h=0%"), countdown
timers, and estimated outcomes (refund lines per booking, buyer fee
policy, deposit note).

If outcome is clearly \$0, offer "Contact seller/host" instead of
filing.

Step 3 --- Evidence (auto + user)

Autoattached: checkin/out (Studio), SOW/License/House Rules, Delivery
manifest, Autochecks, messages timeline, price lines, deposit
configuration, access logs (if integrated).

User prompts: upload photos/video (SFW), describe discrepancy; link to
UGC post when relevant.

Step 4 --- Review & submit

Show refund/charge preview with taxes/fees; LBG outcome split if group;
submit → case created.

Confirmation

Thread posts a system message summarizing the case; both parties get
actions (Respond / Add evidence).

E\) Evidence & Calculations (what the engine uses)

Talent: SOW (deliverables count/spec), Delivery manifest
(filenames/checksums), Autochecks (resolution, codecs), acceptance
timestamps, revision rounds used, messages referencing scope.

Studio: checkin/out geofence pass/fail, House Rules signatures, access
logs, pre/post photos, schedule vs booked, crew count note, hazard
toggles & Safety Addendum.

Financials: escrow amounts, provider fee, buyer fee, tax lines, deposit
authorization, promotions/discounts.

Outcome logic: applies matrices from §3.9; refund buyer fee only on
provider/hostfault or safety exceptions; deposit captures no platform
fee (per §3.1 addendum).

F\) Case Lifecycle & States

Open (awaiting counterparty) --- autodeadline set (48h respond).

Evidence needed --- requester must add missing items (48h).

Proposed resolution --- party has 48h to accept/decline.

Neutral Review --- agent evaluates evidence; target decision ≤ 5
business days.

Resolved --- refund/charge issued; receipts & amended docs generated.

Closed --- telemetry logged; affects Reputation and future eligibility
(IB/boosts).

Fastlane closures

Access failure (host fault) → immediate refund of Studio; buyer fee
waived; goodwill credit optional.
