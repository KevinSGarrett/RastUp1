Space Listing (Listing Type) --- a place-based offering the account can
own: Studio.

When verified via the light process in §3.4, it displays the Verified
Studio badge.

Key distinction: Studios are listings, not roles. Service Profiles
represent people; Studio represents a rentable space.

B\) Relationships (what can link to what)

An Account may own 0..N Service Profiles and 0..N Studio listings.

Linking (optional): A Service Profile may link one of the Account's
Studio listings (e.g., a photographer links their cyclorama).

Result: the Service Profile shows a "Owns/Has Studio" chip; the linked
Studio's detail page shows "Hosted by {Profile}".

Independence: Studios can exist without any Service Profile (e.g., host
who only rents space).

C\) Classification & Surfaces

Public categories (highlevel):

People (roles): Model / Photographer / Videographer / Creator /
FanSubscription Creator

Places (listings): Studio

Search role selector (later detailed in §4.1/§1.2) includes Studio
alongside People roles.

Profiles vs Listings:

Service Profile page = person's offering + booking widget.

Studio Listing page = space details + hourly booking widget.\
(UX/page map specifics belong to §4.0/§4.1; this addendum only defines
the entities.)

D\) Reviews, Reputation & Policies (alignment only)

Reviews & scores are typescoped:

Service Profiles accrue rolespecific reviews.

Studios accrue spacespecific reviews.

Reputation Score is computed separately for Service Profiles vs Studios
(consumed by ranking later).

Policies: Talent bookings follow talent matrices; Studio bookings follow
studio matrices (per §3.9/Studio addendum). (This addendum only records
that they are distinct.)

E\) Verification & Gating (entitylevel)

Service Profiles: ID → Instant Book; Background → Trusted Pro
(unchanged).

Studios: Studio Lite verification (address/doc check) → Verified Studio
badge; Instant Book may require verification (policy in §3.4).

Safe Mode: applies to people profiles with 18+ settings; Studios are not
gated by Safe Mode.

F\) Data Model (nontechnical description)

ServiceProfile: role_type, role_fields (varies by role),
verification_status (ID, BG), reputation metrics.

StudioListing: listing_type=studio, studio_fields (address neighborhood,
capacity, amenities), verification_status (unverified \| lite_verified),
reputation metrics.

Link: optional association from ServiceProfile → StudioListing for
"owns/has studio" chip.

Booking: distinct booking objects for Service vs Studio; can be Linked
at checkout (see §1.3/§4.0 later).

G\) Acceptance Criteria (to mark §1.1 addendum FINAL)

Studios defined as Space Listings, distinct from Service Profiles
(roles).

Account may own multiple Service Profiles and Studio listings.

Linking from a Service Profile to an owned Studio is supported (for
crosssurfacing chips only; no coupling of reviews).

Review/Rep separation: Service reviews remain rolescoped; Studio reviews
are spacescoped.

Verification: Studio uses Studio Lite → Verified Studio badge; Service
verification unchanged.

Policy separation acknowledged: talent vs studio matrices handled in
their own sections.

H\) Why this works

Clarity: People (roles) vs Places (studios) eliminates ambiguity in
search, reviews, and policies.

Scalability: One account can grow horizontally (new roles) and
vertically (add studio listings) without schema contortions.

Low coupling: Linking is optional and displayonly, preserving clean
ownership and independent

SubSection 1.2 --- RoleSpecific Data & Advanced Search

1\) Design Goal

Make search pinpoint and commercially relevant (not gear-nerdy), so a
buyer can quickly find the exact look, reach, budget fit, availability,
and reliability they need---then book in a few clicks.

2\) Global Search UX (CategoryFirst)

Step 1 (Required): User selects a Role to search: Models / Photographers
/ Videographers / Creators.

Step 2: Search bar accepts keywords; Advanced Filters change per role.
