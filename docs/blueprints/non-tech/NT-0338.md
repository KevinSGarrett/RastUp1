§9.6 --- Sensitivity Analysis (Fees, ACH, Promotions, Studios,
Cancellations)

Financial Modeling Disclaimer: This section provides planning
assumptions, formulas, and structures for internal modeling. It is not a
forecast or financial advice. All sample numbers are illustrative;
replace with real inputs once telemetry in §5 is live.

Context & Alignment: We operate a US‑only creative marketplace
connecting models, photographers, videographers, and content creators
with buyers and studios. Launch strategy is subscription‑free;
monetization is via take‑rate on bookings and usage‑based promotions
(capped, labeled, eligibility‑gated). Public content is artistic‑only;
deliverables use external storage with immutable manifests. Instant Book
requires ID verification; background checks are opt‑in (Trusted Pro).
ACH reduces buyer fee to 3% where enabled. Feature flags and city gates
control rollout; admin tools and audits turn policy into software.

Goals:\
• Quantify how small changes in key inputs move contribution margin and
runway.\
• Prioritize levers that we can influence (ACH adoption, promotions
ROAS, cancellation policy).\
• Expose hidden convexities (e.g., chargebacks) early.

Key variables & baselines:\
• Levers: Provider fee floors; buyer fee ACH discount; promotions
adoption and CPC floors; studio attach; cancellation policy bands.\
• Friction terms: Chargeback rates; dispute win rate; tax engine
latency; moderation load; ACH returns.

Core formulas (structure; plug real telemetry later):\
• ΔContribution = ∂(Revenue − COGS)/∂x × Δx, evaluated at Base scenario\
• Elasticity_ROAS = ∂GMV_incremental/∂CPC / CPC\
• ACH_effect = (ΔBuyerFee − ΔProcessorCost) at Δ(ACH share)

ACH lever:\
Higher ACH share reduces processor cost and buyer fee revenue; net
effect often positive due to cost savings and buyer conversion lift.

Promotions lever:\
Promotions revenue matters only if ROAS≥2.5× and invalid‑click credits
are low; we control CPC floors and density caps city‑by‑city.

Cancellation policy:\
Tighter late‑cancel penalties reduce waste but may reduce demand;
measure rebooking offsets and reputation effects.

Instrumentation & success metrics:\
• Tornado chart of contribution drivers; ACH net effect; promotions
incremental GMV; cancellation impact on net revenue\
• Studio attach rate and deposit claim rates; effect on GMV and support
costs

Top risks & mitigations:\
• Over‑tuning to early data → require confidence intervals; avoid noisy
toggling\
• Hidden correlations → run multifactor analyses; keep experiments
orthogonal where possible

Acceptance checklist:\
□ Sensitivity dashboard live; drivers ranked by impact and
controllability.\
□ Levers with high impact assigned owners and experiments.\
□ Guardrails set for fee and CPC floor changes per city.

Modeling Deep‑Dive:\
• Scenario setup: Define a city cohort with starting supply and demand,
apply search→inquiry and inquiry→booking rates from §6.2/§6.3, then
layer on cancellations, lateness, and chargebacks. Compute GMV per
cohort and pass it through fee structure, taxes, and processor costs.\
• Unit economics: For a representative \$X booking, compute provider fee
(12%), buyer fee (5% or 3% with ACH), and processing cost. Show platform
net before variable ops (content safety scans, IDV/BG subsidies). Repeat
for small (≤\$150), mid (\$300--\$600), and large (\>\$1,000) bookings.\
• Promotions ROI: Using holdouts, estimate incremental GMV from paid
exposure. Attribute revenue to promotions net of invalid‑click credits.
Ensure quality score and eligibility keep paid from cannibalizing
organic relevance.\
• Sensitivity toggles: Vary ACH adoption (10--40%), chargebacks
(0.2--0.6%), cancellations (3--10%), and promotions adoption (5--25%) to
see contribution margin swings.\
• City expansion: Add a second city with a 3--6 month lag. Reuse
maturation curves and observe shared services leverage (support, SRE).
