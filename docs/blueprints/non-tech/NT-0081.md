M\) Acceptance Criteria (mark 4.1 FINAL)

Desktop header implements Browse, Search, Context link
(Boards/Packages/Studios), Messages, Notifications, Create, Safe Mode,
City, Account with Profile switcher.

Mobile tab bar implements Home, Search, Create, Messages, Profile;
overflow contains Boards, Notifications, Verification, Payments,
Settings, Help.

Role/Listing selector in Search includes
Model/Photographer/Videographer/Creator/FanSub Creator/Studio with
People vs Places divider; filters drawers reflect rolespecific vs
studiospecific fields.

Attach a Studio pill appears only when a People search has date/time;
opens a prefiltered Studio drawer; selected studio persists to Linked
Booking Group checkout.

Safe Mode default ON; hides FanSub Creator and nuditybeyondLingerie for
People; does not hide Studios; email/push remain 18+safe.

Context switching works: Profile switcher (roles + host), header context
link (Boards/Packages/Studios), Create menu adapts to persona.

Crosslinks: People↔Studio chips; Invite from profile; Board shortcuts;
Case Study deep links.

Header context bar shows active chips and supports Save/Edit/Clear; LBG
shows twochip summary.

Auth walls and error states follow the documented patterns;
accessibility, i18n, and performance budgets enforced.

All telemetry events above are emitted for
nav/search/safemode/create/context interactions.

N\) Why this IA works

People vs Places clarity: Users always know whether they're looking at a
person or a space, yet can combine them fluidly via AttachinFlow.

Contextual creation: The Create menu and the context link reduce
cognitive load for multirole/host users.

Safety & brand protection: Safe Mode is omnipresent and conservative by
default; studios stay visible but SFW.

Scalable: Adds cities, roles, or more studio inventory without changing
the mental model.

Fast paths: Crosslinks and sticky action bars trim steps from discovery
to booking.

§4.2 --- Global Components & Design System

Goal: Ship a coherent, performant, accessible component library that
makes every flow in §4.0/§4.1 consistent and fast to build. Components
are role/spaceaware, SafeModeaware, cityaware, and optimized for
mobilefirst. Everything here is implementationagnostic (works whether
you use React/Vue/etc.).

A\) Design Foundations (tokens)

Color (semantic):

Primary (actions): \--primary-600, hover -700, focus ring -300

Neutral (text/ui): \--neutral-900/700/500/300/100

Accent (info): \--info-600

Success: \--success-600

Warning: \--warning-600

Danger: \--danger-600

Verification (badges): \--verify-600

Promoted (labels): \--promo-600 (used only for the "Promoted" chip)

Type ramp:

Display, H1--H6, Body L/M/S, Caption, Mono (numbers). Use rem with
1.6--1.8 lineheight for body.

Numerals: tabular for prices, ratings, reputation rings.

Spacing & radii:

Spacing scale: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 40

Radius scale: 4, 8, 12 (cards/buttons), 999 (pills/chips)

Elevation: Card (1), Popover (2), Drawer (3), Modal (4)

Breakpoints:

XS \<480, SM \<768, MD \<1024, LG \<1440, XL ≥1440

Motion (reducemotion friendly):

Duration: 120--200ms (hover), 200--300ms (modals/drawers)

Easing: standard cubicbezier; respect prefersreducedmotion.

Icons (consistent set):

Roles (Model/Photographer/Videographer/Creator/FanSub), Studio, Instant
Book (⚡), Verified (✔︎), Trusted Pro (shield), Safe Mode (shield18),
Social (IG/YT/TT/X), Amenities (sun, cyc, blackout, height, parking,
makeup, grip, sound), Hazards (strobe, haze, flame, ladder).

B\) Layout Patterns

Page shell: Sticky header; 12column grid at MD+; single column at SM.
Side drawer for filters on desktop; fullscreen on mobile.

Sticky bars: Search (Filters/Save), Profile/Studio (Book/Request),
Checkout (Pay & Confirm).

Cards first: All lists (search, boards, invites) render cards with
consistent skeletons.
