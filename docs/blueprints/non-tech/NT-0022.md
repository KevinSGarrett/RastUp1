M\) Acceptance Criteria (mark §1.3 addendum FINAL)

Two booking types implemented; Linked Booking Group supported in
checkout, thread, and receipts.

Studio checkout includes hourly pricing, min hours, cleaning fee, rules
& access, Property/Space Release esign, and deposit hold.

Instant Book for studios with optional "approval required"; guardrails
for verification.

Reschedule proposes synchronized changes; buyer can split or cancel with
pertype policies applied.

Checkin/out geofenced for studios; overtime & overage adjustments flow
live with evidence & timers.

Damage deposit lifecycle (authorize → claim window → capture/deny →
release) implemented.

Completion & payouts follow pertype triggers; Early Payout (peruse)
eligible for highrep accounts.

Receipts/invoices show separate lines & policies; tax handling surfaced;
Smart Docs downloadable.

Edge cases handled (doublebooking, access failure, early exit, travel
fees talentonly).

Analytics events instrumented.

N\) Why this works

Clarity & fairness: Separate bookings keep policies, disputes, and
payouts clean---no crosscontamination.

Low friction: Instant Book + deposit holds match studio norms while
escrow preserves trust.

Group convenience: Linked groups let buyers plan shoots endtoend with
predictable outcomes if plans change.

Operationally sane: Evidencebased adjustments and timeboxed claims keep
support scalable.

SubSection 1.4 --- Messaging, Inbox & Collaboration UX

Goal: Make communication effortless and professional from first contact
through final delivery. Keep everything in one place, roleaware, and
bookingaware to cut backandforth, prevent misunderstandings, and
increase completed bookings.

A\) Principles

Roleaware & Bookingaware: Every conversation is clearly tied to a role
(Service Profile) and, when applicable, a specific booking.

Single source of truth: Chat, briefs, shot lists, files, contracts,
location, schedule, extras, and payments live inside the thread/project.

Fast & respectful: Read receipts, quick replies, templates, and
structured forms reduce friction and ambiguity.

Safety first: Prominent tools to report, block, escalate, and check in;
privacy by default.

Anticircumvention: Keep the value onplatform (escrow, protection,
reviews), while being transparent and fair.
