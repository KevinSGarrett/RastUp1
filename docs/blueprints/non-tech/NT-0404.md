ds, the city GM or Risk DRI chairs the review;
actions have due dates. • We prefer reversible changes (flags) and
narrow blast radius (city gates). • We avoid \'security by obscurity\';
we publish clear user guidance, train staff, and keep audit trails for
all sensitive actions. • The risk register itself is versioned; changes
record rationale and observed metrics.

Risk & Process Disclaimer: This section is an internal risk‑management
blueprint. It does not constitute legal, tax, or security advice.
Coordinate with counsel and security leaders before externalizing any
policy or committing to obligations. All examples are illustrative and
must be adapted to the realities measured in Section 5 dashboards.

Context & Alignment: US‑only marketplace launch; subscription‑free
start; monetization via take‑rate and usage‑based promotions with strict
eligibility and caps. Public content is artistic‑only with Safe‑Mode
defaults for guests. Deliverables are exchanged via external links
(Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests; escrowed payments release on
acceptance. Instant Book requires ID verification; background checks are
opt‑in (Trusted Pro). Rollouts are city‑gated behind feature flags.
Admin Console enforces least‑privilege, JIT elevation, two‑person
approvals, and full audit trails.

Goals:\
• Identify user‑experience pitfalls that slow adoption or create
confusion.\
• Ensure multi‑role profiles, search filters, and booking flows remain
clear and fast.\
• Prevent scope creep and feature load that harms initial simplicity.

Risk statements (top of mind):\
• Multi‑role profile confusion causes poor discovery and low
conversion.\
• Over‑complex search overwhelms new buyers; defaults hide relevant
results.\
• Deliverables manifest flow is too heavy, causing drop‑offs and
disputes later.\
• Reschedule/Change Order UX leads to off‑platform renegotiations and
leakage.\
• Boards/following become noisy; feed devolves into spam; DM fatigue
increases.

Primary causes & contributing factors:\
• Insufficient labeling between roles; poor tabbing; mixed reviews
across roles.\
• Too many filters surfaced by default; lack of presets; unclear
tooltips.\
• Manifest requirements unclear; large file flows intimidating; external
links not well explained.\
• Change fees and time bands not visible; provider controls not
transparent.\
• No rate limits; weak relevance; missing foldering and muting controls.

Leading indicators & early warning signals:\
• High bounce on profile tabs; low click‑through to booking from role
pages.\
• Filter usage spikes with declining S→I; help‑center views for \'how to
search\'.\
• Abandoned \'Add deliverables\' step; disputes citing \'not as
described\'.\
• Change orders initiated off‑platform; refund tickets citing
confusion.\
• Hide/mute rates; follow churn; DM response time increases; spam
reports.

Preventive controls & mitigations:\
• Clear role tabs, separate reviews per role, cross‑linking;
role‑specific landing pages.\
• Beginner mode with presets; advanced filter drawer; definitions chips;
engagement sliders.\
• Lightweight manifest defaults + \'external link manifest\' explainer;
examples and templates.\
• Inline price math; protected change order flow; audit trail; lock
messaging until accepted.\
• Foldered follows; rate limits; mute; relevance tuning; \'quality bar\'
for feed posts.

Incident playbooks (summary):\
• Search simplification AB test; remove low‑value filters; increase
presets.\
• Deliverables tutorial video; acceptance window guidance; macro for
\'how manifests work\'.\
• DM spam spike: tighten sends; require IDV for outreach; adjust credits
per §3.2 launch spec.
