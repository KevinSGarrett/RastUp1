 applicable.

FCRA/EEOC: preadverse + adverse action for BG denials; individualized
assessment; appeal path.

Nondiscrimination: no targeting by protected class; policy + audits.

Marketplace role: verification conveys eligibility, not employment or
moral certification.

G\) Studio Verification --- MVP (what we do now vs later)

Do now (Lite): doc OCR + name/address match + geocode/Place check;
autoapprove if high confidence; manual on fails.

Don't do now: inperson inspections, insurance validation, complex
KYB---defer to Phase 2 for highvolume venues.

Booking UX: buyers can select a Verified Studio from a list; private
addresses masked until confirm; location verification optional at
checkout for private addresses ("Verify general area").

H\) Incentives (make trust feel rewarding)

ID Verified: Instant Book + +20 DM credits; minor search tiebreak on
equal matches.

Trusted Pro: fee --0.5%, RFP priority, \$15 Boost coupon (see §3.3),
badge on cards.

Studio Verified: filterable badge; "Studio" ribbon on cards; inclusion
in "Studios in \[City\]" carousel.

SocialVerified: perplatform chips and search filters; nightly trends on
profile.

I\) KPIs & Guardrails (first 90 days per city)

Adoption: ID ≥ 60% of active users; Trusted Pro ≥ 15% of active
providers; Studio Lite ≥ 10% of active studios.

Speed: median ID completion \< 2 min (selfserve); BG ≤ 48h (85%); Studio
Lite ≤ 24h (exceptions).

Conversion lift (vs. unverified): ID → +12--20% search→inquiry; Trusted
Pro → +10--15% inquiry→booking.

Dropoff: verificationstep abandonment \< 20%; if higher, simplify flow
or move trigger later.

Cost: monthly KYC spend within ±10% of budget cap; cost/verified flat to
down.

Kill switches: if search→inquiry or inquiry→booking drops \>10%
postgating in a cohort, relax triggers (e.g., gate at payout only) until
metrics recover.

J\) Pricing (simple & growthfriendly at launch)

ID Verification: \$0 to user (platformpaid) in founding cities.

Background Check (Trusted Pro): passthrough (e.g., \~\$25--\$35 avg),
with promo coupon in first 60 days.

Studio Lite: \$0 for first 200 per city; then \$19 (doc review).

Social OAuth: \$0.

Expedite (later): optional \$9 fast lane if demanded (postliquidity).

K\) Acceptance Criteria (mark 3.4 FINAL)

Milestonegated triggers wired (Instant Book, first payout, private
address, message caps).

Vendor integrations live (ID/liveness, BG, geocode), with
manualexception queue + SLAs.

Subsidy controls: percity KYC budget caps; throttle rules; ops
dashboards.

Attestationonly storage; consent & privacy notices; FCRA/appeals for BG.

Studio Lite OCR+geocode flow live; manual fallback; badge + search
filter.

Incentives: badges, fee nudge (Trusted Pro), DM boost, search tiebreaks
wired.

Metrics & kill switches: adoption, speed, dropoff, conversion lift, cost
per verified; autorelax triggers if growth impact detected.

L\) Why this works

Protects growth: No heavy checks at signup; verification happens when
users see the value (payouts, Instant Book).

Controls cost & ops load: Automation handles most verifications;
platform pays for the musthave checks only; tight budget caps.

Builds trust fast: Visible badges and small ranking nudges reward safe,
reliable behavior and raise booking confidence.

Scales cleanly: Studio Lite now; deeper inspections only when warranted.
Citylevel dials let us tune friction and spend.

Notes for PM/Eng handoff: keep triggers and budgets configurable per
city; log all verification events for audit; run monthly reviews on
pass/fail rates, exception causes, and dropoff to continuously trim
friction without compromising safety.

§3.5 --- Brand/Buyer Products (Briefs/RFPs, Shortlists, Concierge,
Delivery)

Goal: Buyers (brands, agencies, studios, solo creators) go from idea →
shortlist → booked → delivered fast, with clear scope, documents,
storagesane delivery, and verifiable outcomes---without subscriptions.
Everything stays fair (relevancefirst), safe (escrow + esign), and
