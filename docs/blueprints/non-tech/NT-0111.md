onsensitive codes), 1099
issuance logs, edelivery view events.

Data retention: retain W9 and 1099 records per federal/state
requirements; purge on schedule after statutory window.

Safe Mode: billing/tax emails never include explicit previews; receipts
show only SFW descriptions.

M\) Accessibility & Performance

Keyboardable forms; clear labels; ARIA for steppers/tables; highcontrast
charts.

TTI targets: \<2.0s for /billing; paginated tables with skeletons;
exports generated asynchronously with download links.

O\) Acceptance Criteria (mark 4.12 FINAL)

Billing Home snapshot tiles for upcoming charges, escrow, next payout,
wallet, tax status.

Payment Methods supports Card (3DS) & ACH, default selection, and
checkout integration with ACH fee reduction to 3% (when enabled).

Checkout calls tax engine with role/service, location, and price lines;
returns jurisdiction tax; receipts show tax line with jurisdiction
breakdown; nontaxable or nonnexus cases show \$0 with explanation.

Payouts page supports bank connect, reserve visibility, Early Payout
peruse, ledger & statements with perbooking breakdowns (role vs studio).

Receipts include single and LBG group formats; support amendments;
deposit authorizations shown distinctly.

Promotions Wallet shows Boost/Featured spend, credits, budgets; invalid
click credits itemized.

Tax Center: electronic W9 collection with esig, TIN match, payout block
until W9; edelivery consent; dynamic threshold banners; 1099 generation
& delivery (PDF download; mail fallback); annual summaries & exports.

Chargebacks & Deposits states visible to both sides; deposit captures
generate separate receipts (no platform fee).

Security/Compliance: TIN encryption at rest, RBAC, audit trails (tax
engine, W9 versions, 1099 issuance), IRScompliant eW9 & edelivery flows.

Accessibility/Performance targets met; Telemetry events fire as listed.

P\) Why this works

Compliant by design: Destinationbased tax with jurisdiction detail +
marketplace facilitator stance removes ambiguity and state risk.

Handsoff tax ops: Automated eW9, TIN match, and 1099
generation/edelivery put tax handling on autopilot with clear UX.

Transparent & trustworthy: Every receipt shows tax lines and
calculations; users can download forms and summaries easily.

Scales with us: Citybycity growth doesn't require rearchitecting
money/tax flows; we add states, not complexity.

§4.13 --- Verification Center UX

Goal: Make verification fast, private, and explainable---so good actors
unlock trust and distribution quickly, while risky behavior is filtered
early. Centralize all checks in one Verification Center, with clear
benefits, transparent progress, firm privacy controls, and compliant
workflows (ID, background, social metrics, studio).
