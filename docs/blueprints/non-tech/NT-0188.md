I\) Ethics & Policy

No protected attributes used for assignment or modeling.

Risk models flag only; no automated adverse actions (§5.11).

NSFW policy remains enforced in candidates; experiments cannot bypass
Safe Mode.

Informed UX: no "dark patterns" (e.g., fake scarcity); experiments may
vary copy but not materially mislead.

Data use: limited to platform improvement (see §5.7 Purpose Limitation).

J\) Telemetry (experiment events)

exp.assign (unit, experiment_key, variant)

exp.expose (surface, decision_point)

exp.guardrail.breach (metric_key, value, threshold)

exp.sequential.boundary.hit (stage)

exp.report.publish (exp_id, report_url, metric_hashes)

All events include definition_hash and catalog_version for metrics.

K\) Acceptance Criteria (mark §5.13 FINAL)

Assignment service with deterministic hashing, stratification, sticky
storage, and mutualexclusion sets.

Event schema for exp.assign/exp.expose live; exposures logged at
decision points.

Library of test designs: A/B, switchback, city geo tests, promotions
holdouts.

Prereg workflow in Admin; power calculator; templates; stop rules
configurable.

Guardrails wired (safety, economics, fairness) with autorollback to
control via feature flags.

Analysis jobs read Metrics Catalog via semantic layer; reports saved
with reproducible artifacts and definition hashes.

Sequential monitoring supported; multipletesting control applied to
families.

Interference mitigations (diversity caps, time FE, exclusivity);
documentation for attribution paths.

Telemetry & dashboards show experiment status, lifts, and guardrail
health.

L\) Why this works

Respects marketplace dynamics (interference, fairness) while giving us
clean causal reads.

Guardrails keep us from trading trust & economics for shortterm wins.

Results are auditable and reproducible---the same numbers anyone sees on
dashboards.

§6.1 --- Phase0 Foundations (T0 → T+30)

Goal: Ship an endtoend singleleg booking experience (search → profile →
request/Instant Book → escrow → chat → delivery link → release/accept →
payout) that's safe, auditable, and supportable---good enough for a
small private alpha in Houston (signups open nationwide). Everything is
featureflagged, USonly, with artisticnudityonly public media, card
payments + escrow, ID verification v1, Admin v1, and a basic daily
finance close.

A\) Scope (what's in vs out)

In (musthaves)

Accounts & Roles: multirole user with service profiles for Model /
Photographer / Videographer / Creator (max 3 profiles in Phase0).

Profiles & Portfolios: images + short video thumbnails;
tagging/approvals; SafeMode for public media.

Search v1: role, city/radius, availability window, price range, core
model attributes (height, hair color, categories), no social API filters
yet (selfreported fields allowed; labeled Unverified).

Packages & Pricing: provider sets packages, addons, licensing tiers;
travel fee rules (base radius, permile or flat zone).

Booking v1: request flow + Instant Book (for IDverified only), escrow on
accept/IB, scheduling with provider calendar.

Messaging v1: threaded chat + attachments (images/pdf); read receipts;
quoting a message into a changeorder request.

Change Orders & Reschedule v1: provider can propose time/price edits;
buyer approves → escrow adjusts; audit trail (see §1.4 addendum).

Cancellation & Refund Policy Engine v1: roleaware, timebanded rules;
automatic fee math and receipts.

Deliverables via External Links: Google Drive/Dropbox manifest capture
(name, size, checksum, link, timestamp) + Accept/NeedsChanges + final
Accept.

ID Verification v1: hosted KYC; ID Verified gate unlocks Instant Book
and minor search nudge; background checks optout (Phase1).

Payments: card (3DS where required), single currency USD; escrow; payout
48h postcompletion; reserves for first payouts.

Receipts & Finance Close v0: singleleg receipts, amended receipts on
changes/refunds, basic daily close (no multicity tax complexi
