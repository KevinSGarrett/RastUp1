te via allowlist;
message users; reconcile nightly.

Acceptance Criteria (Go/No‑Go):\
✓ 14 consecutive days of green daily close; variance within tolerance.\
✓ End‑to‑end test scenarios pass for both legs (talent and studio when
enabled).\
✓ Chargeback kit demonstrably complete; templates published.

Scenario Playbook --- Tax engine partial outage:\
Trigger: Quote failures \> threshold\
Response: Enable allowlist bypass for affected states; banner copy at
checkout; capture order with pending tax.\
Roll‑back/Forward: Re‑quote and amend receipts post‑outage; notify
users.\
Owner: Tax PM \| Telemetry: tax_quote_latency, tax_quote_error_rate \|
User Copy: "We're calculating taxes after checkout due to a temporary
issue---you'll receive an updated receipt."

Scenario Playbook --- Payout queue stuck:\
Trigger: No payouts \'Sent\' in last 2 hours with pending items\
Response: Pause new payouts; investigate webhook backlog; trigger manual
retries; communicate on payouts page.\
Roll‑back/Forward: Resume queue; audit duplicate guards.\
Owner: Payments Eng \| Telemetry: payout_status_counts, webhook_lag \|
User Copy: "Your payout is delayed while we process a queue issue. No
action is required."

Implementation Notes:\
• Flags & City Gates: Every user‑visible change ships behind a flag with
a documented blast radius, an owner, and a rollback plan. City
allowlists prevent accidental national exposure. Admin has kill‑switches
for money and safety features with two‑person approval.\
• Admin Operability: No checklist is \'done\' unless Support can resolve
the top 3 edge cases without engineering and Trust can perform required
actions with an audit trail.\
• Help‑Center Alignment: All user‑facing copy is mirrored in the help
center with last‑updated dates and visual examples. We avoid legal
jargon; we explain outcomes and next steps.\
• QA Strategy: We prefer production‑like staging with seeded data and
synthetic bookings. We test under simulated load, outage, and edge cases
(ACH returns, 3DS failures, moderation queue spikes).\
• Holdouts & Experiments: Promotions, ranking, and any economic nudges
run with control cells and pre‑registered guardrails. We pause
experiments when guardrails breach.\
• Close‑the‑Loop: Post‑launch, we hold 7/30/90‑day reviews that tie
metrics to actions and retire ineffective steps.
