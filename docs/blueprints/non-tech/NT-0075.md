ation: review.submit, rep.update, strike.add/remove.

Studios: studio.create/publish/verify_lite,
studio.deposit.authorize/capture/release,
studio.adjustment.open/resolve.

Promotions: boost.purchase, featured.book.

Support: dispute.open/resolve, chargeback.open/represent.

All events include role_or_listing_type, city, and user cohort tags for
citybycity rollout measurement.

K\) Risks & mitigations (known issues, bakedin controls)

Scope creep with Studios → Mitigation: subhub + attachinflow only;
capped city inventory; clear KPIs/killswitch.

Policy confusion in LBG → Mitigation: separate booking lines, sidebyside
outcomes, pertype receipts.

Growth vs brand safety → Mitigation: Safe Mode default; artisticonly
policy; clear surveillance & hazard disclosures.

Infra cost (media) → Mitigation: previews only; externallink manifest;
virus scan on previews; cap perthread size.

Fairness perception → Mitigation: transparent ranking rules; labeled
promotions; eligibility gates.

L\) Acceptance Criteria (mark Section 4 FINAL)

Entity model (Account, Service Profile, Studio Listing, Booking, LBG,
Thread, Smart Docs, Delivery, Verification, Reputation, Promotion,
Support Case) defined and referenced consistently.

Global flows (Discover → Plan → Book → Work → Close → Support)
documented with no missing steps.

Surface families enumerated (public/buyer/seller/host/cross/admin) to
drive the Page Map in §4.0.

Nav model defined (desktop/mobile) with Safe Mode and city context
always accessible.

Ranking & fairness contract documented (relevance first; promotions
capped & labeled).

Safety/privacy/perf baselines established (Safe Mode, address privacy,
hazard toggles, perf budgets).

Analytics event families declared (to wire telemetry from day one).

Studios confirmed as space listings with subhub + AttachinFlow only at
launch; LBG contract in place.

Nongoals (full venue marketplace features) explicitly excluded from
launch scope.

M\) Why this works

Clarity → speed: Clean entities and flows make the UI obvious and the
marketplace predictable.

Scales by addition, not revision: New roles or more studio inventory
slot into the same model.

Trust is structural: Verification, Safe Mode, and separate booking
ledgers are baked into the architecture, not bolted on.

Launchable: We can ship citybycity with confidence and expand without
rewiring the product.

§4.0 --- Page Map (HighLevel)

Contract: Every user task has a screen and a clear next step. Pages are
grouped by Public, Buyer, Seller (roles), Host (studios), Crosscutting,
and Admin. Each entry lists route pattern, owner, key sections, and
primary CTAs. Mobile uses the same routes; some interactions open as
drawers/modals.

A\) Routing & Guardrails (global)

Route shape: kebabcase; city context as query (?city=houston) or chip;
IDs as slugs.

Auth gates: actions that create/modify bookings or messages route
through /auth with return URL.

Safe Mode: default ON. Hides FanSubscription Creator role & 18+ nudity
tiers; studios are unaffected (SFW media only).

City awareness: city selector persistent; saved to profile/cookie.

Error routes: /404, /403, /maintenance.

SEO: canonical URLs & city/role landing pages (see Public).
