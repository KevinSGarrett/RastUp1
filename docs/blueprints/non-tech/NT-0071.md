king + payments + verification).

Oneclick outcomes: prorata refund %, reedit order, fee waivers.

Evidence viewer: manifests, checkin/out map, file autocheck results,
social verification logs.

Policy macros: cancellation matrix variants, safety scripts,
adverseaction (BG) templates.

Account controls: IB toggle, visibility throttle, boost suppress,
temporary hold.

Ledger safety: doubleentry adjustments; immutable audit log.

I\) SLAs, Coverage & Staffing

Coverage: Safety 24/7; general support 16×5 at launch (expand to 24×7 by
city #3).

Response targets: P0 ≤ 5 min; P1 ≤ 30 min; P2 ≤ 4 h; P3 ≤ 1 biz day.

Resolution targets: P1 ≤ 12 h; P2 ≤ 48 h; P3 ≤ 3 biz days.

Houston pilot staffing: 1 Safety lead (oncall rotation), 2--3
generalists (day/evening), parttime adjudicator for Neutral Reviews.

J\) Metrics & Guardrails

CSAT: ≥ 4.6/5; FRT & TTR on target per priority.

Autoresolution rate: ≥ 50% of cases resolved selfserve.

Refund leakage: within plan; buyer fee refunds only on provider
fault/safety.

Dispute reopen rate: \< 8%.

Chargeback ratio: \< 0.8%; representment win rate \> 55%.

Safety: P0 median ≤ 3 min, repeat offenders caught; policy violations \<
0.3% of bookings.

Fairness: outcomes distribution consistent across roles/cities (monitor
for bias).

K\) Acceptance Criteria (mark 3.9 FINAL)

Selfserve flows live: date/time change, addons, travel adj, refund
request, noshow, delivery problem, safety report.

Refund engine implements matrices above, with autocure windows and
prorata calculations.

Dispute center inthread: evidence collection, timers, Neutral Review
workflow, decision & receipts reissue.

Chargeback kit generator; reserves & IB gating rules wired.

Safety pipeline: P0 hotline, IB/boost suppress toggles, evidence
preservation.

KB published; inline tips & "Why this decision?" links live.

Agent console: macros, ledger adjustments, audit logs.

Analytics dashboards: CSAT, FRT/TTR, refund leakage, reopen, chargeback,
safety SLA.

L\) Why this works

Predictable & fair: Users see the same rules we apply; most outcomes are
obvious from the matrix.

Fast & scalable: Selfserve, timers, and autochecks keep humans for edge
cases.

Trustpreserving: Safety first, evidencedriven decisions, and fee
policies aligned with fault.

Marginaware: Buyer fee refunds only on provider fault; prorata logic
prevents overrefunds; chargeback playbooks contain losses.

Addendum --- §3.9 Support, Refunds, Disputes & Knowledge Base (Studios)
--- FINAL

Scope: Minimal but required clarifications so §3.9 cleanly covers Studio
bookings and Linked Booking Groups (Talent + Studio in one checkout),
without changing previously approved talent policies.

A\) SelfServe Flows (additions)

Add the following quick actions under Inthread ▸ Get help:

Studio ▸ Access issue (can't enter / code not working)

Studio ▸ Damage claim (hostinitiated; requires photos & description)

Studio ▸ Postbooking adjustment (overtime / crewsize overage / rule
violation)

Linked Group ▸ Propose reschedule (sync both bookings)

Linked Group ▸ Split or cancel (show sidebyside outcomes per policy)

B\) Refund Matrices (references & summary)

Talent cancellations & disputes: unchanged (see main §3.9 matrix).

Studio cancellations: use the Studio matrix (default bands: \>7d=100%
refund; 7--48h=50%; \<48h/noshow=0%).

Linked Booking Groups (LBG): outcomes are computed per booking and shown
in one summary (e.g., "Talent: 50% refund • Studio: 0% refund"). Support
agents use the LBG outcome view when editing/issuing refunds.

C\) Evidence Sets (studiospecific)

For Studio disputes we prioritize the following system evidence
(autoattached where available):

Checkin/out timestamps + geofence pass/fail.

House Rules & Property Release esign audit logs.

Access logs (door code release/time sent; if integrated).

Before/after photos (host; timestamped).

Overtime/overage indicators (End time vs booked End; crew count notes).

Calendar state at booking time (to counter "doubl
