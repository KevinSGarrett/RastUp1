limited Support (view-only for ticket replies).\
What it covers: W9 onboarding & edelivery consent, TIN matching, 1099
generation/efile/delivery/corrections, marketplace salestax nexus
tracking, tax category mapping, calculation monitoring, return filing
calendar, audit pack exports.

Guardrails: Changes that affect tax exposure (nexus list, category map,
backdated overrides, rate overrides) require twoperson approval per
§4.14.1.

B\) Dashboards & Queues

Tax Overview (/admin/tax)

Tiles: W9 coverage %, TIN mismatch open, 1099 run status, states with
nexus, calc error rate, next filings due.

Trendlines: taxable vs nontaxable share by role; effective tax collected
by state/city.

Queues

W9 Missing/Invalid (payoutblocking on): missing, expired name/TIN,
signature not captured.

TIN Mismatch: new mismatches, under review, resolved.

1099 Exceptions: address issues, duplicate TINs, threshold edge cases,
bounced emails, paper mail required.

Calc Exceptions: timeouts, "no code found," zero tax where expected,
jurisdiction mismatch.

C\) W9 / TIN / EDelivery Management

W9 Control Panel

Status filters: Not started • In progress • Submitted • Valid • Needs
correction.

Actions: Request W9 (nudge), Resend link, Block payouts toggle
(automated default ON when missing), Mark corrected after user
resubmits.

Evidence: signed PDF, submission timestamp, IP/device, consent texts.

TIN Match (soft)

Batch and ondemand checks; results classified: Match • Mismatch •
Indeterminate.

Workflow: On mismatch → Notify user (selfserve fix) → if unresolved in 7
days, escalate to Support for assisted correction → remain
payoutblocked.

Audit: history of match attempts, result codes; no raw SSN ever shown
(PII scope gates per §4.14.1).

EDelivery Consent

Global percentage, by cohort.

Actions: Request consent template, Revoke on user request.

If no consent or unopened by deadline, queue paper mail fulfillment with
address verification.

D\) 1099 Runs & Corrections

Config (no code)

Thresholds: dynamic edition (managed by Finance) with notes; never
hardcoded into receipts.

Form type: platformissued 1099NEC vs processorissued (if using PSE
route) --- select per tax season.

Run windows: preclose (draft), final generate, efile, deliver (by Jan 31
target).

Run Workflow

Preflight: snapshot gross payouts, exclude refunds/chargebacks as policy
dictates; show exceptions (missing W9, TIN mismatch, missing address).

Preview: perpayee summary with deltas vs prior drafts; download sample
PDFs; dual approval to proceed.

Efile: submit batch to filing provider (IRS + Combined Federal/State
where applicable); capture submission IDs.

Deliver: email with secure link to PDF for consented users; queue mail
for the rest; track opens and bounces.

Corrections: create CCORR entries with reason (address fix, amount
update, TIN correction); refile and redeliver; maintain version chain.

Status & Controls

States: Draft • Pending approval • Filed • Delivered • Correction
pending.

Bounced/undeliverable queue with address change flow (Support can help).

Export 1099 Ledger CSV: payee, TIN masked, gross, box amounts, file IDs.

E\) SalesTax Nexus & Category Mapping (Marketplace Facilitator)

Nexus Map

States list with toggles: Collect & remit ON/OFF, basis
(economic/physical), notes.

Economic triggers monitor: GMV and transaction count by state vs
configurable thresholds; alert if approaching.

Twoperson approval to mark a state ON/OFF; prompt to schedule effective
date/time.

Category Mapping (what is being taxed)

Role/service to tax code mapping (e.g., Talent service,
Photography/Videography service, Studio shortterm rental, Cleaning fee,
Digital license).

Editor: pick codes from tax engine catalog; perstate overrides where
needed; reason required; dual approval for overrides.

Simulation: price example shows expected tax in a target city/county;
compares before/after.
