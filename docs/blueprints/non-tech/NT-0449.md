 disputes.\
• Admin MVP: support refunds/amendments, content redaction,
impersonate/view‑as, audits.\
• Policy drafts: ToS, Privacy, Content/Safety; examples gallery for
artistic‑only and Safe‑Mode.

Feature Flags & City Gates:\
• feature.booking.core, feature.messaging.core, feature.admin.mini,
feature.tax.allowlist=false (sandbox), feature.idv.sandbox.

Dependencies & Inputs:\
• Engineering environment, CI/CD, feature flag system, observability
stack (§5.12), ticketing (Support/Trust).

Top Risks & Mitigations:\
• Schema churn; admin gaps; unclear policy copy; vendor SLA surprises.

Instrumentation & KPIs:\
• Synthetic loop pass rate; admin task completion without engineering;
staging stability; event completeness to Gold.

Acceptance Criteria (Go/No‑Go):\
✓ Core loop passes end‑to‑end in staging; admin can amend receipts and
issue refunds; policy drafts ready for counsel review.

Staffing & Ownership:\
• Founding Eng squad; Data engineer; Product/Design; Support/Trust
liaisons; Legal consult; SRE.

Milestones & Checkpoints:\
• Schema freeze; admin MVP; sandbox vendors functioning; policy and help
drafts staged.

Implementation Notes:\
• Flag Discipline: Each capability ships behind a named flag with a
runbook, owner, rollback, and blast‑radius notes. Flags default to
\'off\' in new cities.\
• Admin Operability: No workstream is \'done\' until admin tools enable
Support/Trust/Finance to handle the top 3 edge cases without
engineering.\
• Copy & Policy: All flows have help‑center articles and email/SMS
templates; copy avoids legalese and links to policy examples.\
• QA & Drills: Staging mimics production data shapes; drills include
processor/tax outages, moderation surges, and incident command
handoffs.\
• Experimentation: Features that affect marketplace economics (ranking,
boosts, fees) include holdouts and guardrails; we measure incremental
impact.\
• Data Wiring: Events land in Bronze/Silver/Gold (§5); KPIs pull only
from Gold with freshness SLOs. Definitions live in a metrics catalog.\
• Accessibility: New UI complies with WCAG 2.1 AA; screen‑reader and
keyboard paths verified; contrast ratios checked; defects triaged.\
• Security & Privacy: PII masked by default; JIT elevation for sensitive
admin actions; vendor scopes minimal; audits immutable.\
• City Readiness: City‑first artifacts (press kit, creator ambassadors,
studio partners) prepared in §10.1 runbook.\
• Post‑Launch: 7/30/90‑day reviews convert observations into roadmap
changes; flags let us tune by city without forks.
