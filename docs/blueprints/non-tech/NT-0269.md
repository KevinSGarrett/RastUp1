• Evidence Hygiene: store hashes and immutable links; redact PII in
views; never edit originals; legal holds override deletion where

Context & Alignment: We are launching a US‑only creative marketplace
focused on models, photographers, videographers, and content creators.\
We have chosen a subscription‑free go‑to‑market with monetization via
take‑rate and optional, usage‑based promotions that are
