estrictions, and account holds;
doxxing treated as severe violation.\
• False‑positive safety net: quick appeal channel; restore with apology
copy when moderation erred.

Data, Privacy & Retention:\
• PII minimization in reports and queues; moderator access restricted
and audited; redaction tools for public pages.\
• Media retention: we store only thumbnails and metadata for moderation;
full files remain in external storage controlled by the creator.

Templates & Required Notices (internal/external):\
• Moderator templates: decision rationales; user copies for
blur/label/remove; appeal receipts; escalation one‑pagers.\
• Safe‑Mode explainer: visual examples; toggle confirmation; guest
banner copy.

Compliance Metrics & Audits:\
• Safety reports per 1,000 legs; appeal reversal rates; classifier
precision/recall; IB suppression counts; time‑to‑action SLAs.\
• Harassment recurrence after intervention; user trust scores in
post‑moderation surveys.

Risks & Mitigations:\
• Over‑ or under‑moderation → calibrate classifiers; publish examples;
empower appeals.\
• Creator backlash → provide transparent explanations; avoid
condescending tone; keep humans in loop for close calls.

Acceptance Checklist (ready to externalize):\
□ Policy page with examples live; Safe‑Mode default verified; moderation
queues staffed; classifier thresholds tested; appeal paths documented.
