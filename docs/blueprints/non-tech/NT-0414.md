 security advice.
Coordinate with counsel and security leaders before externalizing any
policy or committing to obligations. All examples are illustrative and
must be adapted to the realities measured in Section 5 dashboards.

Context & Alignment: US‑only marketplace launch; subscription‑free
start; monetization via take‑rate and usage‑based promotions with strict
eligibility and caps. Public content is artistic‑only with Safe‑Mode
defaults for guests. Deliverables are exchanged via external links
(Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests; escrowed payments release on
acceptance. Instant Book requires ID verification; background checks are
opt‑in (Trusted Pro). Rollouts are city‑gated behind feature flags.
Admin Console enforces least‑privilege, JIT elevation, two‑person
approvals, and full audit trails.

Goals:\
• Protect cash flows with robust processor integrations, reserves, and
dispute playbooks.\
• Minimize tax exposure with allowlists and reconciliations; prevent
miscollection.\
• Keep promotions billing clean with invalid‑click credits and audits.

Risk statements (top of mind):\
• Processor outage or webhook lag causes failed checkouts and delayed
payouts.\
• Chargebacks spike from \'services not rendered\' claims; representment
fails.\
• ACH returns increase; buyer fee discount abused without actual
collection benefit.\
• Tax engine misclassification causes over/under‑collection;
reconciliation variance.\
• Promotions billing errors; invalid clicks; ROAS falls below target.

Primary causes & contributing factors:\
• Single‑threaded webhooks; lack of retries; no queue health monitors.\
• Poor deliverables acceptance; unclear SOW; missing evidence
packaging.\
• Weak bank link verification; unclear ACH discount message.\
• Item category mapping errors; missing city allowlists; tax outage
without fallback.\
• Fraud schemes; mis‑targeted paid delivery; quality score mis‑weights.

Leading indicators & early warning signals:\
• Checkout success drop; payout \'queued\' backlog; settlement variance
alarms.\
• Chargeback rate \> 0.6%; win rate declines; dispute reasons cluster.\
• ACH return codes trend; buyer fee complaints; low ACH adoption despite
discount.\
• Tax quote latency/errors; support tickets on taxes; state variance in
reconciliation.\
• Invalid‑click credit rate \> 7%; buyer hide/report on promoted cards
rises.

Preventive controls & mitigations:\
• Queueing with idempotency; retry workers; multiple processors
readiness; ACH fallback path.\
• Manifest and acceptance flows; chargeback kits; SOW templates; refund
calculators.\
• Strong onboarding for ACH; clear savings math; returns handling
macros.\
• Tax allowlist; pending‑tax banner; nightly reconciliation and credits
memos.\
• Eligibility gates; density caps; QS tuning; holdouts and auto‑credits.

Incident playbooks (summary):\
• Processor incident: prefer ACH; pause promotions; status banners;
drain queues post‑incident.\
• Chargeback wave: strengthen evidence; reach‑outs; review refund policy
adherence; coaching providers.\
• Tax outage: allowlist affected states; capture; amend later; user
notices.

RACI / Owners:\
• Payments PM/Eng, Finance, Tax PM, Growth (promotions), Support.

Instrumentation & success metrics:\
• Checkout success; payout latency; chargeback win rate; ACH adoption;
tax variance; promotions ROAS.

Thresholds & triggers (Go/No‑Go, rollback, escalation):\
• Sev‑1 for checkout/payout; chargebacks \> threshold; tax errors \>
threshold; ROAS \< 2.5× median.

Dependencies & assumptions:\
• §4.12 payments/tax center; §5 telemetry; §10.3 drills; processor/tax
vendor SLAs.

Acceptance checklist (risk under control when):\
□ Daily close green 14 days; chargeback kit quality audits ≥95%; tax
reconciliations tight; invalid‑click credits automated.

Scenario Deep‑Dive --- Chargeback ring:\
Context: Clustered BIN and IPs; services not rendered claims.\
Trigger: Chargeback rate spikes; win rate drops.\
Immediate actions: Flag accounts; require IDV; stren
