 (perbooking) economics

Provider fee (commission): 12% of booking subtotal (packages + extras +
license + travel).\
Why: This benchmarks lower than creator marketplaces like Collabstr
(15%), Swipecast (15%), and Peerspace host fees (15--20%), while
remaining close to Upwork's freelancer fee (10%)---so we're competitive
for launch without undercutting our margins.

Buyer service fee: 5% (min \$3); 3% when paid via ACH (once available).\
Why: Buyer fees around 5--5.5% are common on large marketplaces (e.g.,
Fiverr 5.5% + a smallorder fee), and Upwork charges 3--5% depending on
payment method/plan. Our \$3 minimum ensures we cover processing on
small bookings, and the ACH discount mirrors market norms and nudges
lowercost rails.

Processing costs: paid out of platform take (the buyer fee largely
offsets card fees at \~2.9% + \$0.30 in the U.S.; ACH is lower). Note:
card processing fees from the original transaction aren't returned on
refunds (industry standard).

Refund policy on fees:

If provider cancels or safety exception → refund buyer service fee.

If buyer cancels per policy → service fee is nonrefundable (covers
payment ops & support).

Provider fee adjusts automatically to the final job value after any
discounts/refunds.

Why this mix: Simple, predictable, and aligned with market expectations
and our earlystage unit economics. 5% buyer keeps us in line with Upwork
and below/near Fiverr's charge to buyers; 12% provider undercuts or
matches comparable verticals.

2\) Fee adjusters (nudge the right behavior)

Instant Book discount: Provider fee --1% on Instant Book transactions
(promotes "buy now").

Trusted Pro (backgroundchecked) discount: Provider fee --0.5% (rewards
safety investment).

Highvalue tiering: On the portion above \$1,000 in a single booking,
provider fee drops to 10% (keeps big jobs onplatform; echoes the "volume
discount" concept users recognize from legacy Upwork tiers).

Newmarket promos (timeboxed): e.g., \$0 buyer fee on first booking in a
launch city; or --2% provider for first 60 days postlaunch.

All discounts are stackable with a floor (e.g., provider fee floor =
9%).

3\) What we don't charge for

DMs and inquiries (within fairuse credits; see §3.2).

Tips (0% platform fee on tips, paid postcompletion)---a clear
differentiator vs. platforms that take a cut of tips.

TFP/Collab Mode (no cash) --- no commission; we monetize indirectly
(Pro, boosts).

B\) Escrow, payout timing & reserves (recap, monetization lens)

Escrow on accept/book: we hold funds until completion/milestones (see
§1.3).

Payout timing: standard 48h after completion; newprovider reserve (e.g.,
first 1--3 payouts delayed up to 7 days or 10% rolling reserve) to
reduce fraud/chargeback risk.

Early Payout (Pro preview for §3.2): selected providers with strong Rep
Score can receive same/nextday payouts for an optional 0.5%
payoutacceleration fee (applied to the provider fee component).

C\) Worked examples (realistic, stepbystep)

We keep the math explicit so Finance & Product implement identical
calculations.

Example 1 --- \$300 booking, default fees, no discounts

Booking subtotal: \$300

Buyer service fee (5%): 0.05 × 300 = \$15 → Buyer pays \$315

Provider fee (12% of \$300): 0.12 × 300 = \$36

Provider takehome (preprocessing): \$300 − \$36 = \$264

Processor cost (illustrative): assume 2.9% + \$0.30 on \$315

2.9% of 315 = \$9.135; + \$0.30 = \$9.435 (≈ \$9.44)

Platform gross on this booking (before ops):

Revenue = provider fee \$36 + buyer fee \$15 = \$51

Less processing ≈ \$9.44 → Net ≈ \$41.56.

Example 2 --- \$600 booking, Instant Book (--1%) + Trusted Pro (--0.5%)

Buyer service fee (5%): 0.05 × 600 = \$30 → Buyer pays \$630

Provider fee base (12%): \$72

Discounted provider fee (10.5%): 0.105 × 600 = \$63

Provider takehome: \$600 − \$63 = \$537

Platform revenue preprocessing: \$63 + \$30 = \$93

Processing (2.9% + \$0.30) on \$630: \$18.57

Net to platform (before ops): \$74.43.
