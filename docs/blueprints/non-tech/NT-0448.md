 PII masked by default; JIT elevation for sensitive
admin actions; vendor scopes minimal; audits immutable.\
• City Readiness: City‑first artifacts (press kit, creator ambassadors,
studio partners) prepared in §10.1 runbook.\
• Post‑Launch: 7/30/90‑day reviews convert observations into roadmap
changes; flags let us tune by city without forks.

Implementation Notes:\
• Flag Discipline: Each capability ships behind a named flag with a
runbook, owner, rollback, and blast‑radius notes. Flags default to
\'off\' in new cities.\
• Admin Operability: No workstream is \'done\' until admin tools enable
Support/Trust/Finance to handle the top 3 edge cases without
engineering.\
• Copy & Policy: All flows have help‑center articles and email/SMS
templates; copy avoids legalese and links to policy examples.\
• QA & Drills: Staging mimics production data shapes; drills include
processor/tax outages, moderation surges, and incident command
handoffs.\
• Experimentation: Features that affect marketplace economics (ranking,
boosts, fees) include holdouts and guardrails; we measure incremental
impact.\
• Data Wiring: Events land in Bronze/Silver/Gold (§5); KPIs pull only
from Gold with freshness SLOs. Definitions live in a metrics catalog.\
• Accessibility: New UI complies with WCAG 2.1 AA; screen‑reader and
keyboard paths verified; contrast ratios checked; defects triaged.\
• Security & Privacy: PII masked by default; JIT elevation for sensitive
admin actions; vendor scopes minimal; audits immutable.\
• City Readiness: City‑first artifacts (press kit, creator ambassadors,
studio partners) prepared in §10.1 runbook.\
• Post‑Launch: 7/30/90‑day reviews convert observations into roadmap
changes; flags let us tune by city without forks.

Roadmap Disclaimer: This is an internal planning document. Dates are
placeholders and will firm up as Section 5 telemetry validates
conversion and quality gates. All items ship behind flags and city
allowlists. Nothing herein creates external commitments.

Context & Alignment: US‑only creative marketplace; subscription‑free at
launch; monetization via take‑rate and usage‑based promotions with
eligibility gates and strict caps; public content limited to
artistic‑only (guest Safe‑Mode on by default); deliverables handled via
external links (Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests; escrowed
payments released on acceptance; Instant Book gated by ID verification;
optional background checks confer Trusted Pro; city‑gated rollout with
feature flags; strong Admin Console with least‑privilege, JIT elevation,
two‑person approvals, and immutable audits.

Timeframe & Scope:\
• T‑90 to T‑45 days before Alpha invite (internal & selected creators).

Goals:\
• Stand up core data schemas and events; ensure Admin Console MVP
supports support/trust workflows.\
• Draft policy and help content aligned to product scope (artistic‑only
public, Safe‑Mode default).\
• Select vendors (processor(s), ACH, tax, IDV/BG, e‑signature, comms)
and wire sandbox integrations.

Product Themes:\
• Get the foundation right: data, admin, identity, money contracts, and
reversible flags.\
• Internal dogfooding with synthetic bookings to validate core loop and
receipts.

Workstreams & Deliverables:\
• Data models: users, roles, service profiles, packages, bookings
(legs), payments, receipts, promotions, audits.\
• Events: search, inquiry, booking request, acceptance, change order,
deliverables manifest, acceptance, payout queued/sent, disputes.\
• Admin MVP: support refunds/amendments, content redaction,
impersonate/view‑as, audits.\
• Policy drafts: ToS, Privacy, Content/Safety; examples gallery for
artistic‑only and Safe‑Mode.

Feature Flags & City Gates:\
• feature.booking.core, feature.messaging.core, feature.admin.mini,
feature.tax.allowlist=false (sandbox), feature.idv.sandbox.

Dependencies & Inputs:\
• Engineering envi
