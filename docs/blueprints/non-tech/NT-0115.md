ion.

Finance: payouts/reserves, manual adjustments (with twoperson approval),
chargebacks, coupons.

Tax & Compliance: W9/TIN dashboard, 1099 runs, nexus map overrides
(dualapproval).

Content: reviews/profile/feed moderation, keyword lists, SafeMode
thresholds (preview only).

Ops (City/Market): promos, CPC floors, Featured slots, foundingcity
perks.

Marketing: homepage modules, email templates, coupon creation (no money
moves).

ReadOnly Auditor: dashboards/exports; masked PII; no changes.

Permission scopes:

PIIBasic: email, phone (masked by default; unmask requires reason).

PIISensitive: address, DOB (unmask gate).

PIITax: TIN, W9 PDFs, 1099 (Tax role only; dualapproval to unmask).

PIIBackground: consumer report artifacts (Trust only; FCRA training
required).

MoneyCritical: manual payout, fee override, deposit capture \>\$1k
(twoperson rule).

SafetyCritical: IB suppression, account hold (reason & SLA tag).

C\) Login, Session & Device Controls

SSO (admin): enforce SSO (e.g., Okta/Google), 2FA required (TOTP or
hardware key).

IP/Geo rules (optional): block risky geos; allow admin office IPs.

Session policy: 12hour max; 15minute idle timeout; reauth for sensitive
actions.

Device trust: label devices; new device prompts email confirmation.

Environment banner: persistent "PROD"/"SANDBOX" badge with color coding.

D\) JustinTime Elevation & TwoPerson Approvals

JIT elevation: click "Request elevation" → select scope (e.g.,
MoneyCritical), add reason + ticket link → manager/peer approves →
30--120 min token granted → autorevoke and log.

Twoperson rule: actions requiring cosign (examples):

Manual payout, fee override, deposit capture \>\$1k, tax nexus
overrides, adverse action finalization (background), permanent account
disable.

UI shows "Awaiting cosign" chip; approver sees payload diff before
confirming.

E\) PII Handling & Redaction

Masked by default: show •••• for sensitive fields; "Unmask (reason)"
button with scope check.

Download controls: exporting tables with PII requires scope + download
reason; big red banner with "Contains PII."

Inline redaction: Support/Content can redact userposted PII from
threads/reviews (stores original hashed reference; shows "Redacted
(Support)" tag).

PII view ledger: who accessed what PII, when, and why; exportable for
audits.

F\) Impersonation vs. ViewAs

ViewAs (safe default): renders the UI with PII masked; no write actions;
used for reproducing UI issues.

Impersonate (restricted): requires JIT elevation + reason; write actions
allowed, but money moves disabled in impersonation; session banner
"IMPERSONATING {user}"; all actions doublelogged (actor + target).

Guardrails: cannot impersonate Super Admins; timeboxed; logs include
IP/device.

G\) Audit & Change History

Immutable audit log capturing: actor, role, IP/device, route, entity
IDs, before/after diff, reason code, linked ticket/case.

Entity Timelines: on users, bookings, payouts, disputes, promotions:
chronological stack of admin/user/system events.

Searchable audits: by actor, entity, reason, time range; export to
CSV/PDF; retention policies applied.

Legal hold: mark entities to suspend purge (links to §4.14.15).

H\) Admin UI Patterns (Safety by Design)

Action drawers with required reason, preview of impact, and secondary
confirmation for risky moves.

Risk badges (P0/P1/P2) appear on threads/safety cases; timers visible.

Kill switches (flagged in §4.14.2): big, red, twostep with summary (what
services will pause, who's impacted).

Environmentaware copy: SANDBOX disallows emails/payouts; "simulation
only" labels.

I\) Alerts & Anomaly Detection

Highrisk action alerts to Slack/email: manual payouts, deposit captures,
fee overrides, permanent disables, tax overrides.

Anomaly monitors:

"TIN views by a single admin \> N/day"

"Refunds issued \> \$X in 1h"

"IB suppressions \> Y/day by same actor"

"Mass role changes"

Daily digest: PII views, highrisk actions, failed JIT requests; link to
audits.
