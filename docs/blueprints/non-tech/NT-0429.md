ges without fallbacks; misaligned SLAs; long recovery
times.\
• On‑call fatigue; unclear incident roles; slow MTTR.

Primary causes & contributing factors:\
• Under‑forecasted volume; insufficient training; admin gaps.\
• Rapid product changes; copy not versioned; lack of ownership.\
• Vendor contracts weak; no status notifications; single points of
failure.\
• On‑call rotations too thin; no drills; tools missing.

Leading indicators & early warning signals:\
• FRT/FRR breaches; reopen rates; CSAT drop; internal escalations rise.\
• Macro usage declines; ticket notes reveal confusion; help‑center views
spike without resolution.\
• Vendor latency and error alerts; outage durations; manual overrides
used.\
• Incident count rises; MTTA/MTTR increases; paging fatigue reports.

Preventive controls & mitigations:\
• Staffing buffers; surge plan; calculators/macros; admin tools; office
hours.\
• KB versioning; DRI for each macro; release notes to support; periodic
reviews.\
• Vendor SLAs; failover tests; status webhooks; backup vendors or
fallbacks.\
• On‑call training; incident roles; drills; better tooling for runbooks
and flags.

Incident playbooks (summary):\
• Support surge: triage queue; prioritize money/safety; extend hours;
auto‑responses for low severity.\
• Vendor outage: switch to fallback; communicate; reconcile later.\
• On‑call fatigue: add backup rotation; lighten non‑incident workload;
coaching.

RACI / Owners:\
• Support lead, Trust lead, SRE, Vendor manager, Product ops.

Instrumentation & success metrics:\
• FRT/FRR; reopen; CSAT; staffing vs forecast; incident MTTR; vendor
uptime vs SLA.

Thresholds & triggers (Go/No‑Go, rollback, escalation):\
• Two weeks of SLA misses → staffing or scope change; vendor \< 99.9% →
escalation per contract.

Dependencies & assumptions:\
• §4.14 admin tools; §10 launch plans; vendor contracts and status
hooks.

Acceptance checklist (risk under control when):\
□ Staffing plan signed; training complete; KB and macros versioned;
vendor failover tested; on‑call schedule live.

Scenario Deep‑Dive --- Support backlog post‑PR:\
Context: Large spike in tickets after press coverage.\
Trigger: Backlog \> X for \> Y hours.\
Immediate actions: Enable deflection; reassign staff; extend hours;
templates for common issues; weekly town‑hall webinar.\
Communication: Queue position notices; honest timelines.\
Rollback/Forward: Back to standard hours; retro and staffing
adjustments.\
Owner: Support lead \| Telemetry: queue_size, SLA_breaches \| Evidence:
Ticket logs; macro usage

Execution Notes:\
• Every risk has a dashboard tile with an owner, a definition of the
denominator, and a weekly narrative. • Risk reviews pair with §10
post‑launch 7/30/90‑day reviews and §8 compliance calendar. • Where a
risk spans multiple squads, the city GM or Risk DRI chairs the review;
actions have due dates. • We prefer reversible changes (flags) and
narrow blast radius (city gates). • We avoid \'security by obscurity\';
we publish clear user guidance, train staff, and keep audit trails for
all sensitive actions. • The risk register itself is versioned; changes
record rationale and observed metrics.
