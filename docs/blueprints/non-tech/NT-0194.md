orting.

ACH disputes/returns → clear copy; returns automation; ACH only for
lowrisk cohorts initially.

Background check anxiety → optin + incentives (fee nudge, Boost credit);
fast vendor SLAs; privacy copy.

Tax calc edge cases → city allowlist + automatic fallbacks; Admin
override + nightly reconciliation.

J\) Acceptance Criteria (mark §6.2 FINAL)

Social metrics filters live (IG/YT/TT/X); cards show verified chips;
queries respect ANY/ALL & Verifiedonly.

ACH live with 3% buyerfee; receipts & reconciliations correct; fallback
to card robust.

Promotions pilot live with CPC floors, weekly Featured,
caps/labels/eligibility, holdouts, invalidclick credits, QS within paid
slots.

Reputation Score v1 visible & explainable; used only as tiebreak;
filterable by Min Rep.

Trusted Pro background check flow operational; badge & fee nudge
applied; FCRA notices handled.

Boards & Posts (lite) shipped; feeds moderated; report flow & content
scan enforced.

Changeorder/reschedule v2 adjusts escrow and reissues amended receipts.

Tax engine calculating where enabled; exports generated; daily close
remains on time.

Admin promos panel, support macros, and T&S queues functioning; all
actions audited.

Beta KPIs met or trending toward targets for 3 consecutive weeks.

K\) Why this works

Adds highsignal discovery (verified social), lower checkout cost (ACH),
and optional distribution (promotions) without corrupting relevance.

Builds trust (IDV + Trusted Pro + Reputation) while keeping friction low
(optin, explainable).

Introduces engagement loops (Boards, Posts) that compound supply/demand
without distracting from bookings.

All changes are flaggated, measured, and reversible---so we can
coursecorrect quickly.

§6.3 --- Phase2 GA (T+90 → T+180)

Goal: Reach General Availability in Houston and start a City2 pilot with
a complete, trustworthy marketplace loop---LBG checkout (talent +
optional studio in one flow), Studios marketplace + deposits, Early
Payout (peruse), Promotions GA (usagebased, capped), Tax at scale, and
the experiment platform + ML ranker canary. Keep everything flaggated,
auditable, and reversible.

A\) Scope (what we add vs keep off)

In (GA adds)

LBG (LegBased Group) checkout: book talent and a studio in one cart, one
charge; split receipts and audit lines per leg; unified scheduling and
conflicts.

Studios marketplace: verified studio profiles, amenities, calendars,
pricing, deposit authorization (damage/overage) and houserules; studio
verification badge.

Early Payout (peruse): qualified providers (Rep ≥ 85 + ID Verified) can
opt to accelerate payout on completed legs for a 0.5% peruse fee
(applied to providerfee portion only).

Promotions GA: widen eligibility and inventory with city tier controls;
Boost (CPC) + Featured (weekly) fully supported with holdouts, ROAS
dashboards, and fraud protections.

Tax at scale: expand engine coverage beyond TX with city/state config;
refunds/amendments; daily tax exports.

Experimentation platform: assignment, exposure, guardrails, sequential
tests (per §5.13).

ML ranker (canary): rerank organic results within guardrails; city and
surfacegated; instant killswitch.

Payments hardening: ACH returns automation, partial refunds across legs,
settlement reconciliation v2.

Out (defer/optional)

Subscriptions (remain off; see §3.2 launch stance).

Complex media hosting (stay with external deliverables + manifest).

International (USonly).

B\) Deliverables & Acceptance Tests (DoD)

LBG checkout

Cart builder: add a talent leg (rolespecific package & addons) →
optionally add a studio leg (hourly + cleaning/amenities) with schedule
alignment.

Conflict detection: availability calendars checked; travel time hints.

Charge & escrow: one charge → lineitem allocations to legs; escrow per
leg.

Receipts: LBG group receipt with Talent and Studio sections + group
summary; later amended receipts on changes/refunds.

DoD: schedule conflict guardrails; successful split allocations; refunds
