ticket tagged BILLING with last 4 of card, error code.

"Where is my payout?" → show payout timeline & status → if past SLA,
open PAYOUTDELAY with booking and bankonfile.

triggers Reschedule or Cancel action card directly.

per policy; if contested, opens DISPUTE with attached evidence.

opens MISSINGDELIVERABLES if timer expires.

For quality complaints: gathers specifics (what vs. agreed); suggests
partial settlement; creates QUALITYDISPUTE if unresolved.

IDVMANUALREVIEW only if necessary.
