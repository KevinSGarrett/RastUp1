Reviews spillover: Do not mix ratings across roles in search ranking.
Display crossrole ratings in the header for transparency only.

16\) MVP vs. PhaseUp (for scope control)

MVP must haves:

Linked Service Profiles; rolefirst search; rolespecific fields &
portfolios; roleanchored bookings; rolespecific reviews; unified inbox
with role tags; basic follows; basic favorites boards; verification +
incentives (email/phone/ID); availability blocking; NSFW gating switch
(policy-dependent).

Phase 2+ enhancements:

Packages catalogs, advanced board collaboration, post analytics, social
metrics verification integrations, audience demographics for creators,
compare view for boards, saved search alerts, deep calendar sync, and
DND windows.

17\) Acceptance Criteria (we can check these off)

From a Model search, multirole users appear only as Model cards with
rolespecific fields.

On reaching a profile from search, the Model tab is active; switching
tabs shows other roles without leaving the page.

Booking, messaging, and reviews are tied to the active role.

The inbox groups threads with role context and shows read receipts.

Users can post once and tag the role(s); feeds and profile posts filter
accordingly.

Favorites boards accept both role cards and full users; boards are
organizable and shareable.

Verification badges grant DM credits and search boost; credits are
visible in a simple meter.

Calendar is global; bookings on any role block time across all roles.

Design Rationale (short)

Rolescoped everything (search, rates, reviews, portfolio) = zero
confusion for buyers.

One account, linked Service Profiles = low maintenance for multirole
users (shared assets, one inbox).

Incentivized verification = safer community + tangible growth perks.

Categoryfirst search = faster decisionmaking + cleaner filters.

Boards & posts = stickiness, collaboration, and social proof without
turning into a job board.

Addendum to §1.1 --- Roles & IA

FanSubscription Creator (OnlyFans/Fansly/etc.) --- Role Definition

New role (toplevel): FanSubscription Creator (icon + label). Appears
alongside Model / Photographer / Videographer / Creator in nav and
onboarding.

Age gate & safe mode: The global "18+ results" toggle defaults OFF for
guests/new users. Turning it ON (with age confirmation) reveals
FanSubscription Creators and any profiles with Nudity Tier \> Lingerie.

Portfolio policy: Onplatform nonexplicit content only (artistic nudity
allowed per policy). Explicit sexual content/acts are prohibited. Links
to paid fan platforms are allowed in a dedicated "Links" block.

Deliverables scope: We support SFW collaborations and promo deliverables
(IG/TT/YT/X). We do not facilitate explicit content production or sale.

Acceptance criteria

"FanSubscription Creator" is its own role in the role picker, navbar,
and category landing pages.

Global 18+ toggle (default OFF) gates visibility; explanatory tooltip
clarifies policy.

Profile "Links" block exists; portfolio upload filters block explicit
content.

Addendum --- §1.1 Roles & Entity Model (Studios as Space Listings) ---
FINAL

Goal: Introduce Studios as space listings (not roles) that complement
talent bookings without diluting the core multirole account model. Keep
terminology crisp so search, profiles, reviews, and booking policies
remain coherent.

A\) Entities & Terminology (strictly §1.1 scope)

Account --- one login that can own multiple assets.

Service Profile (Role) --- a person-based offering the account can
operate under:\
Model • Photographer • Videographer • Creator • FanSubscription Creator
(unchanged).

Space Listing (Listing Type) --- a place-based offering the account can
own: Studio.

When verified via the light process in §3.4, it displays the Verified
Studio badge.

Key distinction: Studios are listings, not roles. Service Profiles
represent people; Studio represents a rentable space.

B\) Relationships (what can link to what)

An Account may own 0..N Service Profiles and
