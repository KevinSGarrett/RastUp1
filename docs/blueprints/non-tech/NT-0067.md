 into repeat bookings.
Build crossside loops (buyers ↔ sellers), selfreinforcing trust loops
(verification → bookings → reviews → ranking), and content loops (feeds,
boards, case studies) --- without paywalls and without harming fairness.

A\) Principles

Value → habit: Every loop must deliver immediate value (leads, clarity,
or time saved) within a user's first 7--14 days.

Crossside by design: Features should create interactions that pull the
other side back (invites, tags, verified posts).

Trust amplifies growth: Verification, ontime behavior, and clean
delivery unlock visibility---not payment.

Polite, predictable comms: Fewer, better notifications with frequency
caps and onetap controls.

Roleaware, safe: One account, multiple roles; feeds and alerts respect
18+ Safe Mode and artisticonly policy.

B\) Lifecycle Model & Health Metrics (how we decide what to trigger)

Stages (per side):

New (days 0--7): Profile/brief created; hasn't sent a quote (seller) or
award (buyer).

Activated (days 7--30): ≥1 meaningful action (seller: Quick Quote sent;
buyer: Smart Invite/RFP sent).

Habit (30--90): ≥2 completed bookings; reply median ≤ 2h; repeat rate ≥
25%.

Risk: 14 days of inactivity and pending leads or saved searches.

Churn: 45 days no meaningful action.

Core health metrics:

Activation rate, time to first inquiry/quote/award, repeat bookings %,
time between bookings, saved search alerts → booking %, winback %.

C\) Core Loops (what pulls users back)

1\) Supplyside loops (sellers: Models/Photogs/Videographers/Creators)

Profile → Discovery → Lead → Quote → Booking → Review → Rank lift → More
Discovery

"Improve fit" hints on profile (pricefit index, missing ID, response
time) show impact estimate ("+12% more invites").

Tagging loop: after each booking, both parties can tag each other in
1--3 portfolio items; tagged approvals add those posts to both profiles
and surface to each other's followers.

Case study loop: postcompletion, onetap "Create case study" (cover + 3
images + 150 words). Case studies populate city/role showcases and boost
discovery.

Rebooking loop

Auto "Book again" button appears to the buyer 7/30/90 days after certain
packages (e.g., monthly content), prefilled with last scope + adjusted
dates.

2\) Demandside loops (buyers/brands)

Saved Search → Alert → Smart Invite/RFP → Compare → Award → Favorite →
Board revisit

Saved Searches with ANY/ALL filters (incl. social metrics, nudity tiers,
Verified/Trusted) send newmatch alerts (1/day max per search).

Board updates: when a profiled provider updates availability, gains a
badge, or posts a relevant case study, boards with that provider show a
"Fresh" chip and optional digest.

Template briefs: last 3 briefs saved as templates; 1click Reopen brief
and Rebroadcast (consumes credits per §3.5).

3\) Content loops (feeds & follow)

Follow → Feed → Inquiry → Booking → Tag → Feed

Single unified feed per user with role tabs
(Model/Photog/Vid/Creator/FanSub Creator). Posting is once, tagged by
role(s); viewers filter by role.

Feed pulls: new case studies, availability cards ("Now booking
Saturday"), touring chips ("Visiting Austin 11/20--11/22"), Verified
Studio open slots, and Verified influence posts delivered (SFW preview +
"Verified" tick).

Safe Mode default keeps 18+ content hidden until toggled; feed respects
nudity tiers & policy.

4\) Social share loop (offplatform → onplatform)

Sharecard generator: onetap export of profile/case study as socialready
images (IG/TT) with QR + booking link.

Linkinbio minisite (autogenerated) shows packages, availability, contact
CTA; UTM tags attribute inbound traffic.

5\) Verification loop (trust → visibility → bookings)

Completing ID unlocks Instant Book + DM credits → higher
inquiry→booking.

Trusted Pro (BG) grants fee nudge, RFP priority, Boost coupon → more
awards → more reviews → Rep Score up → ranking tiebreaks.
