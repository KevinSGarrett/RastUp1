create legal obligations. All examples
are illustrative and may need adaptation for jurisdiction‑specific law.

Context & Alignment: We are launching a US‑only creative marketplace
focused on models, photographers, videographers, and content creators.\
We have chosen a subscription‑free go‑to‑market with monetization via
take‑rate and optional, usage‑based promotions that are
eligibility‑gated and capped.\
Public content is artistic‑nudity‑only; Safe‑Mode defaults for guests
apply. Deliverables are transferred via external storage (Drive/Dropbox)
with immutable manifests.\
Payments flow through card (3DS where required) and ACH (with a
buyer‑fee discount); funds are escrowed and released on acceptance.\
Instant Book is gated by ID verification; background checks are opt‑in
(Trusted Pro). Feature flags and city gates are used for reversible,
auditable launches.\
Admin consoles enable Support, Trust & Safety, Finance, and Ops to
perform routine tasks without code changes.

Goals:\
• Define our legal and policy posture for a US‑only launch with
city‑by‑city rollout.\
• Codify risk appetites and red lines for content, payments, privacy,
and safety.\
• Make policies actionable with owners, flags, and admin tools.

Scope & Applicability:\
Applies to all users, providers, buyers, and studios operating on the
platform within the United States. Covers all public content, bookings,
payments, and messaging conducted via the platform or its official
communication channels.

Definitions (plain language):\
• Artistic nudity: non‑sexualized nudity for artistic purposes; explicit
sexual content is prohibited on public surfaces.\
• Instant Book: a booking that can be accepted immediately; available
only to ID‑verified providers.\
• Trusted Pro: an opt‑in background‑checked provider with additional
safety signals and minor fee incentives.\
• Escrow: funds held by the processor until acceptance of deliverables
or completion of studio checkout.\
• Safe‑Mode: default media setting for guests and first‑time viewers;
suppresses sensitive thumbnails.

Policy Statements:\
• US‑only: we contract under US law; we will not knowingly onboard users
domiciled outside the US at launch.\
• Age limitation: the platform is for adults (18+). No minors may create
accounts or appear in content.\
• Artistic‑only public surfaces: explicit sexual content is prohibited
on public search, profile cards, and feeds.\
• Identity diligence: ID verification is required for Instant Book and
recommended for all sellers.\
• Background checks: optional and consent‑based; adverse‑action steps
follow FCRA norms.\
• Payments & escrow: use approved processors; no cash off‑platform
payments are permitted via our UI.\
• Privacy & PII: minimize collected data; mask PII by default; use a
vault for sensitive identifiers.\
• Accessibility & fairness: commit to WCAG 2.1 AA and to
non‑discrimination in access to services.\
• Law enforcement: we respond to valid legal process and emergencies
with audit trails and privacy guards.

Procedures & Operational Playbooks:\
• Policy change protocol: draft → legal review → feature flag → city
gate → limited launch → measurement → GA.\
• Incident triage: classify by severity (user harm, money, privacy);
invoke on‑call roles and runbooks.\
• Document lifecycle: version external policies; keep internal playbooks
aligned and dated with owners.

Enforcement & Remedies:\
• Tiered enforcement: warnings, temporary limits, removal of content,
account holds, or permanent disable.\
• Appeals: structured process with timelines; decisions documented;
patterns reviewed for fairness.\
• Chargebacks & disputes: represent with receipts, chats, manifests,
releases; escalate only within policy.

Data, Privacy & Retention:\
• PII as least‑privilege: mask until unmask reason is given; audit
access; limit retention to business needs.\
• Evidence retention: keep contracts/releases 7 years; keep booking
receipts by finance policy.\
• Data localization: US‑region storage onl
