nders; incident bridges
pre‑arranged for Sev‑1/Sev‑0. • Co‑Marketing Discipline: Announce after
pilots prove value; enforce clear success metrics; align PR/brand tone
with our artistic‑only policy. • Support & Playbooks: Create
partner‑specific macros; train Support/Trust on integration quirks; log
incidents with partner tags. • Measurement: Attribute partner impact in
§5 dashboards (e.g., ACH share by vendor, IDV completion rate by
provider, studio attach from verified partners). • Contracts: Avoid
exclusivity unless compensated; require termination rights, data
return/delete clauses, and uptime credits for SLA misses. • City
Sequencing: Some partners launch in founding cities only; we gate by
city to manage operational readiness. • Accessibility & Inclusion:
Ensure partner widgets meet WCAG 2.1 AA; provide text alternatives and
keyboard navigation.\
• Ethics & Brand Safety: Decline partners whose practices conflict with
user safety or our policy posture; include an ethics review in intake.

Partnerships Disclaimer: This is an internal planning document for
partner strategy and ecosystem development. It does not create
commitments. All integrations ship behind flags, follow privacy
policies, and require vendor due diligence, DPAs, SLAs, and legal
review. Commercial terms are illustrative until negotiated.

Context & Alignment: US‑only marketplace at launch; subscription‑free;
monetization via take‑rate and capped, eligibility‑gated usage‑based
promotions. Public content is artistic‑only with Safe‑Mode on for
guests. Deliverables flow via external links (Drive/Dropbox) with
immutable manifests; escrow releases on acceptance. Instant Book is
gated by ID verification; background checks are opt‑in (Trusted Pro).
Rollouts are city‑gated behind feature flags; Admin Console enforces
least‑privilege, JIT elevation, two‑person approvals, immutable audits,
and kill‑switches.

Goals:\
• Stabilize checkout and payouts with best‑in‑class rails; reduce costs
with ACH; keep tax correct with allowlists.\
• Ensure reversibility with multi‑processor readiness and clear
fallbacks.

Target partner segments:\
• Primary processor (card + escrow + payouts); backup processor
(failover).\
• ACH partner (bank linking, returns handling); payout bank for fast
transfers.\
• Tax engine for US‑only allowlists; receipt itemization; refund/credit
memos.

Mutual value proposition:\
• Higher checkout success; lower processor costs via ACH; predictable
payouts improve supply retention.\
• Tax correctness reduces support noise and financial exposure.

Selection criteria & due diligence:\
• Card + 3DS support; dispute webhooks; idempotent APIs; strong uptime
SLAs.\
• ACH verification options (instant + micro‑deposits); returns codes;
fee transparency.\
• Tax engine coverage by state/city; latency; sandbox; post‑outage
reconciliation.

Integration scopes & surfaces (what we build):\
• Checkout: card auth/capture, ACH debit, split fees; escrow ledger;
refunds; receipts.\
• Payouts: bank connect (KYC/KYB); reserves; Early Payout; failure
retry; ledger export.\
• Tax: quote at checkout; amended receipts; deposit taxation for studios
later.

Commercial & legal patterns (illustrative):\
• Interchange‑plus or blended %; ACH per‑debit fee; volume tiers after
City 2; uptime credits.\
• Tax engine per‑call pricing; annual plan negotiated after stability.

Enablement & co‑marketing (how we launch together):\
• Sandbox QA matrices; synthetic test cards and ACH returns; outage
drills; status page hooks.\
• Buyer ACH discount messaging; deposit vs charge line items; daily
close reconciliation playbook.

Top risks & mitigations:\
• Processor outage; ACH returns spike; tax misquote; payout queue
stuck.\
• Vendor lock‑in and unexpected price increases.

Operational playbooks (summary):\
• Switch to fallback processor;
