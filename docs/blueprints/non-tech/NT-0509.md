 matrices; synthetic test cards and ACH returns; outage
drills; status page hooks.\
• Buyer ACH discount messaging; deposit vs charge line items; daily
close reconciliation playbook.

Top risks & mitigations:\
• Processor outage; ACH returns spike; tax misquote; payout queue
stuck.\
• Vendor lock‑in and unexpected price increases.

Operational playbooks (summary):\
• Switch to fallback processor; prefer ACH; pause promos; reconcile
after.\
• Allowlist bypass for affected state taxes; amend post‑recovery;
transparent user messaging.

Owners & RACI:\
• Payments PM/Eng, Finance, Tax PM, SRE, Support.

KPIs & leading indicators:\
• Checkout success; ACH adoption; payout latency; settlement variance;
tax quote success/latency; dispute win rate.

Acceptance criteria (ready / successful when):\
✓ 14 days of green daily close; staged rollout in one city; outage drill
passed; ACH share ≥ target.

Timeline & checkpoints:\
• Pilot in Houston alpha/beta; enable in Dallas/Austin after GA
stability; quarterly renegotiation checkpoints.

Scenario Playbook --- ACH incentive confusion:\
Trigger: Buyer fee complaints despite ACH link.\
Response: Clarify UI copy; ensure fee reduction applied only on
successful ACH; add help‑center article.\
Legal/Comms: In‑checkout tooltip; follow‑up email, support macro.\
Roll‑back/Forward: N/A\
Owner: Payments PM \| Telemetry: ACH adoption, buyer fee refunds \|
Evidence: Screenshots, receipt diffs, support transcripts

Implementation Notes:\
• Partner Governance: Maintain a single source of truth for partner
status (prospect, NDA, pilot, GA), contacts, contracts, scopes, and
SLAs. Tag all features behind partner flags and city gates to avoid
blast‑radius mistakes. • Privacy & Data: Apply least‑data
principles---only request scopes needed for the user value; rotate
tokens; revoke access on inactivity. • Security & Audits: Vendor
SOC/pentest reports stored with expiry reminders; incident bridges
pre‑arranged for Sev‑1/Sev‑0. • Co‑Marketing Discipline: Announce after
pilots prove value; enforce clear success metrics; align PR/brand tone
with our artistic‑only policy. • Support & Playbooks: Create
partner‑specific macros; train Support/Trust on integration quirks; log
incidents with partner tags. • Measurement: Attribute partner impact in
§5 dashboards (e.g., ACH share by vendor, IDV completion rate by
provider, studio attach from verified partners). • Contracts: Avoid
exclusivity unless compensated; require termination rights, data
return/delete clauses, and uptime credits for SLA misses. • City
Sequencing: Some partners launch in founding cities only; we gate by
city to manage operational readiness. • Accessibility & Inclusion:
Ensure partner widgets meet WCAG 2.1 AA; provide text alternatives and
keyboard navigation.\
• Ethics & Brand Safety: Decline partners whose practices conflict with
user safety or our policy posture; include an ethics review in intake.
