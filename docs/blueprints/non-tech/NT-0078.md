J\) Critical Empty States & Skeletons

Search empty: show relaxfilters tips, nearby neighborhoods, role switch.

Profile with no packages: onboarding card "Create your first package."

Studio with no slots: prompt to add schedule; hide IB until set.

Boards empty: prompt to add from search; suggest saved search.

Delivery Room empty: manifest placeholder; externallink guidance.

Support center empty: point to KB and mostused selfserve flows.

K\) Acceptance Criteria (mark §4.0 FINAL)

All pages above have defined routes, owners, key sections, and primary
CTAs.

Studios exist as: /studios hub, /studio/{slug} detail, Create/Edit,
Dashboard, and AttachinFlow drawer.

Linked Booking Group has a dedicated checkout summary and refund outcome
presentation.

Safe Mode is globally present; FanSubscription Creator routes are gated;
studios remain visible (SFW only).

Delivery Room, Smart Docs, and Support flows are reachable from
bookings.

Buyer, Seller, Host, and Admin surfaces cover onboarding → booking →
delivery → review → dispute without dead ends.

Modals/drawers defined for all timesensitive tasks (attach, quote,
reschedule, claims).

City ops & promotions admin routes exist to tune CPC floors, featured
pricing, and city launch flags.

L\) Why this Page Map works

Nothing missing: Every accepted feature from Sections 1--3 has a page, a
route, and a CTA.

People vs Places clarity: Service Profiles vs Studios are cleanly
separated yet connect via AttachinFlow.

Launchable & scalable: Focuses on Houstonfirst while keeping the IA
ready for multicity expansion and future categories.

Trust & safety are visible: Docs, deposits, checkin/out, and dispute
paths are firstclass---not hidden.

§4.1 --- Global Information Architecture & Navigation

Contract: Make it obvious where to go for any task. Keep People vs
Places distinct in IA, keep city & Safe Mode always available, and keep
create actions contextual (buyer vs seller vs host). All navigation
choices must support the Houstonfirst rollout and scale to multicity.
