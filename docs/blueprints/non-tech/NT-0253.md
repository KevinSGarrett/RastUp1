hashes and immutable links; redact PII in
views; never edit originals; legal holds override deletion where

• Copy Clarity: explain outcomes and next steps; avoid citing laws in
emails; link to help‑center with examples.\
• Training: quarterly refreshers for T&S, Support, Finance; FCRA basics;
chargeback representment; accessibility etiquette.\
• Measurement: we track leading/lagging indicators to tune thresholds
and staffing.

Implementation Notes:\
• Feature Flags & City Gates: externally visible policy toggles ship
behind flags; Admin can rollback with a two‑step confirmation; events
are audited.\
• Admin Operability: every rule has a corresponding tool in Admin
(approve/deny/redact/pause/escalate) with immutable logs.\
• Evidence Hygiene: store hashes and immutable links; redact PII in
views; never edit originals; legal holds override deletion where
applicable.\

Disclaimer: This document is a policy and process blueprint intended for
product and operations planning. It does not constitute legal, tax, or
compliance advice. Consult qualified counsel before publishing external
policies or taking actions that create legal obligations. All examples
are illustrative and may need adaptation for jurisdiction‑specific law.

Context & Alignment: We are launching a US‑only creative marketplace
focused on models, photographers, videographers, and content creators.\
We have chosen a subscription‑free go‑to‑market with monetization via
take‑rate and optional, usage‑based promotions that are
eligibility‑gated and capped.\
Public content is artistic‑nudity‑only; Safe‑Mode defaults for guests
apply. Deliverables are transferred via external storage (Drive/Dropbox)
with immutable manifests.\
Payments flow through card (3DS where required) and ACH (with a
buyer‑fee discount); funds are escrowed and released on acceptance.\
Instant Book is gated by ID verification; background checks are opt‑in
(Trusted Pro). Feature flags and city gates are used for reversible,
auditable launches.\
Admin consoles enable Support, Trust & Safety, Finance, and Ops to
perform routine tasks without code changes.

Goals:\
• Publish clear, coherent, and non‑surprising public policies users can
read and act on.\
• Align the ToS with product realities: escrow, Instant Book, studio
deposits, promotions, and Safe‑Mode.\
• Ensure Privacy Policy and AUP reflect data minimization and
artistic‑only public content.

Scope & Applicability:\
Applies to every registered and guest user who accesses the site, mobile
pages, or official communication channels. The ToS governs contractual
relationships; the Privacy Policy explains data practices; the AUP sets
behavioral rules.

Definitions (plain language):\
• User Content: media and text a user uploads or posts to the platform.\
• License: limited license users grant to display, host, and transmit
their content for platform features.\
• Escrowed Transaction: a booking where funds are held until completion
conditions are met.\
• Dispute: a disagreement over deliverables, attendance, or rules that
invokes support or chargeback processes.

Policy Statements:\
• Contract formation: ToS acceptance on signup; changes notified;
continued use indicates acceptance.\
• Eligibility: 18+, US resident; no minors in content; no use where
prohibited by law.\
• Fees & payment: buyer service fee, provider fee, taxes, deposits; all
itemized; off‑platform payment encouragement prohibited.\
• Escrow specifics: timing of charges/holds; release triggers;
cancellation and r
