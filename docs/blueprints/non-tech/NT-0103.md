cheduling polls, Quick
Quote; SafeMode filtering for previews.

Quick Actions live and policyaware: Quick Quote, Propose Reschedule,
Change Order, Issue Refund/Discount, Studio Access, PostBooking
Adjustment.

LBGaware features: group bar, Broadcast, synchronized reschedules with
split option.

Read receipts, typing, pin, archive, inbox filters/search delivered; DM
credit spend only on first outbound of new threads.

Safety: offplatform detection, harassment filter, virus scan,
block/mute/report; personal contact hidden prebooking; access codes
masked until esign.

Evidence autoattached: docs, delivery links, checkin/out, receipts;
system messages for every action.

Time zone clarity in proposals and timestamps; ICS updated on
reschedule.

Performance: optimistic sends, retry, upload progress; telemetry fires
as listed.

N\) Why this works

Fewer support touches: The thread is a control panel---quotes,
reschedules, refunds, and adjustments live where the conversation
happens.

Safer & cleaner: Guardrails reduce fraud and harassment without blocking
legit coordination.

LBG clarity without confusion: Keep bookings separate for policy/payout,
yet coordinate via Group Broadcast and synchronized changes.

Frictionlight: Replies are free; credits only gate outbound cold
outreach, which protects buyers and keeps the inbox healthy.

§4.10 --- Reviews & Reputation UX

Goal: Make feedback trustworthy, fair, and hard to game---so buyers can
choose confidently and providers/hosts know what to improve. Keep
reviews rolescoped for People and spacescoped for Studios. Use a
transparent 0--100 Reputation Score that's explainable, timeweighted,
and tied to real outcomes (ontime delivery, noshow rate, safety).
Respect Safe Mode, privacy, and legal boundaries.

A\) Principles

Only from real jobs: Public star/text reviews come only from completed,
onplatform bookings (verified by escrow + acceptance).

Doubleblind & timeboxed: Neither side sees the other's review until both
submit or the window closes.

Role/space scoped: Reviews and reputation never mix across roles;
studios have their own reputation.

Evidence beats rhetoric: Where relevant, the UI shows objective signals
(checkin/out, delivery timestamps, UGC minlive pass).

Safety first: Provide a private safety feedback channel separate from
public reviews; enforce antiharassment and antidoxxing rules.

Explain the math: The Reputation Score always has a "Why this score?"
breakdown and decay timeline.

B\) Triggers & Windows

Trigger to review:

Talent bookings: on Acceptance or Autoaccept in Delivery Room.

Studios: at checkout complete (after checkout time passes and no open
access issue).

Window: 14 days from trigger for both parties.

Doubleblind: Reviews publish when both are submitted or at day 14; if
only one submits, both publish at day 14.

Reminders: Day 3, Day 10 nudges; Day13 last call (inapp + email).

Who can review: The buyer and the counterparty (provider or host). No
thirdparty public reviews.

Canceled jobs:

Provider/hostfault cancel: no star review; system records a reliability
penalty visible in the Rep breakdown.

Buyerfault cancel: same (penalty on buyer account; not public).

Noshow: no star review; a Noshow marker feeds reputation (decays).
