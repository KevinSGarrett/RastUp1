rcial / Ads / Exclusive /
Buyout) with transparent pricing.

D\) Instant Book / Smart Invites / Autoaccept (final)

Instant Book (optin):

Talent defines rules: which packages, price minimum, travel radius, date
windows, advancenotice buffer.

If the buyer's request matches, they can book instantly (escrow charged;
calendar autoblocked; chat opens for details).

Talent can cap daily/weekly instant bookings to avoid overload.

Smart Invites (private, not a job board):

A buyer selects up to N profiles and sends a single invite (shared
brief, proposed date/time/package, budget).

Each recipient receives a private request; the buyer can award 1 slot
(first to accept or manual choose) or multiple slots for team shoots.

Prevents broadcast spam; keeps everything 1to1.

Autoaccept (for highdemand users):

Talent can set autoaccept rules (e.g., "autoaccept Standard or Premium
packages ≥ \$X, weekday 10am--2pm, within 10 miles").

Perfect for highfollower users who don't want backandforth.

Payment is captured on accept; cancellation rules apply.

These three together eliminate the "manual chase" for both lowfollower
buyers (instant transactions) and highfollowertohighfollower pairings
(autoaccept + Smart Invites).

E\) Social metrics (productized)

Connect Socials (any role):

Instagram (Creator/Business): followers_count, recent media stats, and
Insights where permissioned.

YouTube: subscriberCount, views, watch time via Data/Analytics APIs.

TikTok: Display/authorized user info (follower counts where scopes
permit).

OnlyFans: link only (no live metrics---no official public API).

Verification levels:

Verified Social (connected): metrics shown, appear in Verifiedonly
filters.

Unverified (selfreported): labeled clearly; excluded when buyers toggle
"Verified only."

How we compute "engagement rate":

IG: avg(likes+comments) on last 12 feed posts ÷ followers.

TikTok: avg views/likes on last 20 public videos ÷ followers (show both
ER and avg views).

YouTube: avg views per video last 20 ÷ subscribers (plus shorts vs
nonshorts disclosure).\
(Exact formulas displayed in "ⓘ" tooltips on the filter panel.)

Freshness & load:

Nightly sync; manual refresh up to 3×/day per platform (ratelimited).

We store daily snapshots to calculate 30/90day growth and show a trend
sparkline.

Privacy: users choose which platforms to show and which metrics to index
in search.

F\) NSFW & OnlyFans (launch rules)

Allowed: SFW and artistic nudity (nonexplicit), behind an NSFW toggle;
18+ verified users only.

Disallowed: explicit sexual content, pornographic acts,
escorting/services.

OF creators welcome: can link OF; onsite portfolio must follow our
rules; no live OF metrics.

Why: Stripe/PayPal restrictions on adult content; this path preserves
mainstream payments and brandsafe growth.

G\) Feed (singlecompose, multitag)

Creators post once and tag one or more roles.

Follower preferences: when following, users choose which role tags they
want to see; feed shows relevant posts once (deduped).

On profile, Posts defaults to the active role tab; toggle "All roles."

H\) Acceptance criteria (updated)

Rolefirst search with final role filters above.

Verifiedonly social filters work for IG/YouTube/TikTok when connected;
Unverified stats clearly labeled and excluded by default.

Every SP has ≥1 package or a base rate; extras optional.

Instant Book, Smart Invites, and Autoaccept function as specified.

NSFW policy enforced (artistic nudity gated; explicit disallowed); OF
linking allowed.

Singlecompose, multitag feed with follower role preferences and dedupe.

Implementation notes (brief)

Search index: Each Service Profile is its own document; social metrics
fields are written only for Verified Social accounts (with a usertoggle
to include/exclude unverified numbers in search results).

Metrics storage: Perplatform table of daily snapshots → compute 30/90day
growth and ER.

UI copy: On filters, add "ⓘ Verified by platform connection"; on
unverified, "ⓘ Sel
