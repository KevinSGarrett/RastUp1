recognition).

Commercial & legal patterns (illustrative):\
• Non‑financial in most cases; mutual promotion; event co‑sponsorship;
limited grants for founding programs.

Enablement & co‑marketing (how we launch together):\
• Campus starter kit; deck and curriculum; checklist for faculty; event
playbook; creator ambassador program.

Top risks & mitigations:\
• Overhead vs. ROI; policy misunderstandings; reputational risk if
program faces controversy.

Operational playbooks (summary):\
• Pilot small; measure outcomes; keep content apolitical; focus on craft
and safety; pause if controversy arises.

Owners & RACI:\
• Community lead, City Ops, Trust, Marketing.

KPIs & leading indicators:\
• Signups and activation from partner programs; time‑to‑first booking;
retention; safety incident rates among cohorts.

Acceptance criteria (ready / successful when):\
✓ At least 2 partner programs per city; workshops delivered; measurable
activation and safety improvements.

Timeline & checkpoints:\
• Begin in Houston beta; expand to Dallas/Austin; annual refresh of
materials.

Scenario Playbook --- Low activation from partner school:\
Trigger: Few bookings post‑workshop\
Response: Follow‑up coaching; pairing with studios; featured carousel
for graduates; refine curriculum.\
Legal/Comms: Newsletter spotlight; mentor program invitations.\
Roll‑back/Forward: Scale back if outcomes remain weak.\
Owner: Community lead \| Telemetry: activation_rate,
time_to_first_booking \| Evidence: Attendance, portfolio quality reviews

Implementation Notes:\
• Partner Governance: Maintain a single source of truth for partner
status (prospect, NDA, pilot, GA), contacts, contracts, scopes, and
SLAs. Tag all features behind partner flags and city gates to avoid
blast‑radius mistakes. • Privacy & Data: Apply least‑data
principles---only request scopes needed for the user value; rotate
tokens; revoke access on inactivity. • Security & Audits: Vendor
SOC/pentest reports stored with expiry reminders; incident bridges
pre‑arranged for Sev‑1/Sev‑0. • Co‑Marketing Discipline: Announce after
pilots prove value; enforce clear success metrics; align PR/brand tone
with our artistic‑only policy. • Support & Playbooks: Create
partner‑specific macros; train Support/Trust on integration quirks; log
incidents with partner tags. • Measurement: Attribute partner impact in
§5 dashboards (e.g., ACH share by vendor, IDV completion rate by
provider, studio attach from verified partners). • Contracts: Avoid
exclusivity unless compensated; require termination rights, data
return/delete clauses, and uptime credits for SLA misses. • City
Sequencing: Some partners launch in founding cities only; we gate by
city to manage operational readiness. • Accessibility & Inclusion:
Ensure partner widgets meet WCAG 2.1 AA; provide text alternatives and
keyboard navigation.\
• Ethics & Brand Safety: Decline partners whose practices conflict with
user safety or our policy posture; include an ethics review in intake.
