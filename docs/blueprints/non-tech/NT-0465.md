g herein creates external commitments.

Context & Alignment: US‑only creative marketplace; subscription‑free at
launch; monetization via take‑rate and usage‑based promotions with
eligibility gates and strict caps; public content limited to
artistic‑only (guest Safe‑Mode on by default); deliverables handled via
external links (Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests; escrowed
payments released on acceptance; Instant Book gated by ID verification;
optional background checks confer Trusted Pro; city‑gated rollout with
feature flags; strong Admin Console with least‑privilege, JIT elevation,
two‑person approvals, and immutable audits.

Timeframe & Scope:\
• T+90 to T+150 (post‑beta, same city).

Goals:\
• Turn on promotions v1 with caps and holdouts; prove ≥2.5× ROAS without
harming organic search.\
• Stabilize money ops: ACH discount live; tax allowlist expanded where
ready; Early Payout per‑use live for high‑rep providers.\
• Harden safety and admin workflows for scale.

Product Themes:\
• Add monetization carefully; keep fairness and trust standards intact.

Workstreams & Deliverables:\
• Search Boost (CPC floors by role/city) + Featured (weekly) with
labels, caps, QS, and holdouts; invalid‑click auto‑credits.\
• Payments & tax: ACH discount messaging; allowlist expansion (if
ready); amended receipts; daily close automation.\
• Early Payout per‑use (eligibility Rep ≥ 85 + IDV); reserve rules;
payout ledger improvements.\
• Safety: harassment tooling, doxxing macro, stricter rate limits for
new accounts; appeals capacity.

Feature Flags & City Gates:\
• feature.promotions.v1, feature.early_payout,
feature.tax.allowlist.{more_states}, feature.payout.reserve.rules.

Dependencies & Inputs:\
• Growth analytics; finance dashboards; Trust staffing; support macros;
status page templates.

Top Risks & Mitigations:\
• Pay‑to‑win perception; invalid clicks; tax variance; payout queue
stuck; support overload.

Instrumentation & KPIs:\
• Promotions adoption; ROAS; invalid‑click credit %; organic KPIs
steady; payout latency; tax variance; support SLA.

Acceptance Criteria (Go/No‑Go):\
✓ ROAS median ≥ 2.5×; organic KPIs steady; daily close green 14 days;
Early Payout error rate ≤ target.

Staffing & Ownership:\
• Growth PM, Finance, Payments Eng, Trust, Support, Data, SRE.

Milestones & Checkpoints:\
• GA announcement; case studies; Featured carousels; ROAS report;
partner recap.

Implementation Notes:\
• Flag Discipline: Each capability ships behind a named flag with a
runbook, owner, rollback, and blast‑radius notes. Flags default to
\'off\' in new cities.\
• Admin Operability: No workstream is \'done\' until admin tools enable
Support/Trust/Finance to handle the top 3 edge cases without
engineering.\
• Copy & Policy: All flows have help‑center articles and email/SMS
templates; copy avoids legalese and links to policy examples.\
• QA & Drills: Staging mimics production data shapes; drills include
processor/tax outages, moderation surges, and incident command
handoffs.\
• Experimentation: Features that affect marketplace economics (ranking,
boosts, fees) include holdouts and guardrails; we measure incremental
impact.\
• Data Wiring: Events land in Bronze/Silver/Gold (§5); KPIs pull only
from Gold with freshness SLOs. Definitions live in a metrics catalog.\
• Accessibility: New UI complies with WCAG 2.1 AA; screen‑reader and
keyboard paths verified; contrast ratios checked; defects triaged.\
• Security & Privacy: PII masked by default; JIT elevation for sensitive
admin actions; vendor scopes minimal; audits immutable.\
• City Readiness: City‑first artifacts (press kit, creator ambassadors,
studio partners) prepared in §10.1 runbook.\
• Post‑Launch: 7/30/90‑day reviews convert observations into roadmap
changes; flags let us tune by city without forks.
