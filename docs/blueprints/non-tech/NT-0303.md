itization: high‑risk tasks take precedence during
incident weeks; low‑risk items may defer with approval.

Enforcement & Remedies:\
• Data hygiene: purge jobs verified; evidence repositories trimmed;
legal holds reviewed and released when resolved.\
• Privacy: DSR volume monitored; training refreshers scheduled; secrets
rotation logged.

Data, Privacy & Retention:\
• Templates: quarterly review checklist; RBAC access review form; vendor
questionnaire; DR drill script; SOC evidence index.\
• Dashboards: compliance status board; upcoming deadlines; error budgets
for misses.

Templates & Required Notices (internal/external):\
• Task completion rate; on‑time rate; audit findings; vendor remediation
rates; incident reduction post‑reviews.

Compliance Metrics & Audits:\
• Calendar sprawl → consolidate and assign DRIs; drift between policy
and product → tie reviews to release trains.\
• Vendor fatigue → rotate deep‑dives; keep a minimal baseline
questionnaire for low‑risk vendors.

Risks & Mitigations:\
• Calendar published; owners and backups named; first cycle completed
with notes; dashboard showing green/yellow/red for each area.
