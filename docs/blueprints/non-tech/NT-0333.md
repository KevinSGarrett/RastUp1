Financial Modeling Disclaimer: This section provides planning
assumptions, formulas, and structures for internal modeling. It is not a
forecast or financial advice. All sample numbers are illustrative;
replace with real inputs once telemetry in §5 is live.

Context & Alignment: We operate a US‑only creative marketplace
connecting models, photographers, videographers, and content creators
with buyers and studios. Launch strategy is subscription‑free;
monetization is via take‑rate on bookings and usage‑based promotions
(capped, labeled, eligibility‑gated). Public content is artistic‑only;
deliverables use external storage with immutable manifests. Instant Book
requires ID verification; background checks are opt‑in (Trusted Pro).
ACH reduces buyer fee to 3% where enabled. Feature flags and city gates
control rollout; admin tools and audits turn policy into software.

Goals:\
• Provide a 24‑month P&L structure with three scenarios tied to city
launches and product milestones.\
• Make it easy to update with real telemetry and to communicate to
stakeholders.\
• Ensure cash planning reflects realistic opex and COGS envelopes.

Key variables & baselines:\
• Horizon: 24 months from launch; quarterly checkpoints for board
updates.\
• Scenarios: Conservative (slower adoption), Base (plan), Aggressive
(faster promos ROI and ACH uptake).\
• City timing: Houston GA by \~Month 6; City‑2 Month 9; City‑3 Month 12
(if §6.4 gates pass).

Core formulas (structure; plug real telemetry later):\
• Revenue_t = ProviderFees_t + BuyerFees_t + Promotions_t\
• COGS_t = Processor_t + TrustSafety_t + TaxEngine_t + Comms_t +
Chargeback_t\
• GrossMargin_t = Revenue_t − COGS_t\
• Opex_t = Payroll_t + VendorOpex_t + Facilities_t + Misc_t\
• EBITDA_t = GrossMargin_t − Opex_t\
• Cash_t = Cash\_{t−1} + EBITDA_t − Capex_t

Scenario deltas:\
The aggressive case assumes higher ACH adoption (→ lower processing cost
but slightly lower buyer fee), higher promotions adoption with
sustainable ROAS, and faster IDV/Trusted Pro uptake improving
conversion.

Communication:\
We present scenarios as ranges with narrative drivers rather than
single‑point forecasts. Board updates highlight which drivers moved and
why.

Updating cadence:\
Monthly actuals roll into the model; quarterly we re‑baseline scenario
envelopes to maintain credibility.

Instrumentation & success metrics:\
• GMV growth by city; take‑rate mix; promotions revenue share; processor
cost as % of collections\
• Gross margin %; opex ratio; EBITDA trajectory; runway months at
current burn

Top risks & mitigations:\
• Optimism bias → keep conservative case plausible and funded; treat
aggressive as upside-only\
• Uncontrolled opex → hiring frozen until milestones; vendor renewals
scrutinized\
• City launch slips → build schedule slack; emphasize quality signals
before spend

Acceptance checklist:\
□ Scenario workbook built with inputs linked to §5 Gold tables.\
□ Quarterly board pack template prepared with red/yellow/green on key
drivers.\
□ Runway calculator validated with cash reconciliation.

Modeling Deep‑Dive:\
• Scenario setup: Define a city cohort with starting supply and demand,
apply search→inquiry and inquiry→booking rates from §6.2/§6.3, then
layer on cancellations, lateness, and chargebacks. Compute GMV per
cohort and pass it through fee structure, taxes, and processor costs.\
• Unit economics: For a representative \$X booking, compute provider fee
(12%), buyer fee (5% or 3% with ACH), and processing cost. Show platform
net before variable ops (content safety scans, IDV/BG subsidies). Repeat
for small (≤\$150), mid (\$300--\$600), and large (\>\$1,000) bookings.\
• Promotions ROI: Using holdouts, estimate incremental GMV from paid
exposure. Attribute revenue to promotio
