ay one: buyer fee largely covers card processing;
smallorder min prevents negative unit economics; ACH discount reduces
payment costs and attracts highervalue buyers.

Growthpositive: discounts for Instant Book and Trusted Pro increase
conversion and safety; highvalue tier encourages larger jobs to stay
onplatform (a pattern users recognize from legacy fee ladders).

Addendum to §3.1 / §3.2 --- Policy & Pricing Notes (Storage & Docs)

Storage policy copy (customerfacing): "We store review copies and
paperwork for 12 months. Originals stay in your Drive/Dropbox. We're not
a longterm archive."

No storage fees at launch (per §3.2 StartFree strategy); external
hosting required for large deliverables.

Document access: Signed docs are always downloadable; we maintain copies
even if external links expire.

Dispute window: Contracts define a posting/delivery dispute window
(e.g., 7--14 days) during which links must remain live.

Addendum --- §3.1 Core Monetization Mechanics (Studios) --- FINAL

Goal: Apply our simple, trusted pricing (12% provider / 5% buyer) to
Studio bookings without ambiguity. Keep deposits outside GMV, align
refunds with studio policies, and preserve clean ledgers for Linked
Booking Groups (talent + studio in one checkout).

A\) What we charge on a Studio booking

Provider (host) fee: 12% of the studio subtotal

Subtotal = hourly rental × booked hours + cleaning fee + paid addons
(e.g., furniture move)

Excludes taxes and deposit holds.

Buyer service fee: 5% of the studio subtotal (min \$3)

ACH discount (when enabled): buyer fee 3% (min \$3) if the buyer pays
via ACH.

Refund of buyer fee follows fault: refunded on hostfault cancel;
nonrefundable on buyer cancel per policy.

Processing costs: paid from platform take (same as talent).

No change to talent fees. Talent and Studio fees are computed on their
respective subtotals, even when purchased together.

B\) Discounts & nudges (studio)

Instant Book discount applies to Studio bookings: --1% on the provider
fee for IB transactions.

Trusted Pro (background) is peopleonly; does not apply to Studio hosts.

Highvalue tier: the 10% provider fee above \$1,000 threshold applies per
booking (talent and studio evaluated separately).

City promos (timeboxed) may separately reduce buyer/provider fees on
studio bookings; configured per city cohort.

C\) What we do not charge on studios

Damage deposits (card holds) are not GMV; we do not take a platform fee
on deposit captures.

Postbooking damage captures (if approved) pass through to host; the
platform may still incur processor fees.

Tips (if we enable them for hosts) remain 0% platform fee.

D\) Adjustments that are feeable

Overtime, crewsize overages, ruleviolation fees (when upheld) are
treated as booking adjustments → included in studio subtotal and feeable
at the same provider/buyer fee rates.

Change orders that extend hours or add paid items → feeable (computed at
approval time).

E\) Linked Booking Groups (talent + studio in one checkout)

We create two bookings (one talent, one studio) under a Linked Group ID.

Fees are computed per booking; buyer sees a unified receipt with two
sections (Talent • Studio).

Refunds/reversals apply per booking based on each policy; the group
summary presents the net outcome.

Processing may be a single charge or split under the hood; the ledger
remains separated to keep fee math transparent.

F\) Refund policy alignment (studio vs talent)

Studio cancels (hostfault): 100% refund of studio charges; buyer service
fee for that booking refunded; goodwill credit per §3.9.

Buyer cancels: follow the studio matrix (e.g., \>7 days = 100%, 7--48h =
50%, \<48h = 0%); buyer fee nonrefundable.

Noshow (buyer at studio): host paid per matrix; buyer fee nonrefundable.

Force majeure/safety: platform may waive fees and refund appropriately
(studio and/or talent) per §3.9.
