d),
Dispute rate, Response time (median).

Verified references counter: number of completed onplatform
collaborations.

For buyers: a Buyer Rep panel is shown to providers (see §H).

Search cards include: Rep Score ring, average rating, count, last90day
ontime %, and badges.

E\) Reputation Score (0--100) --- computation & decay (refined)

Purpose: A quick, explainable trust signal; used in ranking as a
tiebreak (never overrides relevance/filters) and to gate certain
privileges (e.g., Boost eligibility, Instant Book).

Inputs & weights (roleaware; timeweighted):

Reviews & volume --- 40%

Bayesianadjusted average of overall star ratings (per role) using a
Wilson score prior, with recency weighting (last 90 days ×1.5).

Reliability & policy --- 25%

Ontime start %, completion rate, noshow/cancel strikes (negative weights
with decay), doc compliance before checkin.

Responsiveness --- 10%

Median first response time; reply rate to invites/RFP.

Verifications --- 15%

ID (base), Trusted Pro (+), Studio Verified (+), SocialVerified (+
small).

Recent performance --- 10%

Last 90day job NPS ("Would you book again?" Yes/No), dispute outcomes.

Decay & floors:

Strikes and poor events decay 25% per 90 days of clean activity.

New accounts show "New --- building reputation" until ≥3 verified
reviews (prevents low initial scores).

Gaming protection:

Volume weighting cap: one job cannot change score by \>3 pts.

Reciprocal review detection: correlated 5star exchanges get
downweighted.

Anomaly flags: suspicious IP/device overlaps; cluster analysis for ring
behavior; autoaudit queue.

F\) Incentives & achievements (behavior shaping)

Universal (roleagnostic):

Complete your first 3 jobs on time → "OnTime Streak" badge + +10 DM
credits.

\<1hour median response for 30 days → "Fast Responder" badge + search
tiebreak +1 (only in equal matches).

Complete ID → Instant Book + +20 DM credits.

Trusted Pro → Provider fee --0.5%, RFP priority, \$15 Boost coupon (per
§3.3).

Studio Verified → appears in studio filter; prioritized in "Studios in
\[City\]" carousels.

Rolespecific bonus nudges (examples):

Models/Creators: "Boundary Pro" (5 bookings with 'Safety & Comfort'
≥4.8) → profile highlight chip.

Photographers/Videographers: "Spec Perfect" (10 jobs with 100% manifest
pass, ≤1 revision) → small search nudge in equal ties.

FanSubscription Creators: "Promo Deliveries 10/10" (all posts verified
within window) → featured eligibility in "Reliable Promo" carousel.

Review completion incentives (neutral):

Completing any review within window → +5 DM credits (regardless of
rating).

No incentives for positive ratings (to avoid bias).

G\) Antigaming, moderation & appeals

Content policy filters: NLP and rulebased filters for
hate/harassment/doxxing/explicit content; block or route to moderation.

Defamation & proof: Fact claims (e.g., "stole equipment") must include
evidence (moderator can request); otherwise convert to opinion phrasing
or remove.

Extortion policy: Prohibit "change deliverables or I'll leave 1★";
report → fast moderation; outcomes: warning → strike → suspension.

Right of reply: Public owner reply allowed once per review; edit window
for typos 30 minutes postpublish.

Appeals: If review violates policy or is demonstrably false, removal or
redaction; SLA ≤5 business days.

Shadowweighting: Reviews from accounts with anomaly flags contribute
reduced weight without visible deletion (preserves transparency while
limiting harm).

Killswitch: If toxicity rate \> 0.8% of reviews in a 7day window,
tighten filters and increase human sampling.

H\) Buyer/Brand Reputation (visible to providers)

Buyer Rep (0--100) components:

Payments & approvals: escrow timely, acceptance within window.

Reliability: ontime arrival/start, cancellation/noshow rate.

Respect & Safety: subrating from providers; safety flags (sealed).

Dispute rate & outcomes.

Display to providers: Buyer Rep ring, recent labels ("Pays on time",
"Clear briefs"), and counts
