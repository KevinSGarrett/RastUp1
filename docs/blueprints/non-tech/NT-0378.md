al national exposure. Admin has kill‑switches
for money and safety features with two‑person approval.\
• Admin Operability: No checklist is \'done\' unless Support can resolve
the top 3 edge cases without engineering and Trust can perform required
actions with an audit trail.\
• Help‑Center Alignment: All user‑facing copy is mirrored in the help
center with last‑updated dates and visual examples. We avoid legal
jargon; we explain outcomes and next steps.\
• QA Strategy: We prefer production‑like staging with seeded data and
synthetic bookings. We test under simulated load, outage, and edge cases
(ACH returns, 3DS failures, moderation queue spikes).\
• Holdouts & Experiments: Promotions, ranking, and any economic nudges
run with control cells and pre‑registered guardrails. We pause
experiments when guardrails breach.\
• Close‑the‑Loop: Post‑launch, we hold 7/30/90‑day reviews that tie
metrics to actions and retire ineffective steps.

Implementation Notes:\
• Flags & City Gates: Every user‑visible change ships behind a flag with
a documented blast radius, an owner, and a rollback plan. City
allowlists prevent accidental national exposure. Admin has kill‑switches

Context & Alignment: Our launch approach is city‑by‑city with nationwide
signups allowed, starting in Houston. We launch subscription‑free,
monetize through take‑rate and usage‑based promotions with strict
eligibility and caps, and keep public media within an artistic‑only
boundary with Safe‑Mode defaults for guests. Deliverables are handled
via external links (Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests. Instant
Book requires ID verification; background checks are opt‑in (Trusted
Pro). Payments include card (3DS when required) and ACH (with a reduced
buyer fee). Feature flags and city gates control blast radius, and the
Admin Console enables Support, Trust, Finance, and Ops to act without
code changes.

Goals:\
• Launch paid visibility without harming search relevance or trust.\
• Prove ROAS with holdouts; keep density and frequency caps enforced.\
• Give providers clear setup, reporting, and refunds for invalid clicks.

Pre‑launch:\
□ Eligibility gates (IDV, Rep ≥ 70, no strikes) enforced; QS formula
tuned; CPC floors by role/city set.\
□ Density caps: ≤2 boosted in top‑20; ≤1 above the fold; frequency caps
per buyer/session/day.\
□ Holdout cells configured (5--10%); dashboards wired; invalid‑click
detection live with auto‑crediting.

Provider UX:\
□ Boost setup wizard; suggested bid range; estimated clicks; QS
improvement checklist.\
□ Reporting: impressions, clicks, CTR, CPC, inquiries, bookings, GMV,
ROAS; alerts for budget depletion and invalid clicks.

QA & Monitoring:\
□ End‑to‑end click tracking; fraud heuristics test; miscate
