communications that set correct expectations, drive
adoption, and reduce support burden.\
• Use lifecycle sequences for providers and buyers tied to real
behaviors.\
• Keep help‑center content synchronized with UI and policy changes.

Provider lifecycle (examples):\
□ Welcome (IDV + how to publish first package).\
□ First inquiry → \'How to convert to booking\' tips.\
□ First booking → \'Deliverables manifest & acceptance\' checklist.\
□ Trusted Pro pass → badge benefits + Boost coupon.\
□ Churn risk → nudge with availability tips and price guidance.

Buyer lifecycle (examples):\
□ Welcome → search tips + Safe‑Mode explainer.\
□ First booking → \'What to expect\' and refund windows; ACH discount
callout.\
□ Post‑booking → review request; referral invite.\
□ RFP broadcasts → \'How to write a brief\' guide.

Help‑center & status updates:\
□ Visual examples for artistic‑only boundaries; Safe‑Mode toggle guide.\
□ Tax and money articles; city perks pages; studio deposit
explanations.\
□ Status page for incidents; templates for banners and in‑app notices.

Owners & Roles:\
• Marketing --- sequences and brand voice.\
• Product --- in‑app copy and help‑center alignment.\
• Support --- macros and FAQ freshness; deflection tracking.\
• Trust --- safety copy and escalation comms.\
• Finance --- money/tax copy accuracy.

Instrumentation & Readiness Signals:\
• Open/click rates; conversions from emails; deflection %; NPS changes;
complaint rates; unsubscribes.

Top Risks & Mitigations:\
• Over‑emailing → unsubscribes; mitigate with behavior‑based triggers
and caps.\
• Policy confusion → keep examples fresh and visible; avoid legalese.

Acceptance Criteria (Go/No‑Go):\
✓ All core sequences QA'd; help‑center synchronized with UI; status page
playbooks ready.\
✓ Comms calendar coordinated with city turn‑ups and feature flags.

Scenario Playbook --- Press spike:\
Trigger: Traffic surge and PR mentions\
Response: Pin welcome and safety posts; adjust sequences to onboard
quickly; ensure support has pinned macros.\
Roll‑back/Forward: Return to normal cadence.\
Owner: Marketing/Product \| Telemetry: bounce_rate, activation_rate \|
User Copy: "New here? Start with how booking works in 3 steps."

Scenario Playbook --- Email deliverability dip:\
Trigger: Inbox placement declines\
Response: Warmup IPs; prune lists; adjust sending windows; improve
DKIM/SPF; diversify to in‑app and SMS for critical comms.\
Roll‑back/Forward: Reintroduce segments gradually.\
Owner: Marketing \| Telemetry: bounce/complaint rates \| User Copy: N/A
(backend deliverability)

Implementation Notes:\
• Flags & City Gates: Every user‑visible change ships behind a flag with
a documented blast radius, an owner, and a rollback plan. City
allowlists prevent accidental national exposure. Admin has kill‑switches
for money and safety features with two‑person approval.\
• Admin Operability: No checklist is \'done\' unless Support can resolve
the top 3 edge cases without engineering and Trust can perform required
actions with an audit trail.\
• Help‑Center Alignment: All user‑facing copy is mirrored in the help
center with last‑updated dates and visual examples. We avoid legal
jargon; we explain outcomes and next steps.\
• QA Strategy: We prefer production‑like staging with seeded data and
synthetic bookings. We test under simulated load, outage, and edge cases
(ACH returns, 3DS failures, moderation queue spikes).\
• Holdouts & Experiments: Promotions, ranking, and any economic nudges
run with control cells and pre‑registered guardrails. We pause
experiments when guardrails breach.\
• Close‑the‑Loop: Post‑launch, we hold 7/30/90‑day reviews that tie
metrics to actions and retire ineffective steps.
