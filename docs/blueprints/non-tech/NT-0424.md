 within US‑only scope with city‑gated rollouts and reversible
flags for policy shifts.\
• Handle notices (DMCA, subpoenas) and FCRA steps correctly.

Risk statements (top of mind):\
• Public content crosses into prohibited explicit territory; moderation
inconsistency.\
• FCRA missteps in background checks (missing notices/wait periods).\
• ADA/accessibility gaps lead to complaints; insufficient
accommodations.\
• Anti‑discrimination violations in listings or conduct.\
• DMCA takedown process failures; repeat infringer policy gaps;
subpoenas mishandled.

Primary causes & contributing factors:\
• Ambiguous examples; Safe‑Mode defaults unclear; edge cases (art vs
explicit).\
• Insufficient training; templates missing; vendor SLAs unclear.\
• Design system not audited; large regressions; insufficient QA.\
• Users write exclusionary criteria; support unsure how to enforce.\
• Intake missing required elements; slow response; poor documentation.

Leading indicators & early warning signals:\
• Appeal reversals trend; inconsistent outcomes between moderators.\
• Trusted Pro appeals citing notice issues; legal inquiries from users.\
• Accessibility tickets; external complaints; screen‑reader bug
reports.\
• Reports of discriminatory language; negative social mentions.\
• Increased DMCA notices; repeat infringer counts; subpoena volume.

Preventive controls & mitigations:\
• Examples gallery and Safe‑Mode; moderator calibration; appeals
workflow.\
• FCRA playbook with timers; pre‑adverse/adverse templates; vendor
integration tests.\
• WCAG 2.1 AA audit cadence; accessible components; accommodation
request flow.\
• Non‑discrimination policy; templates; education first then
enforcement.\
• DMCA agent; intake form; counter‑notice path; evidence storage; legal
review; subpoena intake process.

Incident playbooks (summary):\
• Edge content escalation to T&S + counsel; apply consistent actions;
update examples page.\
• FCRA audit of recent cases; pause badge decisions until gaps fixed;
retrospective training.\
• Accessibility triage; roadmap patch; communicate timelines without
legal admissions.\
• Discrimination report: intake, evidence, proportionate action; publish
learnings (de‑identified).\
• DMCA/subpoena queue; timely responses; transparency reporting.

RACI / Owners:\
• Legal, Trust, Design System, Support, Data (for audits).

Instrumentation & success metrics:\
• Moderation reversal rates; FCRA timing adherence; accessibility defect
backlog; discrimination reports; DMCA SLA adherence.

Thresholds & triggers (Go/No‑Go, rollback, escalation):\
• Any missed FCRA adverse action window → immediate audit; accessibility
Sev‑1 bug count \> threshold → freeze release until patched.

Dependencies & assumptions:\
• §8 policy docs; §4.14 admin tools; §10 drills; vendor contracts with
SLAs.

Acceptance checklist (risk under control when):\
□ Public policy pages live; templates/flows tested; audits scheduled;
DMCA agent designated; subpoena process documented.

Scenario Deep‑Dive --- Accessibility complaint from major creator:\
Context: High‑profile creator raises screen‑reader issues publicly.\
Trigger: Social and support spikes.\
Immediate actions: Triage bugs; publish acknowledgment; offer direct
assistance; prioritize fixes; regression tests.\
Communication: Accessible statement and timeline; private outreach.\
Rollback/Forward: None; incorporate feedback into design system.\
Owner: Design System + Product \| Telemetry: accessibility_bug_count,
time_to_fix \| Evidence: Bug tickets; repro steps; user feedback

Execution Notes:\
• Every risk has a dashboard tile with an owner, a definition of the
denominator, and a weekly narrative. • Risk reviews pair with §10
post‑launch 7/30/90‑day reviews and §8 compliance calendar. • Where a
risk spans multiple squads, the city GM or Risk DRI chairs the review;
actions have due dates. • We prefer reversible changes (flags) and
narrow blast radius (city gates). • We avoid \'security by obscurity\';
we publish
