es). Repeat
for small (≤\$150), mid (\$300--\$600), and large (\>\$1,000) bookings.\
• Promotions ROI: Using holdouts, estimate incremental GMV from paid
exposure. Attribute revenue to promotions net of invalid‑click credits.
Ensure quality score and eligibility keep paid from cannibalizing
organic relevance.\
• Sensitivity toggles: Vary ACH adoption (10--40%), chargebacks
(0.2--0.6%), cancellations (3--10%), and promotions adoption (5--25%) to
see contribution margin swings.\
• City expansion: Add a second city with a 3--6 month lag. Reuse
maturation curves and observe shared services leverage (support, SRE).

Financial Modeling Disclaimer: This section provides planning
assumptions, formulas, and structures for internal modeling. It is not a
forecast or financial advice. All sample numbers are illustrative;
replace with real inputs once telemetry in §5 is live.

Context & Alignment: We operate a US‑only creative marketplace
connecting models, photographers, videographers, and content creators
with buyers and studios. Launch strategy is subscription‑free;
monetization is via take‑rate on bookings and usage‑based promotions
(capped, labeled, eligibility‑gated). Public content is artistic‑only;
deliverables use external storage with immutable manifests. Instant Book
requires ID verification; background checks are opt‑in (Trusted Pro).
ACH reduces buyer fee to 3% where enabled. Feature flags and city gates
control rollout; admin tools and audits turn policy into software.

Goals:\
• Plan operating expense and headcount that unlock milestones without
over‑hiring.\
• Tie hiring to GA gates and city expansion; prefer contractors for
commodity tasks early.\
• Keep data/infra spend disciplined (≤15% of GMV).

Key variables & baselines:\
• People: Engineering, Product, Design, Data, SRE, Support, Trust,
Finance, City Ops, Marketing.\
• Vendors: Comms, e‑signature, background/IDV, tax, analytics,
observability, ticketing.\
• Facilities: Remote‑first; optional coworking; travel for city ops and
studio partners.\
• Tooling: Source control, CI/CD, security scans, feature flags,
experimentation, admin console.

Core formulas (structure; plug real telemetry later):\
• Payroll_t = Σ (FTE_role × fully_loaded_cost_role) + Contractors_t\
• VendorOpex_t = Σ (SaaS_subscriptions) + Minimums (tax, comms) not in
COGS\
• TotalOpex_t = Payroll_t + VendorOpex_t + Facilities_t + Misc_t

Phase‑linked hiring:\
We add squads as §6 milestones unlock: Beta adds Growth/Promotions; GA
adds Money/Tax and Studios; post‑GA adds SRE. Support and T&S ramp with
ticket volume.

Contractor vs FTE:\
Use contractors for non‑differentiated tasks (e.g., help‑center
population, manual reviews) while retaining core differentiation
(search, booking, money, admin) in‑house.

Cost discipline:\
Finance reviews TB/day (data) and compute envelopes (§5.12). Feature
owners are accountable for admin operability to prevent support burden.

Instrumentation & success metrics:\
• Opex runway in months; burn multiple; payroll % of total opex; vendor
spend vs plan\
• Ticket volume per 1,000 legs; staffing vs SLA; error budget burn vs
engineer operating time

Top risks & mitigations:\
• Hiring ahead of demand → burn increases without revenue; mitigate with
gates\
• Under‑investing in SRE → reliability risk; mitigate with phased
on‑call and drills\
• Vendor sprawl → consolidate; maintain an approved vendor list and
renewal calendar

Acceptance checklist:\
□ Headcount plan per phase approved; offer templates ready; recruiting
funnel metrics live.\
□ Vendor roster with costs and owners published; renewal dates in
calendar.\
□ Runway and burn tracked monthly; alerts when thresholds breached.

Modeling Deep‑Dive:\
• Scenario setup: Define a city cohort with starting supply and demand,
apply search→inquiry and inquiry→booking rates from §6.2/§6.3, then
layer on cancellations, lateness, and chargebacks. Compute
