ired (Phase 2).

J\) CrossSell & AttachinFlow

On studio page: "Pair with Talent" opens People search prefiltered to
the studio's city & chosen date/time.

From talent flows: Attach a Studio drawer presents top studio matches;
selected studio is added to checkout as a Linked Booking Group (separate
policies & payouts).

K\) Performance & Accessibility

Media: responsive images (WebP/AVIF), lazyload, no autoplay video on
mobile; alttext required.

Keyboardable filters & calendar; ARIA on tabs; clear focus rings; large
hit areas (44×44).

TTI target: \<2.5s (3G Fast) for detail page with skeletons.

L\) Telemetry (events)

studio.view • studio.book.start/complete • studio.request.start/complete

calendar.slot.view • calendar.slot.select • instant_book.toggle

attach_studio.from_profile.open/select

deposit.authorize/capture/void/release • adjustment.open/resolve •
claim.open/resolve

rules.view • docs.sign • checkin.start/end

promotions.boost.create • promotions.featured.purchase

analytics.view (host) • verification_lite.start/pass/fail

M\) Acceptance Criteria (mark 4.5 FINAL)

Public studio detail page includes Header (price/hr, min hours,
capacity, Verified Studio, Instant Book), Gallery, Quick Facts,
Amenities, Rules, Availability, Pricing, Host, Location (approx),
Reviews, Pair with Talent module.

Booking widget: date/time & duration, crew size, cleaning fee, deposit
info, Smart Docs preview, IB/Request logic, clear price breakdown.

Create/Edit wizard implements Basics, Media, Amenities, Rules
(surveillance/hazards), Pricing & Schedule, Deposits & Docs,
Verification Lite, Review & Publish.

Host dashboard provides Calendar, Bookings, Messages, PostBooking
Adjustments, Damage Claims, Rules editor, Verification status,
Promotions, Analytics.

Scheduling supports min hours, buffers, IB windows, blackout dates;
doublebooking protection at payment.

Pricing & fees follow §3.1; deposit holds are authorizations (not GMV);
overtime/overage adjustments implemented with evidence windows.

Policies & safety enforced: studio refund matrix, Smart Docs esign
before access, geofenced checkin/out, surveillance rules, address
privacy.

AttachinFlow works both directions (from talent checkout drawer and from
studio page to People search) creating a Linked Booking Group at
checkout.

Accessibility/Performance budgets met; Telemetry events fire.

N\) Why this works

Clear separation: Studios behave like spaces with their own rules,
deposits, and reviews---no confusion with people roles.

Frictionless planning: Buyers can attach a studio during talent checkout
or start from a studio and find matching talent.

Trust builtin: Verification Lite, Smart Docs, deposits, and checkin/out
create predictable, evidencefirst resolution paths.

Launchready: Tight scope avoids venuemarketplace bloat while delivering
the features creators actually need to shoot.

§4.6 --- Search & Results (Roleaware + Studios)

Goal: Make search fast, fair, and creatorspecific. Keep People (roles)
and Places (Studios) distinct but easy to combine. Surface the right
filters for each role, enable perplatform social targeting, and support
AttachinFlow so buyers can add a Studio to a talent checkout in one
pass.

A\) Entry Points & Routes

Global Search header button → /search?role={role}&city={city}

Category hubs (e.g., /photographers) deeplink to search prefiltered by
role & city.

Studio hub /studios?city={city} is a specialized search for Studios
(grid + optional map).

AttachinFlow (from Brief/Checkout): opens a Studio drawer preseeded with
city/date/time.

Saved Search links open the same route with filters applied.

Safe Mode is ON by default and gates People results that exceed
"Lingerie/Swim"; Studios are not gated (SFW media only).
