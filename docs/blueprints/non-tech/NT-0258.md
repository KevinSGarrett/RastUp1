ity Gates: externally visible policy toggles ship
behind flags; Admin can rollback with a two‑step confirmation; events
are audited.\
• Admin Operability: every rule has a corresponding tool in Admin
(approve/deny/redact/pause/escalate) with immutable logs.\
• Evidence Hygiene: store hashes and immutable links; redact PII in
views; never edit originals; legal holds override deletion where
applicable.\
• Copy Clarity: explain outcomes and next steps; avoid citing laws in
emails; link to help‑center with examples.\
• Training: quarterly refreshers for T&S, Support, Finance; FCRA basics;
chargeback representment; accessibility etiquette.\
• Measurement: we track leading/lagging indicators to tune thresholds
and staffing.
