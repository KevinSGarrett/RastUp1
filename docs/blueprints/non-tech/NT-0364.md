Roll‑back/Forward: Return to normal when SLA restored.\
Owner: Trust \| Telemetry: idv_latency, idv_failure_rate \| User Copy:
"Identity checks are taking longer than usual. Your verification will
complete shortly."

Scenario Playbook --- Harassment spike after PR:\
Trigger: Reports \> baseline × 3\
Response: Triage macros; temporary rate limits; visible enforcement on
egregious cases.\
Roll‑back/Forward: Lift limits after sustained normal levels.\
Owner: Trust/Support \| Telemetry: report_rate, action_SLA \| User Copy:
"We're actively addressing increased reports. Thanks for your patience."

Implementation Notes:\
• Flags & City Gates: Every user‑visible change ships behind a flag with
a documented blast radius, an owner, and a rollback plan. City
allowlists prevent accidental national exposure. Admin has kill‑switches
for money and safety features with two‑person approval.\
• Admin Operability: No checklist is \'done\' unless Support can resolve
the top 3 edge cases without engineering and Trust can perform required
actions with an audit trail.\
• Help‑Center Alignment: All user‑facing copy is mirrored in the help
center with last‑updated dates and visual examples. We avoid legal
jargon; we explain outcomes and next steps.\
• QA Strategy: We prefer production‑like staging with seeded data and
synthetic bookings. We test under simulated load, outage, and edge cases
(ACH returns, 3DS failures, moderation queue spikes).\
• Holdouts & Experiments: Promotions, ranking, and any economic nudges
run with control cells and pre‑registered guardrails. We pause
experiments when guardrails breach.\
• Close‑the‑Loop: Post‑launch, we hold 7/30/90‑day reviews that tie
metrics to actions and retire ineffective steps.
