 simulated load, outage, and edge cases
(ACH returns, 3DS failures, moderation queue spikes).\
• Holdouts & Experiments: Promotions, ranking, and any economic nudges
run with control cells and pre‑registered guardrails. We pause
experiments when guardrails breach.\
• Close‑the‑Loop: Post‑launch, we hold 7/30/90‑day reviews that tie
metrics to actions and retire ineffective steps.

Operational Disclaimer: This playbook bundle is an internal execution
guide. It is not a public policy document. Where compliance or legal
actions are required, consult Section 8 and counsel. Where money flows
change, consult Sections 3 and 4.

Context & Alignment: Our launch approach is city‑by‑city with nationwide
signups allowed, starting in Houston. We launch subscription‑free,
monetize through take‑rate and usage‑based promotions with strict
eligibility and caps, and keep public media within an artistic‑only
boundary with Safe‑Mode defaults for guests. Deliverables are handled
via external links (Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests. Instant
Book requires ID verification; background checks are opt‑in (Trusted
Pro). Payments include card (3DS when required) and ACH (with a reduced
buyer fee). Feature flags and city gates control blast radius, and the
Admin Console enables Support, Trust, Finance, and Ops to act without
code changes.

Goals:\
• Ensure safety systems are ready and staffed before public exposure.\
• Align ID verification, background checks, Safe‑Mode, and moderation to
city‑specific risk patterns.\
• Document adverse‑action and appeals so decisions are consistent and
defensible.

ID Verification (IDV):\
□ Vendor SLA tested; fallback flow documented; fraud heuristics tuned
for local IDs.\
□ Eligibility rules: Instant Book gated by IDV; Verified‑only search
filter returns correct results.\
□ Privacy: PII vault operational; admin masked views; access logs
audited.

Background Checks (Trusted Pro):\
□ Consent screens live; pre‑adverse/adverse templates localized; waiting
periods per FCRA.\
□ Badge logic integrated with search ranking tie‑break and provider fee
nudge (where applicable).\
□ Subsidy program configured for first cohort; budget caps set.

Moderation & Safe‑Mode:\
□ Classifier thresholds tuned; artistic‑only examples published; appeals
workflow tested.\
□ Queue staffing plan with on‑call escalation; SLA dashboards live;
content templates stocked.\
□ Harassment/doXXing macros; emergency law‑enforcement flow rehearsed.

Owners & Roles:\
• Trust lead --- overall safety posture; moderation and appeals.\
• Legal --- FCRA compliance; policy approval.\
• Data --- classifier thresholds; safety telemetry.\
• Support --- macro training; triage playbooks.

Instrumentation & Readiness Signals:\
• Moderation SLA (time to action), appeal reversal rate, report rate per
1,000 legs, IB suppression count.\
• IDV completion rate; Trusted Pro adoption; safety incidents trend.

Top Risks & Mitigations:\
• Over‑moderation → creator churn; mitigate with clear examples and
appeals.\
• Under‑moderation → safety risk; mitigate with queue staffing and
thresholds.

Acceptance Criteria (Go/No‑Go):\
✓ Moderation SLA met in dry runs; appeal path validated.\
✓ IDV flows stable; Trusted Pro notices correct; badge logic live.\
✓ Safe‑Mode default for guests verified; examples page published.
