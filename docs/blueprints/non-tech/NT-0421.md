RI chairs the review;
actions have due dates. • We prefer reversible changes (flags) and
narrow blast radius (city gates). • We avoid \'security by obscurity\';
we publish clear user guidance, train staff, and keep audit trails for
all sensitive actions. • The risk register itself is versioned; changes
record rationale and observed metrics.

Execution Notes:\
• Every risk has a dashboard tile with an owner, a definition of the
denominator, and a weekly narrative. • Risk reviews pair with §10
post‑launch 7/30/90‑day reviews and §8 compliance calendar. • Where a
risk spans multiple squads, the city GM or Risk DRI chairs the review;
actions have due dates. • We prefer reversible changes (flags) and
narrow blast radius (city gates). • We avoid \'security by obscurity\';
we publish clear user guidance, train staff, and keep audit trails for
