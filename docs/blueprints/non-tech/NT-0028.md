caching is allowed for preview generation only.

B\) Delivery Room Rules (updated)

Manifest is truth: Acceptance/disputes reference the pinned manifest
(counts/specs/filenames/sizes).

Spec autochecks: Count, MIME/codec, pixel dimensions, bitrate/duration,
color profile; flags must be cured before acceptance or go to dispute.

"All finals delivered" toggle: Provider asserts completeness; system
validates against manifest.

C\) Provider Responsibilities (contractual)

Keep external links accessible through the review & dispute windows.

Supply accurate manifests and, where feasible, checksums.

Ensure clientready files are present in the deliverables folder at
acceptance.

D\) Feasibility Notes (devlight)

OAuth scopes limited to readonly file metadata + download of preview
proxies; no destructive scopes.

Linkonly works dayone; OAuth can phase in.

For Drive/Dropbox API quotas, we ratelimit and cache manifests; fallback
to manual manifest upload if provider blocks API access.

E\) Acceptance Criteria

External delivery required for files \> 500 MB; platform generates and
pins manifests.

Preview generation for photos & proxies for video; watermark detection
on finals.

Retention banners & responsibilities shown; acceptance blocked if
required links are missing.

OAuth + linkonly ingestion; secure storage of tokens/passwords; no bulk
mirroring.

SubSection 1.5 --- Trust, Safety & Verification

Goal: Give every user confidence to book and meet new
collaborators---safely, transparently, and with minimal friction---while
protecting the marketplace from abuse, fraud, and policy risk. This spec
covers user verifications, badges, safety features, moderation,
enforcement, and operations.

A\) Principles

Safety first, friction last: Strong protections with the fewest possible
extra steps.

Visible trust: Clear verification badges and reputation signals where
users make decisions (search cards, profile headers, checkout).

Evidence by default: Contracts, chat logs, checkins, and delivery
artifacts form a reliable record for disputes and incident response.

Least privilege: Share the minimum personal info needed; keep private
data private.

Consistency: Predictable policies, transparent outcomes, and auditable
decisions.

B\) Policy Scope & User Eligibility

Age: Platform is 18+ only at launch (simplifies compliance and content
policies).

Geography: US launch; future locales require local backgroundcheck
availability and legal review.

Prohibited Conduct: Harassment, discrimination, hate, threats, illegal
activity, sexual services, escorting, doxxing, offplatform payment
solicitation, explicit sexual content onsite, intellectualproperty
violations.

Allowed Content (launch): SFW + artistic nudity with NSFW gating;
explicit sexual content disallowed onplatform. (Users may link to
external sites but uploaded media must comply.)

C\) The Verification Stack (levels, flows, incentives)

credits, InstantBook eligibility). Costs that require third parties are
passthrough or bundled in Pro.
