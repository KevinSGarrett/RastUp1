with Safe‑Mode
defaults for guests. Deliverables are exchanged via external links
(Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests; escrowed payments release on
acceptance. Instant Book requires ID verification; background checks are
opt‑in (Trusted Pro). Rollouts are city‑gated behind feature flags.
Admin Console enforces least‑privilege, JIT elevation, two‑person
approvals, and full audit trails.

Goals:\
• Protect user data through least‑privilege, strong auth, encryption,
and auditable admin actions.\
• Reduce vendor and supply‑chain risks with diligence and limited
scopes.\
• Prepare for incidents with clear roles, drills, and communications.

Risk statements (top of mind):\
• PII exposure (name, address, TIN) through misconfigured access or
export.\
• Admin account abuse or credentials compromise leading to unauthorized
actions.\
• Vendor breach affecting processors, tax, IDV, or e‑signature data.\
• Secrets leakage (API keys) causing system compromise.\
• Insufficient logging and monitoring hindering incident response.

Primary causes & contributing factors:\
• Missing RBAC/JIT; broad exports; unmasked PII in UI.\
• Weak 2FA; phishing; shared accounts; poor device hygiene.\
• Vendor lacks SOC/Pentest posture; over‑broad data sharing; missing
DPAs.\
• Keys in source; unmanaged vault; no rotation schedule.\
• Logs without context; missing audit trails; alert fatigue.

Leading indicators & early warning signals:\
• Spike in PII unmask events; large exports; access from new geos.\
• SSO anomalies; failed 2FA; password resets; new device alerts.\
• Vendor incident notices; latency anomalies; unusual API error
patterns.\
• Code scans finding secrets; vault access anomalies; long‑lived
credentials.\
• Missing or failing alerts; gaps in audit logging; delayed incident
detection.

Preventive controls & mitigations:\
• RBAC with PII scopes; masked by default; export reasons; PII access
ledger (§4.14.1).\
• SSO + mandatory 2FA; device trust; phishing training; no shared
accounts; JIT elevation.\
• Vendor due diligence; DPAs; least‑data sharing; breach clauses;
offboarding checklist.\
• Secrets in vault; rotation; static code analysis; CI guards;
break‑glass procedures.\
• Centralized logging; audit immutability; tuned alerts; regular drills;
incident runbooks.

Incident playbooks (summary):\
• Privacy incident: contain; assess; notify per counsel; post‑mortem;
reinforce training.\
• Admin compromise: revoke sessions; rotate secrets; review actions;
force password + 2FA resets.\
• Vendor breach: disable integrations; evaluate blast radius;
communicate if impacted.

RACI / Owners:\
• Security lead (or SRE), Data, Legal/Privacy, Product owners for admin
features.

Instrumentation & success metrics:\
• PII access ledger anomalies; secrets rotation adherence; vendor
attestations current; incident MTTA/MTTR; audit completeness.

Thresholds & triggers (Go/No‑Go, rollback, escalation):\
• Any confirmed PII exfiltration → Sev‑0; admin compromise → Sev‑1;
vendor breach → Sev‑1 with legal involvement.

Dependencies & assumptions:\
• §4.14.1 access governance; §5.12 observability; vendor SLAs; legal
counsel.

Acceptance checklist (risk under control when):\
□ RBAC live; PII masked; logs/audits immutable; drills completed; vendor
records current; secrets rotation schedule active.

Scenario Deep‑Dive --- Suspicious PII export:\
Context: Large CSV export by a new admin at odd hours.\
Trigger: Anomaly alert on export size/time.\
Immediate actions: Suspend token; interview admin; check purpose; delete
copies; rotate access; document.\
Communication: Internal only unless exposure confirmed; consult
counsel.\
Rollback/Forward: Restore access with tighter scopes; training
follow‑up.\
Owner: Security lead \| Telemetry: audit_export_events,
pii_unmask_events \| Evidence: Audit log, export file hash, device/IP

Execution Notes:\
• Every risk has a dashboard tile with an owner, a definition of the
denominator, and a weekly narrative. • Risk reviews pair with §10
