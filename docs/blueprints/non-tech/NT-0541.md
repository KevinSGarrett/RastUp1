tegrations ship behind flags, follow privacy
policies, and require vendor due diligence, DPAs, SLAs, and legal
review. Commercial terms are illustrative until negotiated.

Context & Alignment: US‑only marketplace at launch; subscription‑free;
monetization via take‑rate and capped, eligibility‑gated usage‑based
promotions. Public content is artistic‑only with Safe‑Mode on for
guests. Deliverables flow via external links (Drive/Dropbox) with
immutable manifests; escrow releases on acceptance. Instant Book is
gated by ID verification; background checks are opt‑in (Trusted Pro).
Rollouts are city‑gated behind feature flags; Admin Console enforces
least‑privilege, JIT elevation, two‑person approvals, immutable audits,
and kill‑switches.

Goals:\
• Let power users connect our marketplace to their workflows without
compromising safety or fairness.\
• Start with read‑oriented, narrow scopes; expand only after abuse and
privacy reviews.

Target partner segments:\
• Zapier/IFTTT; Slack/MS Teams; Google Drive/Dropbox;
Google/Apple/Outlook Calendar; Notion/Airtable; Mailchimp/HubSpot for
brands.

Mutual value proposition:\
• Automations reduce admin toil (e.g., copy bookings to calendar, notify
teams, archive deliverables manifests).\
• Brands integrate with their CRMs; providers streamline follow‑ups and
reviews.

Selection criteria & due diligence:\
• OAuth scopes; per‑event webhooks; rate limits; strong ecosystem docs;
permissioning and audit logs.

Integration scopes & surfaces (what we build):\
• Outbound webhooks for booking events; calendar sync; file manifest
export; Slack notifications; RFP broadcast hooks.\
• Inbound limited (e.g., RFP create from a brand system) with strict
validation and rate limits.

Commercial & legal patterns (illustrative):\
• Most APIs free to integrate; paid plans for high call volumes; partner
directories for co‑listing.

Enablement & co‑marketing (how we launch together):\
• Developer portal (later); sample zaps; Slack app with scoped
permissions; step‑by‑step guides; support forum.

Top risks & mitigations:\
• Abuse via automations (spam); privacy leaks via over‑broad scopes;
rate‑limit exhaustion; shadow workflows creating support burden.

Operational playbooks (summary):\
• Throttle; per‑user caps; approval for certain zaps; audit logs;
automated abuse detection; revoke tokens on violations.

Owners & RACI:\
• Platform PM/Eng, Security, Data, Support.

KPIs & leading indicators:\
• Integration adoption; errors; rate‑limit hits; support tickets;
bookings attributed to integrations.

Acceptance criteria (ready / successful when):\
✓ Zaps and Slack app pass security review; scopes minimal; abuse anomaly
rates low; docs published.

Timeline & checkpoints:\
• Post multi‑city GA; staged allowlists; developer portal beta later.

Scenario Playbook --- Slack app spam:\
Trigger: Automated DMs create spam complaints\
Response: Disable outbound DM event; require manual approval; limit to
channels; add rate caps.\
Legal/Comms: Changelog and help‑center updates; outreach to affected
users.\
Roll‑back/Forward: Re‑enable with stricter scopes after mitigation.\
Owner: Platform PM/Security \| Telemetry: spam_reports, rate_limit_hits
\| Evidence: Webhook logs; Slack audit logs

Implementation Notes:\
• Partner Governance: Maintain a single source of truth for partner
status (prospect, NDA, pilot, GA), contacts, contracts, scopes, and
SLAs. Tag all features behind partner flags and city gates to avoid
blast‑radius mistakes. • Privacy & Data: Apply least‑data
principles---only request scopes needed for the user value; rotate
tokens; revoke access on inactivity. • Security & Audits: Vendor
SOC/pentest reports stored with expiry reminders; incident bridges
pre‑arranged for Sev‑1/Sev‑0. • Co‑Marketing Discipline: Announce after
pilots prove value; enforce clear success metrics; align PR/brand tone
with our artistic‑only policy. • Support & Playbooks: Create
partner‑specific macros; train Support/Trust on integration quirks
