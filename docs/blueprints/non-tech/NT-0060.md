U\) Why this works

Clear scope → fewer disputes: Smart Docs + normalized quotes + manifests
make expectations explicit.

Storage costs contained: We host previews & paperwork; originals stay in
Drive/Dropbox/etc. with verifiable manifests.

Faster to "yes": Smart Invite + Quick Quotes + Fit Score reduce time to
award.

Verifiable outcomes: Autochecks, posting verification, and autoaccept
keep projects moving and payouts timely.

Fair & safe: Relevancefirst ranking, verified cohorts, esign gating, and
escrow create trust without adding paywalls.

SubSection 3.6 --- Seller Tools & Workflows (Models • Photographers •
Videographers • Creators)

Goal: Give sellers a fast, repeatable workflow that turns profile views
into booked, wellscoped jobs---and makes delivery, disputes, and payouts
painless. Tools are roleaware, storagesane, and trustfirst. Monetization
remains usagebased (no subscriptions at launch).

A\) Principles

Publish in minutes, improve forever: ship an MVP service profile
quickly; refine with datadriven suggestions.

Roleaware, single account: one login, multiple service profiles (Model /
Photographer / Videographer / Creator) with clean separation in search
and reviews.

Clarity prevents disputes: packages, Smart Docs, Delivery Room
manifests, and timeboxed review windows make outcomes objective.

Storagesane by default: previews on platform; originals remain in
seller's cloud (Drive/Dropbox/OneDrive/Box/S3 links).

Trust earns advantages: verification & reputation unlock Instant Book,
tiebreaks, Early Payout, RFP priority---never paytowin.

B\) Seller Onboarding Wizard (10--12 minutes, roleaware)

Step 1 --- Choose roles: Model / Photographer / Videographer / Creator
(can add more later).\
Step 2 --- Portfolio basics: upload perrole cover image(s), 12--24
highlights; set Nudity Tier & Comfort (Models/Creators).\
Step 3 --- Packages (per role): pick package templates (below), add
price/duration/what's included, turnaround time, revision policy,
overtime & change rates.\
Step 4 --- Addons: travel (matrix), extra looks/edits, rush delivery,
social posts, studio rental addon, hair/makeup partner, etc.\
Step 5 --- Availability: weekly schedule blocks, Instant Book windows,
buffers, travel time logic; connect calendar (ICS).\
Step 6 --- Location: base city, service radius, touring dates (for
traveling models/creators).\
Step 7 --- Safety & preferences: chaperone welcomed/required, genderpref
team (optional), boundaries.\
Step 8 --- Pricing strategy: enable intro discount (first 3 bookings),
lastminute fill (autodiscount empty slots), minimum price guardrail.\
Step 9 --- Connect social: IG/YT/TT/X for verified chips & search
filters (per §1.2 addendum).\
Step 10 --- Verification prompts: ID (to unlock Instant Book),
optionally Background (Trusted Pro), Studio Lite (if applicable).\
Publish → profile QA checklist + "What improves ranking" tips (response
time, verified docs, price fit).

C\) Package Templates & AddOns (per role)

Templates are opinionated defaults sellers can edit---keeps quotes
comparable & reduces scope creep.
