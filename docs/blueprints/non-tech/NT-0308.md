gibility‑gated). Public content is artistic‑only;
deliverables use external storage with immutable manifests. Instant Book
requires ID verification; background checks are opt‑in (Trusted Pro).
ACH reduces buyer fee to 3% where enabled. Feature flags and city gates
control rollout; admin tools and audits turn policy into software.

Goals:\
• Establish realistic, testable assumptions for traffic, conversion, and
growth that tie to product flags and city gates.\
• Align finance with measurement: every assumption maps to an event or
metric in §5.\
• Create a baseline and two alt scenarios (conservative/aggressive)
without overfitting early noise.

Key variables & baselines:\
• Cities & cohorts: Houston (Cohort‑1) GA at T+90; City‑2 pilot at
T+180; City‑3 at T+240 under §6.4 readiness.\
• Supply (providers): Active providers = listed + ID‑verified with ≥1
package; Trusted Pro as a subset.\
• Demand (buyers): Active buyers = ≥1 inquiry or booking in trailing 28
days.\
• Conversion: Search→Inquiry (S→I) and Inquiry→Booking (I→B) defined in
§6; rep score & Instant Book shift these.\
• GMV: Gross value of bookings excluding buyer fee and tax; sum of
subtotals per leg.\
• AOV: Average order value per leg; varies by role and city tier.\
• Cancellations: Time‑banded rates; late cancels affect reputation and
rebooking behavior.\
• Chargebacks: Rate on card transactions; ACH has different failure
profile (returns).\
• Payment mix: Card vs ACH share; ACH reduces buyer fee but lowers
processing cost.\
• Promotions adoption: Share of eligible providers purchasing
CPC/Featured; ROAS targets from §3.3.\
• Tax coverage: Allowlist states per §4.12/§6.3; banner when off.\
• Seasonality: Minor seasonality; spikes near holidays and local event
seasons.

Core formulas (structure; plug real telemetry later):\
• ActiveProviders_t = NewProviders_t + Reactivated_t − Churn_t\
• ActiveBuyers_t = NewBuyers_t + Reactivated_t − Churn_t\
• Inquiries_t = Searches_t × (S→I) × EligibilityRate_t\
• Bookings_t = Inquiries_t × (I→B) × (1 − CancelRate_t)\
• GMV_t = Σ (BookingSubtotal_i) for all completed legs in period t\
• AOV_role,city = GMV_role,city / Bookings_role,city\
• TakeRate_net ≈ (ProviderFee% × GMV) + BuyerFee% × GMV_equiv +
PromotionsRevenue − ProcessorCOGS − VariableOpsCOGS

Cohort maturation curves:\
Supply tends to mature faster than demand in creator marketplaces. We
model a s‑curve for provider activation (profile→IDV→first package→first
booking) and a slightly slower curve for buyer repeat rate. These curves
are parameterized so we can fit them once we have 8--12 weeks of
telemetry.

Eligibility & gating:\
Availability, distance, price fit, and NSFW toggle are filters that
reduce the eligible supply set a buyer sees. Promotions never expand
eligibility; they only surface within matching results.

Data discipline:\
Every assumption above maps to a field or table in the §5 warehouse
(fact_search, fact_inquiry, fact_booking_leg, fact_payment, fact_promo).
Finance does not hard‑code rates; we consume aggregates from Gold tables
with freshness SLOs.

Instrumentation & success metrics:\
• Search→Inquiry and Inquiry→Booking (city×role) with 7/14/28d trends\
• Active providers and buyers (28d) with growth and churn by cohort\
• GMV, AOV, and leg count by city×role\
• Cancellation and chargeback rates by payment type\
• ACH share of checkouts; promotions adoption and ROAS by role×city

Top risks & mitigations:\
• Early noise overfitting → use ranges and guardrails; wait for stable
cohorts before revising baselines.\
• Mis‑measured eligibility → implement precise denominator definitions
and audits in §5.8.\
• Seasonality misreads → annotate events (festivals, holidays) in a
calendar dimension.

Acceptance checklist:\
□ Assumptions document reviewed monthly; deltas tied to observed
telemetry.\
□ Cohort curves parameterized and ready to fit after 8--12 weeks of
data.\
□ Gold tables for search, inquiry, booking, and payment pass DQ gates.
