tes; perks for under‑represented
niches; flexible radius defaults.\
• PR blowback on nudity policy → artistic‑only examples page; Safe‑Mode
defaults; trained press responses.

Acceptance Criteria (Go/No‑Go):\
✓ Sufficient supply (≥300 ID‑verified) and demand (≥1,000 waitlist) in
place.\
✓ Support and Trust staffing schedules confirmed for local hours.\
✓ Perks, floors, and featured modules toggled and measured with caps.

Scenario Playbook --- Uneven neighborhood coverage:\
Trigger: Searches returning \<10 results in key districts\
Response: Targeted outreach and incentives; Featured rotation weight to
uncovered areas.\
Roll‑back/Forward: Normalize rotation once coverage improves.\
Owner: City GM \| Telemetry: no_results_rate, results_count_by_zip \|
User Copy: "We're expanding coverage in your area---new creators
arriving daily."

Scenario Playbook --- Featured slots underperform:\
Trigger: CTR \< target for 3 days\
Response: Swap creatives (portfolio picks), adjust slot order, test copy
on ribbons.\
Roll‑back/Forward: Restore prior set if CTR worsens.\
Owner: Growth \| Telemetry: featured_impr, featured_ctr,
inquiries_from_featured \| User Copy: N/A (UI visual only)

Implementation Notes:\
• Flags & City Gates: Every user‑visible change ships behind a flag with
a documented blast radius, an owner, and a rollback plan. City
allowlists prevent accidental national exposure. Admin has kill‑switches
for money and safety features with two‑person approval.\
• Admin Operability: No checklist is \'done\' unless Support can resolve
the top 3 edge cases without engineering and Trust can perform required
actions with an audit trail.\
• Help‑Center Alignment: All user‑facing copy is mirrored in the help
center with last‑updated dates and visual examples. We avoid legal
jargon; we explain outcomes and next steps.\
• QA Strategy: We prefer production‑like staging with seeded data and
synthetic bookings. We test under simulated load, outage, and edge cases
(ACH returns, 3DS failures, moderation queue spikes).\
• Holdouts & Experiments: Promotions, ranking, and any economic nudges
run with control cells and pre‑registered guardrails. We pause
experiments when guardrails breach.\
• Close‑the‑Loop: Post‑launch, we hold 7/30/90‑day reviews that tie
metrics to actions and retire ineffective steps.
