Instant Book enabled

Price fit to query median

Historical CTR (timedecayed)

Paid Order Score: score = log(bid) \* α + QS \* (1−α) (default α=0.5;
guardrails 0.3--0.7).

Tiebreak: lower effective CPC (bid ÷ QS) wins to reward relevance.

Keys: promos.boosts.qs_weight_bid, promos.boosts.qs_weight_quality.

F\) Fraud, Quality & Budget Protection

Invalid click detection: rapid repeats, zerodwell bounces, selfclick
signatures, coordinated patterns; invalidated charges autocredit within
24h to wallet.

Frequency caps (buyerside): 2 impressions/session, 5/day/provider, 4h
cooldown.

Budget safety: daily overspend guard (≤5%); autopause if anomaly; alert
Ops.

Abuse flags: misleading pricing or availability → autopause all promos;
route to T&S.

G\) Admin UI --- Controls & Flows

1\) Floors & Pricing Editor

Table per city×role: CPC floor \$, avg QS, fill %, median CPC, CPB,
ROAS; edit floors inline; schedule changes; staged rollout slider.

Featured grid: weekly price ladder; slots booked vs inventory;
impression guarantees; set makegood rules (auto credit or extension).

2\) Eligibility & Caps

Toggle eligibility DSL (with validator), set density/frequency caps; set
ribbon allowlist.

3\) QS Weights & Preview

Adjust α and QS subweights (guardrails); simulate ordering on last N
queries; diff view vs current.

4\) Experiments

Create A/B cells: density caps A(2/20) vs B(1/20); QS α 0.5 vs 0.3;
ribbon text variants.

Set success metrics (ROAS lift, CPB↓, buyer CTR↑); autostop on trust KPI
breach (e.g., "Hide promoted" \> 3%).

5\) Credits & MakeGoods

Issue wallet credits (invalid clicks, makegood for underdelivered
Featured); caps and reasons required; ledger posted to Finance.

6\) Reporting

Dashboards: adoption %, spend, CPC distribution, CPB, bookings
attributed, incremental GMV (holdout), ROAS percentiles, invalid click
rate, buyer "Hide" rate, revenue contribution.

H\) Measurement & Incrementality

Attribution: click → inquiry → booking → GMV; 7day postclick window;
firsttouch within paid.

Holdout design: rolling 10% eligible supply suppressed from paid to
estimate incremental bookings/GMV; configurable (5--10%).

Core KPIs: median ROAS ≥ 2.5×, CPB targets by role, invalid click rate
\< 7%, buyer "Hide promoted" ≤ 3%, paid revenue mix 10--15% by month 6.

Cohort views: new vs returning providers; city cohorts; role cohorts.

I\) Finance & Billing Integration

Wallet ledger: CPC charges (valid clicks), Featured weekly charges,
invalid click credits, makegoods.

Prepaid vs payasyougo: support both; card on file; lowbalance alerts.

Refund policy: only invalid clicks autocredit; Featured makegoods issued
on short delivery (impressions) or outages.

J\) Alerts & Safeguards

Spend spike \> X% houroverhour in a city/role.

Invalid clicks \> 10% for any provider in 24h.

Buyer "Hide promoted" rate \> 3% dayoverday.

ROAS median \< 2.0× for 7 days in a city → suggest floor drop or QS
tuning.

Inventory saturation: density cap hits 90% for 3 days → consider raising
floor or adding slots cautiously (with A/B).
