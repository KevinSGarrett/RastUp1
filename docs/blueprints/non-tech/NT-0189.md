B\) Deliverables & Acceptance Tests (DoD)

Service Profiles & Portfolio

Can create up to 3 profiles (e.g., Model + Photographer).

Upload images (max 50), short video thumbnails; tag collaborators for
approval.

DoD: profile page loads \<2.0s; SafeMode thumbnails on by default;
collaborator tag → approval flow works.

Search v1

Filters: role, city + radius, availability window, price min/max, model
attributes (height, hair, categories), Instant Book toggle.

Cards show: name/role, price range, availability badge, distance, ID
Verified chip.

DoD: search → profile click p95 \< 600ms (cached), zeroresult handling
has suggestions; Instant Book filter hides ineligible.

Packages, Addons, Licensing, Travel

Provider configures packages; addon menu (e.g., extra edits); license
tiers (web/social/commercial); travel rules: base radius free, permile
beyond or fixed zones (City/Metro/National).

DoD: price box computes travel correctly from buyer address; license &
addons itemized in checkout & receipt.

Booking & Escrow

Request flow with provider accept/decline; Instant Book for IDverified
providers.

Escrow charge on accept/IB; autocancel if not accepted within policy
window.

DoD: escrow transaction succeeds, state machine:
requested→accepted→inprogress→delivered→completed; timeouts & cancels
reflect in UI.

Messaging & Change Orders

Threaded chat; attach sample moodboard; quote message into Change Order
(time or price); buyer approves to apply.

DoD: change order reissues updated receipt; both parties see a version
timeline.

Deliverables & Acceptance

Provider posts manifest (Drive/Dropbox links + checksums); buyer marks
Needs changes or Accept.

DoD: Accept triggers completion → payout queue; manifest audit is
visible in case of dispute.

Cancellation/Refund Policy v1

Timebanded rules (e.g., buyer 24--72hout: 50% refund; \<24h: 0%;
providerfault: 100%).

DoD: refunds post automatically with correct math & receipts;
providerfault returns buyer service fee.

ID Verification v1

Hosted KYC; success flips ID Verified; failure paths handled (retry).

DoD: Instant Book locked behind IDV; search nudges verified cards; Admin
can view/override with reason.

Payments & Payouts v0

Card + 3DS; payout 48h after completion; rolling reserve on first three
payouts (configurable).

DoD: payout ledger shows net math; reserve status visible; finance close
exports match settlements (variance ≤ 0.5%).

Admin v1 & Support

Support: reschedule, policy refunds, price adjustment within caps;
message redaction; case notes.

Trust: IDV queue; safemedia overrides with reason.

Finance: reissue receipts; download daily close CSV.

DoD: all actions are audited (who/what/why), require reasons, and show
diffs.
