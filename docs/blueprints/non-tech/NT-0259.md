 We are launching a US‑only creative marketplace
focused on models, photographers, videographers, and content creators.\
We have chosen a subscription‑free go‑to‑market with monetization via
take‑rate and optional, usage‑based promotions that are
eligibility‑gated and capped.\
Public content is artistic‑nudity‑only; Safe‑Mode defaults for guests
apply. Deliverables are transferred via external storage (Drive/Dropbox)
with immutable manifests.\
Payments flow through card (3DS where required) and ACH (with a
buyer‑fee discount); funds are escrowed and released on acceptance.\
Instant Book is gated by ID verification; background checks are opt‑in
(Trusted Pro). Feature flags and city gates are used for reversible,
auditable launches.\
Admin consoles enable Support, Trust & Safety, Finance, and Ops to
perform routine tasks without code changes.

Goals:\
• Define what is allowed on public surfaces and how Safe‑Mode works.\
• Provide clear reporting, review, and appeal paths that respect
creators and protect viewers.\
• Prevent harassment, hate, doxxing, and risky off‑platform
arrangements.

Scope & Applicability:\
Applies to profiles, search cards, feeds, messaging previews, and any
public‑facing media. Private deliverables may include mature content if
lawful and consented, but they are delivered via external links and not
hosted by us.

Definitions (plain language):\
• Artistic nudity: non‑sexualized displays of the human body used in
creative expression or documentary work.\
• Explicit sexual content: acts, genitals in sexual context, or fetish
material; not permitted on public surfaces.\
• Safe‑Mode: default setting that blurs or hides sensitive thumbnails
for guests and first‑time viewers; toggle for signed‑in adults.\
• Harassment: unwanted conduct that targets a person; includes threats,
sexual harassment, doxxing.\
• Doxxing: publishing private identifying information without consent.

Policy Statements:\
• Public media criteria: allow artistic nudity; disallow explicit sex
acts and fetish content on public pages.\
• Consent requirements: all persons depicted must be 18+; no minors even
in background; creators affirm consent and ownership.\
• No harassment or hate: zero tolerance for threats, slurs, or
dehumanization; removal and sanctions escalate.\
• No illegal content: weapons solicitation, trafficking, drugs, and
fraud are prohibited.\
• Safe‑Mode defaults: guests and first‑time viewers see blurred
sensitive thumbnails; adults can opt in after acknowledgment.\
• NSFW label: creators must self‑label sensitive sets; classifiers add
secondary checks; moderators resolve disputes.\
• Appeals: structured path with second‑level review; examples published
to reduce ambiguity.\
• Location safety: discourage posting precise home addresses; studio
addresses handled via verified studio listings.\
• Messaging protections: rate limits, spam detection, PII redaction
options (support), and report/ block.

Procedures & Operational Playbooks:\
• Intake → triage → action flow: content reported triggers a queue;
moderators evaluate policy fit; actions applied with templates.\
• Escalation: high‑risk items (potential exploitation, credible threats)
escalate to T&S lead and legal; involve law enforcement where
appropriate.\
• Education loop: add clarifying examples to help center when ambiguity
recurs; tune classifiers to reduce false positives.

Enforcement & Remedies:\
• Tiered responses: label, blur, age‑gate, remove; repeat violations
escalate to strikes and disable; IB suppression during investigations.\
• Harassment outcomes: blocks, message restrictions, and account holds;
doxxing treated as severe violation.\
• False‑positive safety net: quick appeal channel; restore with apology
copy when moderation erred.

Data, Privacy & Retention:\
• PII minimization in reports and queues; moderator access restricted
and audited; redaction tools for public pages.\
• Media retention: we store only thumbnails and metadata for moderation;
