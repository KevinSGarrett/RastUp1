o exposed genitals; female nipples not visible in previews; implied
nudity ok with strategic coverage.

Feed posts

Same preview constraints as portfolio; no explicit calltooffplatform
payments; collaboration tags require consent (accept/deny).

Reviews

Disallow slurs, harassment, doxxing, explicit language; allow
experiencebased criticism.

Only verified booking participants can post (per §1.4).

Studios

Images show space/amenities only; no explicit sets; safety disclosures
required for hazardous features.

RFP briefs

Disallow sexualized gig requests; disallow offplatform payment
instructions; require budget ranges.

E\) Automated Signals & Thresholds (configurable via §4.14.2)

NSFW classifier with three bands: allow, sensitiveallow (blur), block.

OCR PII detection: email/phone/payment handles → autoredact in public
captions; warn uploader.

Keyword denylist (nsfw.keyword_denylist): sexual solicitation, hate
slurs, offplatform payment verbs/handles.

Hash banlist: known abusive images (internal + partner lists).

Spam heuristics: rapid identical posts, URL stuffing, engagement bait →
throttle.

F\) UserFacing UX

During upload: live preview shows autocrop/blur; user can adjust crop
within SFW bounds (hard stops).

After decision:

Approved: normal publish.

Sensitiveallow: blur overlay with "Tap to view" + policy tooltip.

Removed: user receives reason code, policy excerpt, and appeal link.

Tagging: tagged collaborators must accept before content shows on their
profile/feed.

Education nudges: "Previews must be SFW---here's how to crop/cover."

G\) Enforcement & Escalation

Autoactions on violation counts (rolling 30 days):

2 content removals → Content warning + education card.

3 removals → DM throttle + search demotion.

4 removals → IB off and Boost suppression; queue to T&S.

Hard violations (explicit sexual content, child/younglooking sexualized,
hate symbols) → immediate takedown + Strike2/3 (T&S ladder) and
potential suspension.

Appeals: within 14 days; reviewed by a separate moderator or Neutral
Review if highimpact.

H\) Tools for Moderators

Sidebyside original vs preview thumbnail; crop grid overlay; sensitive
area heatmap.

Redact inline (captions/hashtags); system stores hash of original.

Batch actions for spam waves; bulk restore/remove with single reason.

Simulateas card: preview how a search card will render postdecision.

Policy helper: quick links to current §1.5 rules and cityspecific
appendums.

I\) Integrations & Handoffs

Trust & Safety (§4.14.3): escalations (P0/P1), sanctions ladder updates,
strike sync.

Search (§4.14.2): demotion flags, sensitiveallow affects ranking weights
(minor).

Support (§4.14.5): user communications, appeal tickets, macros.

Promotions (§3.3): promoted inventory excludes "sensitiveallow" unless
explicitly allowed by config.

Verification (§4.13): repeated misrepresentation → require reverify.

J\) Metrics & Quality

Operational KPIs

Autoapprove ratio (target ≥ 85% after first10 gating phase)

Timetodecision median (Priority B ≤ 8h)

Appeal rate & overturn rate (goal \< 10% overturn)

Repeat violation rate (per 30/90 days)

Sensitiveallow share and CTR impact (ensure buyer trust)

Offplatform payment phrase incidence (monthovermonth ↓)

Quality

Weekly calibration sessions; golden set refresh; reviewer agreement
rate.

Classifier drift monitor (precision/recall on labeled sample).

K\) Telemetry (Moderation)

L\) Acceptance Criteria (mark 4.14.4 FINAL)

Endtoend upload→screen→publish pipeline with placeholders and subsecond
automated screening.
