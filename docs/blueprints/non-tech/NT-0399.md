• Holdouts & Experiments: Promotions, ranking, and any economic nudges
run with control cells and pre‑registered guardrails. We pause
experiments when guardrails breach.\
• Close‑the‑Loop: Post‑launch, we hold 7/30/90‑day reviews that tie
metrics to actions and retire ineffective steps.

Ownership)

Risk & Process Disclaimer: This section is an internal risk‑management
blueprint. It does not constitute legal, tax, or security advice.
Coordinate with counsel and security leaders before externalizing any
policy or committing to obligations. All examples are illustrative and
must be adapted to the realities measured in Section 5 dashboards.

Context & Alignment: US‑only marketplace launch; subscription‑free
start; monetization via take‑rate and usage‑based promotions with strict
eligibility and caps. Public content is artistic‑only with Safe‑Mode
defaults for guests. Deliverables are exchanged via external links
(Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests; escrowed payments release on
acceptance. Instant Book requires ID verification; background checks are
opt‑in (Trusted Pro). Rollouts are city‑gated behind feature flags.
Admin Console enforces least‑privilege, JIT elevation, two‑person
approvals, and full audit trails.

Goals:\
• Create a shared language for risk across product, trust, finance,
legal, and ops.\
• Standardize scoring (likelihood × impact) and prioritization (RPN) to
focus on material risks.\
• Define ownership, cadence, and escalation paths; integrate with flags
and city gates.

Risk statements (top of mind):\
• Mis‑moderation or unclear public‑content boundaries leading to
press/regulatory risk.\
• Payments outage or mis‑settlement leading to user harm and trust
loss.\
• Chargeback/fraud ring increasing losses and throttling growth.\
• PII exposure or vendor breach causing legal and reputational damage.\
• Tax miscollection due to misclassification or engine errors causing
financial exposure.\
• Operational overload (support/trust) at launch reducing quality and
SLAs.

Primary causes & contributing factors:\
• Ambiguous policy or incomplete training; lack of examples in §8.2.\
• Insufficient end‑to‑end money testing; single processor dependency.\
• Weak off‑platform leakage controls; lack of buyer education at
checkout.\
• Over‑privileged admin roles; missing JIT elevation; vendor
misconfigurations.\
• Incorrect item mappings in tax engine; gaps in allowlist rollout.\
• Underestimated volume; insufficient macros; incomplete admin tools.

Leading indicators & early warning signals:\
• Spike in appeals overturning moderation decisions; media mentions with
negative framing.\
• Checkout p95 latency and error spikes; rise in payout \'failed\'
states.\
• Chargeback rate \> baseline; clustering by BIN/issuer or geography.\
• Admin PII unmask spikes; vendor SOC/pentest exceptions; unusual export
volumes.\
• Reconciliation variances by state; tax quote error rates; support
tickets citing tax confusion.\
• SLA breaches in Support/Trust; increased reopen rates; macro usage
slump.

Preventive controls & mitigations:\
• Publish examples and Safe‑Mode defaults; require two‑person review for
edge policies.\
• Multi‑processor readiness; drills; ACH fallback and banners.\
• In‑chat off‑platform warnings; escrow value copy; IB incentives for
verified users.\
• RBAC, JIT elevation, two‑person approvals; vendor due diligence; PII
vault.\
• Tax engine allowlists; nightly reconciliations; receipt itemization
tests.\
• Staffing buffers; calculators/macros; deflection via help‑center;
admin operability gates.
