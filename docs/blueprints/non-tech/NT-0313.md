studios. Launch strategy is subscription‑free;
monetization is via take‑rate on bookings and usage‑based promotions
(capped, labeled, eligibility‑gated). Public content is artistic‑only;
deliverables use external storage with immutable manifests. Instant Book
requires ID verification; background checks are opt‑in (Trusted Pro).
ACH reduces buyer fee to 3% where enabled. Feature flags and city gates
control rollout; admin tools and audits turn policy into software.

Goals:\
• Define all revenue streams with formulas that tie to product behavior
and receipts.\
• Make revenue recognition auditable via booking legs, receipts, and
promotions wallet.\
• Avoid vanity revenue---focus on durable drivers aligned with user
value.

Key variables & baselines:\
• Provider fee: 12% of booking subtotal; drops to 10% on portion \>
\$1,000; −1% Instant Book; −0.5% Trusted Pro (floor 9%).\
• Buyer fee: 5% (min \$3); 3% with ACH where enabled; refunded on
provider‑fault cancels.\
• Promotions: Search Boost (CPC) and Featured (weekly flat) usage‑based
with eligibility; clear caps and labels.\
• Tips: 0% platform fee; processed post‑completion (not revenue).\
• Other: None at launch (no subscriptions); potential future add‑ons
deferred to §13.

Core formulas (structure; plug real telemetry later):\
• Revenue_provider_fees_t = Σ (ProviderFeeRate_i × Subtotal_i) over
completed legs i\
• Revenue_buyer_fees_t = Σ (BuyerFeeRate_i × Subtotal_i) adjusted for
refunds and ACH discount\
• Revenue_promotions_t = CPC_clicks_t × CPC_price_t + Featured_slots_t ×
Weekly_price_t\
• NetRevenue_t = Revenue_provider_fees_t + Revenue_buyer_fees_t +
Revenue_promotions_t − ProcessorCOGS_t − Credits_invalid_clicks_t

Why buyer fee exists:\
Buyer fee offsets processor costs and support while keeping provider
take‑home attractive. The ACH discount aligns incentives by reducing
both processor cost and buyer fee, encouraging low‑cost rails.

Promotions alignment:\
Promotions generate revenue only when providers opt in, and only within
relevance caps. Holdouts quantify incremental GMV so providers spend
when it pays, not because ranking is rigged.

Recognition timing:\
Provider and buyer fees are recognized when the leg completes or is
accepted; promotions revenue is recognized as clicks/impressions
deliver; credits for invalid clicks reduce promotions revenue as
contra‑revenue.

Instrumentation & success metrics:\
• Take‑rate components: provider vs buyer vs promotions (stacked) by
city×role\
• Promotions adoption, CPC, CTR, ROAS distribution; invalid‑click credit
rate\
• ACH share and its effect on buyer fee and processor COGS\
• Refunded buyer fees due to provider‑fault cancels

Top risks & mitigations:\
• Perception of pay‑to‑win → capped slots, labels, eligibility gates;
transparency in \'Why am I seeing this?\'\
• Buyer fee backlash → clear value copy (escrow, contracts, support) and
ACH discount messaging\
• Revenue leakage via off‑platform payments → in‑chat warnings,
throttles, Trusted Pro incentives

Acceptance checklist:\
□ Revenue lines reconcile to receipts (per leg) and promotions wallet
events.\
□ Invalid‑click credits pipeline operational; audits sampled weekly.\
□ ACH effect on buyer fee and processing cost visible in dashboards.

Modeling Deep‑Dive:\
• Scenario setup: Define a city cohort with starting supply and demand,
apply search→inquiry and inquiry→booking rates from §6.2/§6.3, then
layer on cancellations, lateness, and chargebacks. Compute GMV per
cohort and pass it through fee structure, taxes, and processor costs.\
• Unit economics: For a representative \$X booking, compute provider fee
(12%), buyer fee (5% or 3% with ACH), and processing cost. Show platform
net before variable ops (content safety scans, IDV/BG subsidies). Repeat
for small (≤\$150), mid (\$300--\$600), and large (\>\$1,000) bookings.\
• Promotions ROI: Using holdouts, estimate incremental GMV from paid
exposure. Attribute revenue to promotions net of invalid‑click credits.
