L\) Lineage: "Follow the money/decision" maps

Example 1 --- A payout on a modeling leg

External: charge.succeeded → fin.checkout_pay_success (Bronze) →
Silver/Gold fact_payment.

Booking completes → fin.payout_queue/sent webhooks → fact_payout +
fact_payout_leg.

Dashboard tile "Provider earnings" references Gold facts; lineage panel
lists processor charge id, payout id, adapter_version.

Example 2 --- ID Verified badge

idv.verification.completed webhook → ts.idv_decision (Silver) →
dim_user.id_verified=true (Gold SCD2).

Search ranking uses Rep & verified flags; lineage shows vendor
decision + time.

Example 3 --- Social ER filter
