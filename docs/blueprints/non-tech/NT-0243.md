used on
models, photographers, videographers, and content creators, with buyers
and studios as complementary roles. The business choices already
ratified are: subscription‑free launch; take‑rate monetization with
usage‑based promotions that are eligibility‑gated and capped;
city‑by‑city go‑to‑market beginning in Houston with nationwide signups
allowed; artistic‑nudity‑only policy for public surfaces; external
deliverables via Drive/Dropbox manifests; daily finance close; ACH with
buyer‑fee discount; Instant Book gated by ID verification; optional
background checks; and feature‑flagged rollouts with strong admin
tooling and audit trails.

Goals:\
• Pay fairly, simply, and predictably; compete for senior builders
without distorting the org.\
• Use national‑US bands; equity refreshes tied to impact; bonus for
on‑call rotations.\
• Document the offer process and negotiation principles to avoid hidden
bias.

Why this matters:\
This sub‑section operationalizes choices we made across Sections 1--6.
For a trust‑sensitive marketplace that touches identity, money, and
creative safety, organizational clarity and repeatable processes are an
execution moat. Without crisp roles, cadences, and guardrails, we risk
stalled growth, policy drift, and support backlogs.

Operating principles:\
• Split teams by value stream (discovery/booking, money/tax,
trust/safety, promotions/growth, studios) rather than by technical
layer.\
• Treat admin and analytics surfaces as first‑class product; if support
cannot resolve an edge case without code, the feature is not done.\
• Ship behind flags; prefer reversible decisions; use city gates for
higher‑risk launches.\
• Everything that touches safety or money produces an audit trail and
measurable outcomes.

Operational themes & responsibilities:\
• Ranges per level/role; equity mix ranges; founder grants policy;
referral bonuses; market review cadence.

Processes & cadences:\
• Weekly business review: KPIs, incidents, error budgets, experiments,
city gating decisions.\
• Squad rituals: daily standups, mid‑week demos behind flags, Friday
retros; shared ship log.\
• Risk review: T&S, Finance, and Legal sign‑off for changes that alter
policy, money movement, or public content rules.\
• Post‑incident reviews: timelines, user impact, root causes,
code/config changes, owner, and follow‑ups.

Success metrics:\
• Offer acceptance rate; regretted attrition; comp‑to‑band variance;
diversity goals met at hiring bands.

Top risks & mitigations:\
• Ad‑hoc exceptions; over‑index on cash; under‑leveled hires; retention
shocks; secrecy around compensation.

Deep dive: Case study --- Houston Alpha: How the team used feature flags
and admin tools to run a safe Instant Book pilot without code changes
mid‑flight.\
We document the detection signals, the decision tree, the admin actions
available, and the roll‑forward/roll‑back conditions. Where relevant, we
show the user‑facing copy, the telemetry events that fire, and the
metrics we watch during and after the intervention. Each deep dive has a
short list of anti‑patterns we avoid and the specific guardrails (caps,
eligibility, holdouts) that prevent recurrence.

Deep dive: Scenario --- ACH returns spike: How Finance and Support
coordinate, which macros they use, and how the buyer‑fee discount copy
changes temporarily.\
