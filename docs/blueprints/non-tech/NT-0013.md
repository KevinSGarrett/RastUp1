these results.

Subscriber count is labeled Unverified by default; manual verification
adds a Verified by Platform chip.

Addendum --- §1.2 Search & Discovery (Studios) --- FINAL

Goal: Add Studios as a searchable space listing type with
creativespecific filters, clear result cards, savedsearch support, and
ranking rules that keep talentfirst flows intact. This does not elevate
Studios to a coequal pillar---just a complementary search mode and
attach step.

A\) Role Selector & Entry Points

Role selector (top of Search) adds Studio alongside Model / Photographer
/ Videographer / Creator / FanSubscription Creator.

Safe Mode: does not hide Studios (no 18+ gating for spaces).

Attach in flow: When a buyer searches talent with a date/time, a
"Suggest Studios nearby" pill appears; clicking opens the Studio search
prefiltered by city/date/time.

D\) Saved Searches & Alerts

Users can Save Search in Studio mode (all filters preserved).

Daily batched alerts for new/updated studios matching the saved query.

Combo templates: "Talent + Studio in \[City\] this weekend" creates two
saved searches (talent & studio) tied to the same date window.

E\) Ranking Logic (Studio role)

Order = Relevance to filters → Availability match (slot fit, min hours)
→ Distance → Price fit (to buyer's range) → Reputation (space reviews) →
Verified Studio tiebreak → Instant Book tiebreak.

No paytowin: Paid promotions (if enabled later per §3.3) sit in clearly
labeled, densitycapped positions and never bypass filter matching.

Freshness: recent calendar updates get a small boost (avoids stale
listings).
