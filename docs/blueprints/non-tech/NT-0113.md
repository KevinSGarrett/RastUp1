l Verification (metrics & badges)

Route: /verify/social

Connect Instagram/YouTube/TikTok/X via OAuth; request readonly insights
scopes; display exactly what we fetch.

Verified chips appear on profile/search cards (e.g., IG 182k • 2.8% ER,
"Verified via API").

Sync: nightly + manual refresh up to 3×/day (ratelimited); handles token
expiry gracefully.

Unlink: allowed; metrics fall back to selfreported (hidden by default
unless buyer toggles "include selfreported").

Manual verify path for large accounts if API unavailable (proof post,
domain verification, lightweight review).

FanSubscription Creators: supported as Creators; no explicit content
ingested; we verify the business account identity/metrics only (Safe
Mode).

G\) Studio Verification (space owners/hosts)

Route: /verify/studio/{studioId}

Ownership/control proof --- upload lease/utility/biz registration, names
must reasonably match host profile or company.

Address validation --- geocode + mail code optional; exact address stays
private until booking confirmation.

Space evidence --- frontage photo + interior set (SFW) + entrance
signage; EXIF timestamp hints accepted.

Rules & safety --- hazards toggles, House Rules review, emergency
contact.

Review & badge --- "Studio Verified" with verification date; reverify
every 12 months or on change.

What buyers see: Studio Verified badge, neighborhood (not exact
address), rules summary.

H\) Security & Safety Addons

Phone/email verified (required); 2FA optional (strongly recommended for
payout changes).

Trusted Contact (optional): can receive checkin/out timestamps and
generalarea location on active bookings.

Emergency PIN (Phase 2): inapp PIN sends silent alert to Safety with
live thread + booking IDs.

Device trust (Phase 2): flag new devices; email confirmation for
highrisk actions.

I\) Privacy, Data Minimization & User Controls

Data we keep (minimum): doc type, issuing country, last 4 of ID,
pass/fail tokens, facematch score bucket, verification timestamps.

What we don't keep: full ID number image beyond retention window; live
selfie video frames; background raw data beyond provider access window.

Retention: ID/Studio artifacts ≤ 30--90 days postdecision
(configurable); outcome + reference kept longer for audit.

Download my data: provide verification outcomes and submitted documents
(where lawful) upon request.

Alias vs legal: users may display an alias; legal name stays private
except on tax/legal docs.

J\) Admin Console (Trust) & Risk Engine

Queue: ID/Studio/Background/Social with SLA badges; prioritize "needs
review," highvalue sellers, foundingcity cohorts.

Detail view: sidebyside evidence, vendor decisions, facematch score, doc
OCR fields, address geocode, rule acceptance logs.

Actions: approve/deny/require resubmission; redact PII; add internal
notes; trigger recheck; apply sanctions (IB off, Boost suppression).

Audit: immutable logs (who/when/what changed), reason codes, document
hashes.

Risk signals: velocity of failed attempts, device mismatch, suspicious
patterns → safety investigation flag.

K\) Notifications & Status

ID: Submitted → Passed / Needs review / Action required.

Background: In progress → Clear / Review / Consider; Preadverse +
Adverse notices with next steps.

Social: Connected → Verified metrics available; token expired →
Reconnect.

Studio: Under review → Verified / Action required; reverify reminders at
11 months.

System nudges: "Unlock Instant Book with ID," "Get Trusted Pro for fee
nudge and Boosts," "Verify studio to appear in Verified selector."

L\) Accessibility & Performance

All flows keyboardable; large tap targets on mobile capture; clear alt
text for instructions.

Use progress steppers, skeleton loaders; show typical decision times
(e.g., "Most ID checks \< 2 min") as informative copy.

Support lowbandwidth: allow photo upload from gallery if live capture
fails.
