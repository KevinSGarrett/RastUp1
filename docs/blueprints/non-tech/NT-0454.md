 --- Phase 1 (Alpha): Role Profiles, Search Basics, Booking &
Escrow, Messaging

Roadmap Disclaimer: This is an internal planning document. Dates are
placeholders and will firm up as Section 5 telemetry validates
conversion and quality gates. All items ship behind flags and city
allowlists. Nothing herein creates external commitments.

Context & Alignment: US‑only creative marketplace; subscription‑free at
launch; monetization via take‑rate and usage‑based promotions with
eligibility gates and strict caps; public content limited to
artistic‑only (guest Safe‑Mode on by default); deliverables handled via
external links (Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests; escrowed
payments released on acceptance; Instant Book gated by ID verification;
optional background checks confer Trusted Pro; city‑gated rollout with
feature flags; strong Admin Console with least‑privilege, JIT elevation,
two‑person approvals, and immutable audits.

Timeframe & Scope:\
• T‑45 to T‑0; internal + small cohort (≤150 creators/buyers).

Goals:\
• Validate the core loop with real users in a controlled cohort; collect
usability feedback.\
• Enable role‑specific profiles and search presets; keep filter UI
simple with an advanced drawer.\
• Operationalize escrow, deliverables manifests, and acceptance flows;
enforce Safe‑Mode on public surfaces.

Product Themes:\
• Minimum lovable product for discovery and booking; admin operability
before scale.

Workstreams & Deliverables:\
• Role tabs; separate reviews per role; portfolio uploads with
tagging/approvals; social metrics chips (verified if connected).\
• Search presets (e.g., \'Fashion model in Houston this week\');
advanced filter drawer; verified‑only toggle.\
• Booking requests, acceptance, change orders; deliverables manifest
(lightweight) with external link manifest capture.\
• Messaging threads with file gating; reschedule within rules;
notifications; read receipts (optional).

Feature Flags & City Gates:\
• feature.search.presets, feature.reviews.by_role,
feature.manifest.external_only, feature.messaging.read_receipts.

Dependencies & Inputs:\
• IDV vendor in sandbox; escrow on processor; ACH sandbox; help‑center;
admin refund calculator.

Top Risks & Mitigations:\
• Overly complex filters; manifest intimidation; messaging misuse;
off‑platform leakage.

Instrumentation & KPIs:\
• S→I and I→B in cohort; manifest completion rate; off‑platform warning
triggers; response time; support tickets by category.

Acceptance Criteria (Go/No‑Go):\
✓ S→I ≥ 15%; I→B ≥ 25% within cohort; admin resolves top 10 issues
without engineering; Safe‑Mode effective; no Sev‑1s.

Staffing & Ownership:\
• Profiles/Search squad; Booking/Money squad; Support; Trust; Design
Research.

Milestones & Checkpoints:\
• Alpha retrospective; copy tweaks; filter tuning; manifest
improvements; help updates.

Implementation Notes:\
• Flag Discipline: Each capability ships behind a named flag with a
runbook, owner, rollback, and blast‑radius notes. Flags default to
\'off\' in new cities.\
• Admin Operability: No workstream is \'done\' until admin tools enable
Support/Trust/Finance to handle the top 3 edge cases without
engineering.\
• Copy & Policy: All flows have help‑center articles and email/SMS
templates; copy avoids legalese and links to policy examples.\
• QA & Drills: Staging mimics production data shapes; drills include
processor/tax outages, moderation surges, and incident command
handoffs.\
• Experimentation: Features that affect marketplace economics (ranking,
boosts, fees) include holdouts and guardrails; we measure incremental
impact.\
• Data Wiring: Events land in Bronze/Silver/Gold (§5); KPIs pull only
from Gold with freshness SLOs. Definitions live in a metrics catalog.\
• Accessibility: New UI complies with WCAG 2.1 AA; screen‑reader and
keyboard paths verified; contrast ratios checked; defects triaged.\
• Security & Privacy: PII masked by default; JIT elevation for sensitive
admin actions; vendor scopes minimal; audits immutable.
