M\) Acceptance Criteria (mark 4.14.16 FINAL)

Hardisolated Sandbox with environment banners, email/SMS sink, separate
RBAC/SSO.

Seeders & scenario packs covering Support, T&S, Finance/Tax, Moderation,
Studios, Promotions, City Ops, Legal.

Simulators for payments, tax, ID/background, content scan,
notifications, maps, social; webhook replay & forcestate.

Role curricula with guided checklists, autograding, and certifications.

Incident drills & chaos kit with scoring and afteraction reports.

QA/UAT flows for feature flags, docs CMS, promotions, bulk tools, tax,
and search---all without code.

Snapshots/resets; oneclick clean room; timeboxed training access.

Guardrails (no PII, no exports, no real money movement); watermarking
everywhere.

Reporting & telemetry for training, drills, simulators, and UAT.

N\) Why this works

Teams learn fast and safely on lifelike data.

Integrations behave realistically via simulators and webhooks---no
flakiness, no vendor risk.

Quality rises---UAT & drills catch misconfigs and process gaps before
they hit production.

Culture of readiness---regular drills, certifications, and audits keep
everyone sharp.

§5.0 --- Program Overview & Principles

Goal: Establish a clear, privacysafe, auditable data foundation that
powers ops dashboards, finance/tax accuracy, trust & safety, growth
analytics, and ML---while making schema evolution lowrisk and
predictable.

A\) Scope & Owners

Inscope: Event contracts, IDs & entity graph, ingestion pipelines,
warehouse layers (Bronze/Silver/Gold), metrics catalog & semantic layer,
privacy/PII/retention, dataquality, replays/backfills, lineage, ML
feature store, and cost/perf governance.

Primary owners:

Data Eng (pipelines, storage, contracts),

Analytics (metrics catalog, BI/semantic layer),

Privacy/Compliance (PII/retention/access),

Finance Ops (recon & monthend accuracy),

Product/Obs (event coverage, telemetry).

B\) Design Tenets

Contracts first: Every feature emits versioned events; changes are
additive; breaking changes require new names.

LBGaware by design: The Linked Booking Group is a firstclass key; legs
(Talent, Studio) roll up cleanly.

Bronze → Silver → Gold: Raw immutable logs → clean typed models →
businessready facts/dims.

Privacy by default: PII masked at rest; sensitive tables in restricted
schemas with RBAC scopes (per §4.14.1/§4.14.15).

Dual freshness: Sub15minute ops freshness; dayaccurate finance close
each morning.

Single source of truth: All dashboards pull from a Metrics Catalog with
versioned definitions.

Replays are normal: Idempotent loads and event replays make
audits/backfills safe.

Costaware: Partition by date/city/role, columnar storage, lifecycle
policies, and materialized views for heavy tiles.

C\) What Section 5 Will Deliver (roadmap)

§5.1 Event contract & naming (envelope, namespaces, required fields,
versions).

§5.2 Canonical IDs & entity graph (LBG/leg joins, referential rules).

§5.3 Ingest & pipelines (stream for ops, batch for finance).

§5.4 Warehouse layers & privacy zones.

§5.5 Gold schemas (facts & dims for search, bookings, finance, promos,
tax, T&S, studios).

§5.6 Metrics catalog & semantic layer (ties to §4.14.12).

§5.7 Privacy, PII & retention policies (USfirst).

§5.8 Data quality & testing (schema, invariants, reconciliation).

§5.9 Backfills & replays (tooling + runbooks).

§5.10 External systems & lineage (origin → transforms → dashboards).

§5.11 ML feature store & modeling hooks (ranking, risk, Smart Invites).

§5.12 Cost, performance & governance (SLAs, quotas, deprecation).
