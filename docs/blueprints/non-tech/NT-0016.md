tras after checkout: Provider can offer postcheckout extras (e.g.,
"+10 edits") as onetap upsells; buyer approves & pays.

Travel/expenses: Preapproved extras (travel miles, parking, studio
rental). For adhoc expenses: upload receipt → buyer approves (or
dispute) → charge processed.

G\) Rescheduling & Cancellations (Policies)

Providers choose one of three policy templates per SP (or per package).
Buyers see the policy before paying.

Noshows & late arrivals (defaults):

Noshow (buyer): 0% refund; provider may still be reviewed.

Noshow (provider): 100% refund + strike; buyer may review; provider
flagged for support review.

Grace: 15minute grace window; beyond that, time may be deducted or
counted as noshow per policy.

Safety & force majeure exceptions:

Harassment, unsafe location, severe illness, natural events → Support
can override to full/partial refund; strikes applied accordingly. A
"safety cancel" reason shields public review text (but logs internally).

Reschedule flow:

Either party proposes a new time; if accepted, booking updates.

If not accepted within policy windows, original cancellation terms
apply.

H\) Disputes (Fair, timeboxed, evidencedriven)

When: Buyer or provider can open a dispute before payout (or within X
hours after if autoreleased; we'll keep this window short).

What we collect (inthread):

Timeline: checkin/out times, chat logs, shared files, signed contracts,
location pin (if enabled).

Evidence uploads: screenshots, deliverables, RAW proof (when relevant).

Resolution paths:

Noshow / not as described / deliverables missing:

Timebased jobs: prorated or full refund depending on attendance.

Deliverablebased: partial refund based on % of agreed deliverables; or
full refund if nothing delivered.

Partial performance: Mediation suggests partial settlement (we generate
a proposed split both can accept).

Bad faith / repeated issues: Strikes, suspension, or removal (internal
policy).

Outcome handling:

If settlement agreed → escrow splits accordingly.

If not → platform decides per policy & evidence; decision is final (per
ToS).

Chargebacks: We retain evidence packets to contest with processor;
repeat chargebackers flagged.

I\) Contracts & Releases (Builtin)

Autoattach the right forms based on roles & selected license:

Booking Agreement (scope, payment, cancellation, IP).

Model Release (for shoots with a model).

Usage License (creator → buyer; tiered).

Promotion Terms (for creators: posting dates, tags).

Esign at checkout (both parties).

Perbooking vault: Timestamped PDFs accessible to both; immutable log.

Templates: We provide clear, plainlanguage templates; providers can
upload a Custom Addendum (subject to platform review).

J\) AntiCircumvention & Safety

Onplatform payments are required. Messaging attempts to share external
payment details trigger gentle warnings and, if repeated, temporary
messaging limits.

Why it's better here: payment protection (escrow), cancellation
coverage, dispute support, verified reviews, DM credit incentives.

Emergency tools: Inthread "Safety flag" → prioritizes to Support;
optional checkin toggle that marks arrival/departure time & general area
(not visible publicly).

K\) Taxes & Compliance (US launch)

We facilitate payments between buyer and provider and will follow
applicable tax reporting obligations as a marketplace facilitator (exact
thresholds can change; we'll align with the processor's reporting
workflow).

Sales tax: Most creative services are servicebased; taxability varies by
jurisdiction. The platform will support tax toggles per state/city and
adjust at checkout when applicable.

Yearend docs: Providers get a yeartodate earnings report and any
required tax forms via the payout provider dashboard.

We avoid giving tax advice; we provide the records and surface
processorlevel reporting where applicable.

L\) Notifications & Calendar

Email/push for: requests, invites, accept/decline, payment received,
reminder (24h/2h before), reschedul
