• Accessibility: all templates should be usable with keyboard‑only
navigation and screen readers.\
• Privacy: avoid embedding real PII in examples; use placeholders
consistently.\
• City‑gates: where content varies by city, call out the delta
explicitly and tie to the corresponding feature flag.\
• Training: every appendix should have a 1‑page executive summary and a
\'how to use this\' section for Support/Trust.\
• Change control: every material change requires an entry in the
changelog, owner sign‑off, and a Slack announcement to the relevant
channel.

Implementation Notes:\
• Keep this appendix version‑controlled; link to the controlling owner
and next review date.\
• Align terminology with Section 1 UI labels and Section 5 metrics
catalog; avoid synonyms that confuse staff.\
• When examples include numbers, ensure they reconcile to Section 3.1
fee math and Section 4.12 receipts.\

Appendix F --- Tax Nexus Matrix Snapshot (ties to §4.12/§5.10)

Generated on 2025-11-04 23:53:44 UTC

Purpose\
Provide the structure of our tax nexus and taxability matrix without
hard‑coding rates or legal conclusions. This appendix explains how the
matrix is maintained, how the tax engine allowlist works, and how
Support communicates tax outcomes. It is a guide, not legal advice.

F1. Matrix Structure (Template)

Columns: State; City/County; Taxability of services (talent, studio,
digital deliverables); Marketplace facilitator obligations; Sourcing
rule (origin/destination); Registration status; Effective date;
Notes/links. Values are maintained in Admin by Tax role and published to
the tax engine allowlist.

F2. Change Control & Reviews

Quarterly review with counsel; engine sync logs; reconciliation
variances trigger investigation; audit trail stored in Admin (§4.14.7).

F3. Support Macros & Receipts Language

Plain‑English explainer for buyers: when and why taxes appear; ACH
discount messaging; amended receipt process for state‑level changes.

F4. Acceptance & Ownership

Owner: Tax & Compliance. Acceptance: zero reconciliation variances
beyond tolerance; clear help‑center entries; training complete.
