lity, holdouts) that prevent recurrence.

Deep dive: Scenario --- City‑2 gating: What evidence we require to open
promotions and tax in the next city, and how we staff support hours in
local time.\
We document the detection signals, the decision tree, the admin actions
available, and the roll‑forward/roll‑back conditions. Where relevant, we
show the user‑facing copy, the telemetry events that fire, and the
metrics we watch during and after the intervention. Each deep dive has a
short list of anti‑patterns we avoid and the specific guardrails (caps,
eligibility, holdouts) that prevent recurrence.

Implementation notes:\
• Data contracts: every event used here is defined in §5.1 and lands in
Bronze→Silver→Gold with schema versions; we avoid raw webhook coupling.\
• Feature flags: we version flags, document blast radius, and wire
kill‑switches (Admin → Config) with two‑person approval for money
moves.\
• Admin operability: before general release of any surface, Support must
demonstrate resolution of the top three expected edge cases without
engineering.\
• Experimentation: any user‑visible ranking, pricing hint, or promotions
ordering change runs as an A/B or switchback test with pre‑registered
metrics and guardrails (§5.13).\
• Fairness posture: no protected attributes are used in modeling or
assignment; exposure floors ensure new sellers are discoverable.\
• Security: least‑privilege RBAC for admin roles (§4.14.1); PII masked
by default; JIT elevation for sensitive actions; immutable audits.\
• City gating: risky changes (promotions inventory, tax expansion,
studios deposits) are rolled out city‑by‑city with measurable acceptance
gates.\
• Close‑the‑loop: every process has an owner, a dashboard, and a
mechanism to retire or revise it when it no longer serves the intended
outcome.
