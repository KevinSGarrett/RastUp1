 follow the studio matrix (e.g., \>7 days = 100%, 7--48h =
50%, \<48h = 0%); buyer fee nonrefundable.

Noshow (buyer at studio): host paid per matrix; buyer fee nonrefundable.

Force majeure/safety: platform may waive fees and refund appropriately
(studio and/or talent) per §3.9.

G\) Worked examples (clear math)

Processor assumption: \~2.9% + \$0.30 per charge (illustrative). We show
platform preprocessing revenue and an approx net after processing for
transparency.

Example 1 --- Studioonly booking

Rate: \$100/hr × 4h = \$400

Cleaning fee: \$40 → Studio subtotal = \$440

Buyer fee (5%): 0.05 × 440 = \$22.00 → Buyer pays = \$462.00

Provider fee (12%): 0.12 × 440 = \$52.80 → Host takehome (preprocessing)
= 440 − 52.80 = \$387.20

Platform revenue (preprocessing) = provider fee \$52.80 + buyer fee
\$22.00 = \$74.80

Processing (est.) on \$462: 2.9% × 462 = \$13.398 ≈ \$13.40; + \$0.30 =
\$13.70

Approx net to platform = 74.80 − 13.70 = \$61.10

Deposit hold: \$300 authorization (not charged, not GMV)

Example 2 --- Linked Group: Talent \$600 + Studio from Ex.1 (no
discounts)

Talent booking

Subtotal \$600 → Buyer fee (5%) \$30.00; Provider fee (12%) \$72.00

Platform preproc rev \$102.00; processing (est. on \$630) \$18.57 → net
≈ \$83.43

Studio booking (from Ex.1)

Platform net ≈ \$61.10

Combined (informational)

Platform preproc = \$102.00 + \$74.80 = \$176.80

Approx processing total ≈ \$18.57 + \$13.70 = \$32.27

Approx net ≈ \$144.53

Buyer sees two buyerfee lines (talent \$30, studio \$22) and a single
receipt with two sections.

If Instant Book applies to talent and/or studio, reduce the respective
provider fee(s) by 1%; math updates accordingly. ACH payment would
reduce the buyer fee(s) to 3% where used.

H\) Chargebacks & deposit captures (studio specifics)

Representment for studio chargebacks includes: checkin/out logs, rules
acceptance, houserules esign, before/after photos, and adjustment
evidence.

Deposit capture (after approved damage claim) is a separate charge; no
platform fee applied; we still prepare evidence and may incur processor
dispute fees.

Repeated abusive claims by hosts or buyers trigger Rep penalties and
eligibility throttles (IB off, boost suppress).

I\) Citybycity knobs (monetization safety)

Configure studioonly promos (e.g., 0% buyer fee on first studio booking
in founding city).

Optionally waive Studio Lite verification fee for first 25--50
hosts/city (CAC budget), not a permanent policy.

Keep provider fee floor = 9% after all discounts (applies independently
to talent and studio).

J\) Acceptance Criteria (mark §3.1 addendum FINAL)

Provider 12% / Buyer 5% applied to Studio subtotal (cleaning/addons
included; taxes/deposits excluded).

IB --1% discount applies to Studio; Trusted Pro does not (peopleonly);
\>\$1k tier reduces Studio fee portion to 10%.

Buyer fee refunds on hostfault cancels; nonrefundable on buyerfault per
studio matrix.

Deposit holds: not GMV; no platform fee on captures; lifecycle events
logged.

Overtime/overages/change orders feeable at standard rates when upheld.

Linked Group receipts show two sections and two buyerfee lines; ledgers
remain separated; partial refunds handled per booking.

Analytics: revenue by type (talent vs studio), fee mix, ACH penetration,
discount impact, deposit claim rates, chargeback ratios by type.

K\) Why this works

Simple, predictable economics extend cleanly to studios; buyers see
clear line items, hosts see reliable takehome.

Margins protected: buyer fee offsets processing; deposits don't inflate
GMV or distort fee math.

Scalable ops: perbooking ledgers + group receipts make refunds,
disputes, and reporting straightforward.

Aligned incentives: IB discount encourages fast conversion; fee tiers
keep highvalue bookings onplatform.

Monetize in Layers)

Goal: Maximize early adoption and bookings by removing monthly paywalls
and monetizing via takerate (see §3.1)
