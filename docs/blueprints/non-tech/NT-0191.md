es Houston Photographers, radius 15mi, Instant Book on →
selects a card.

Views package, adds addon + license; enters address outside free radius
→ travel autoadds.

Instant Books → card 3DS challenge → escrow authorized; thread opens
with autosummary.

Provider proposes reschedule + small price adjustment via change order →
buyer approves; receipt amends.

Shoot completes; provider posts Drive manifest; buyer requests changes
(1 round) → accepts; payout queued.

Payout lands (sandbox), statements show math; daily close report
reconciles.

Admin: support simulates refund per band; trust approves an IDV; finance
reissues a receipt.

Pass if: no manual DB edits, all receipts correct, payout ledger
reconciles, audit trail complete.

I\) Risks & Mitigations (Phase0 specific)

Escrow edge cases (card fail, 3DS friction) → clear recovery UI, retry
flow, and support macro.

Travel fee confusion → price box preview + tooltip; map radius
visualization.

Deliverables offplatform → manifest enforce + checksum capture; clear
"deliver here" guidance.

Low supply → concierge onboarding + verification subsidy coupons for
first cohort.

Support load → macros & calculators; case templates for
refunds/reschedules.

J\) OutofScope (explicit)

Promotions, Studios, ACH, Early Payout, Social API filters, Background
checks, ML ranker, LBG. These are flagged off and not required to pass
Phase0.

K\) Acceptance Criteria (mark §6.1 FINAL)

Endtoend singleleg booking with escrow and payout works in sandbox &
prod with feature flags.

ID Verified gate enforced for Instant Book; nonverified can still accept
requests.

Change Orders & Reschedule update escrow and generate amended receipts;
version timeline visible.

Cancellation/Refund engine applies policy bands with correct fee math;
providerfault refunds buyer fee.

Deliverables manifest captured; Accept/Needschanges/Accept flow drives
completion & payout.

Admin v1 supports reschedule, refund within bands, price adjust, message
redaction, and IDV approval---all audited.

Daily finance close runs; reconciliation variance ≤ 0.5%; payout
statements downloadable.

Ops tiles live (search→request, etc.); freshness \<15 min; DQ tests
(money sums, orphan checks) green 5 days.

Houston seed cohort onboarded; ≥30 active providers and ≥20 buyers
complete at least one test booking.

Alpha demo script passes endtoend without engineering intervention.

L\) Why this works

It delivers a credible, safe loop for real bookings with minimal surface
area.

Flags & cutlines keep scope tight; Admin v1 ensures we don't need code
for routine ops.

Sets the foundation for Phase1 additions (promotions, ACH, social
filters) without rework.

§6.2 --- Phase1 Public Beta (T+30 → T+90)

Goal: Open Houston to public beta (signups nationwide), prove repeatable
bookings, and validate two monetization levers---takerate and usagebased
promotions (pilot)---while adding verified social metrics search, ACH
with buyerfee discount, Trusted Pro (background checks, optin), and
reputation scoring v1. Everything remains flaggated, measured, and
reversible.

A\) Scope (what we add vs keep off)

In (Beta adds)

Perplatform social search (verified): IG/YT/TT/X followers, ER, avg
views, growth; Verifiedonly toggle, ANY/ALL match; chips on cards.

ACH checkout with buyerfee discount (5% → 3%) and fallback to card; 3DS
on card where required.

Promotions pilot (usagebased only): Search Boost (CPC) + Featured
(weekly) with strict density/frequency caps, eligibility gates (IDV +
Rep ≥70), holdout measurement, invalidclick crediting.

Reputation Score v1 (0--100): visible on profile; breakdown ("Why this
score?"); used as tiebreak (never overrides relevance).

Trusted Pro (background check, optin): FCRAcompliant flow, badge, search
filter; --0.5% providerfee nudge (stacked floors honored).

Boards & Favorites v1: foldered shortlists; shareable links (private by
default).

Profile posts (lite): text + 1--4 images (no video hosting yet);
followers feed; NSF
