(city/role), unit of assignment, holdout size.

• \*\*Sample Size & Power\*\* --- Pre‑computed; expected duration with
traffic estimates.

• \*\*Treatments\*\* --- What changes and what remains constant;
screenshots/copy.

• \*\*Instrumentation\*\* --- Events, experiment bucketing, attribution
windows.

• \*\*Analysis Plan\*\* --- Statistical tests, treatment of outliers,
sequential monitoring rules.

• \*\*Stop/Extend/End Criteria\*\* --- Numerical thresholds; min
runtime; quality checks.

• \*\*Rollout Plan\*\* --- Flags, cities, staged ramp, rollback recipe.

• \*\*Comms Plan\*\* --- Internal release notes; help‑center changes;
external messaging if any.

• \*\*Risks & Ethics\*\* --- Identify bias risks, fairness, and user
harm; mitigation.

• \*\*Post‑Mortem Checklist\*\* --- What worked, what didn't, what to
productize.

G2. Example (Promotions Density Cap A/B)

Outline a worked example with metrics (ROAS ≥ 2.5×) and guardrails
(organic S→I no worse than −3%). Include holdout cell and city gating.

G3. Storage & Discoverability

All pre‑regs stored in the warehouse (Gold) and mirrored in the Admin
experiments registry; searchable by owner, city, and metric.

G4. Acceptance & Ownership

Owner: Data Science. Acceptance: no experiment ships without a pre‑reg;
post‑mortems added within 7 days of completion.

Implementation Notes:\
• Keep this appendix version‑controlled; link to the controlling owner
and next review date.\
• Align terminology with Section 1 UI labels and Section 5 metrics
catalog; avoid synonyms that confuse staff.\
• When examples include numbers, ensure they reconcile to Section 3.1
fee math and Section 4.12 receipts.\
• Accessibility: all templates should be usable with keyboard‑only
navigation and screen readers.\
• Privacy: avoid embedding real PII in examples; use placeholders
consistently.\
• City‑gates: where content varies by city, call out the delta
explicitly and tie to the corresponding feature flag.\
• Training: every appendix should have a 1‑page executive summary and a
\'how to use this\' section for Support/Trust.\
• Change control: every material change requires an entry in the
changelog, owner sign‑off, and a Slack announcement to the relevant
channel.
