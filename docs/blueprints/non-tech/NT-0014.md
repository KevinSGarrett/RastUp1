erified Studio tiebreak → Instant Book tiebreak.

No paytowin: Paid promotions (if enabled later per §3.3) sit in clearly
labeled, densitycapped positions and never bypass filter matching.

Freshness: recent calendar updates get a small boost (avoids stale
listings).

F\) AttachinFlow (from Talent Search)

When a buyer has a talent query with a date/time:

A "Attach a Studio" pill appears above results.

Clicking opens the Studio search preseeded with city/date/time/duration;
top three results appear in an inline drawer with amenity chips.

Selecting a studio adds it to the checkout summary as a Linked Booking
Group (see §1.3 addendum).

H\) Acceptance Criteria (mark §1.2 addendum FINAL)

Studio appears in role selector; Safe Mode does not gate Studio
visibility.

Studiospecific filters implemented (core, creative amenities, rules).

Result cards show Verified badge, Instant Book chip, amenity chips,
capacity, rating.

Saved search & daily alerts work in Studio mode; combo template creates
paired searches.

Attach a Studio pill appears in talent searches with date/time; opens
prefiltered Studio drawer; selection persists to checkout.

Ranking follows relevance → availability → distance → price fit → rep →
verified → IB; no paytowin.

I\) Why this works

Creators' needs first: Filters reflect real shoot needs (light, cyc,
blackout, loadin).

Low friction attach: Suggesting studios in context boosts award rates
without bloating nav.

Clean ranking: Availability & fit come before badges, keeping search
results trustworthy.

SubSection 1.3 --- Booking, Payments & Disputes

Purpose: Make booking as fast and trustable as Airbnb/Fiverr: clear
options, instant or nearinstant confirmation, escrowed payment,
transparent cancellation rules, and a fair dispute process --- all
optimized for repeatable revenue and low support overhead.

A\) Key Concepts & Objects

Service Profile (SP): The bookable unit for a role (Model / Photographer
/ Videographer / Creator). All bookings are tied to a specific SP.

Package: A preconfigured offer (deliverables, duration, turnaround,
revisions, price). Each SP must have ≥1 package or a base hourly/day
rate.

Extras (optional): Addons the buyer can select at checkout (rush, extra
edits, travel miles, etc.). Not required to publish.

Usage License: A selectable tier (Commercial / Ads / Exclusive / Buyout)
with clear terms & price adders.

Instant Book: Book without messaging if the request matches the SP's
autorules.

Smart Invite: Private multirecipient invite (no public job board) that
lets the buyer send one request to N profiles and award 1 or more slots.

Autoaccept Rules (optin): Talent-defined conditions that autoaccept
requests (e.g., package ≥ \$X, weekday window, \<=10 miles).

B\) Booking Modes (How a booking starts)

Instant Book (optin by talent)

Visible "Instant Book" badge in search.

Buyer selects date/time, package, extras, license, location, pays →
booking confirmed immediately if within rules.

Calendar blocked; chat thread opens automatically.

RequesttoBook

Buyer configures the same elements; sends a request.

Talent can Accept / Decline / Counter (send Custom Offer with different
package/price/time).

On Accept, payment is captured and booking confirmed.

SLA nudges: autoexpire unanswered requests (e.g., 48h) to keep the
funnel clean.

Smart Invite (private)

Buyer selects up to N profiles → writes one brief (date/time,
package/budget).

Each recipient receives a private invite; buyer can award one or
multiple hires.

Reduces backandforth while avoiding a public job board.

C\) Checkout & Payment Flow (Buyer experience)

Select Offer: Choose package or base rate duration; pick extras and
license tier.

Pick Date/Time: Required; availability filter helps show open slo
