• Playbooks per role: Eng, PM, Design, Support, Trust, Finance.

Processes & cadences:\
• Weekly business review: KPIs, incidents, error budgets, experiments,
city gating decisions.\
• Squad rituals: daily standups, mid‑week demos behind flags, Friday
retros; shared ship log.\
• Risk review: T&S, Finance, and Legal sign‑off for changes that alter
policy, money movement, or public content rules.\
• Post‑incident reviews: timelines, user impact, root causes,
code/config changes, owner, and follow‑ups.

Success metrics:\
• Ramp to first merged PR/flag flip; progression to on‑call;
comprehension quizzes on policy and safety; audit of first admin
actions.

Top risks & mitigations:\
• Paper onboarding; no admin access; cowboy changes; missing safety
drills; no understanding of receipts/tax.

assignments; 30‑60‑90 plans.

Deep dive: Case study --- Houston Alpha: How the team used feature flags
and admin tools to run a safe Instant Book pilot without code changes
mid‑flight.\
We document the detection signals, the decision tree, the admin actions
available, and the roll‑forward/roll‑back conditions. Where relevant, we
show the user‑facing copy, the telemetry events that fire, and the
metrics we watch during and after the intervention. Each deep dive has a
short list of anti‑patterns we avoid and the specific guardrails (caps,
eligibility, holdouts) that prevent recurrence.

Deep dive: Scenario --- ACH returns spike: How Finance and Support
coordinate, which macros they use, and how the buyer‑fee discount copy
changes temporarily.\
We document the detection signals, the decision tree, the admin actions
available, and the roll‑forward/roll‑back conditions. Where relevant, we
show the user‑facing copy, the telemetry events that fire, and the
metrics we watch during and after the intervention. Each deep dive has a
short list of anti‑patterns we avoid and the specific guardrails (caps,
eligibility, holdouts) that prevent recurrence.

Deep dive: Scenario --- Promotions abuse attempt: How invalid‑click
detection works, how credits are auto‑applied, and when Trust pauses
paid delivery for an account.\
We document the detection signals, the decision tree, the admin actions
available, and the roll‑forward/roll‑back conditions. Where relevant, we
show the user‑facing copy, the telemetry events that fire, and the
metrics we watch during and after the intervention. Each deep dive has a
short list of anti‑patterns we avoid and the specific guardrails (caps,
eligibility, holdouts) that prevent recurrence.

Deep dive: Scenario --- Background check adverse action: FCRA steps,
Smart Docs templates, notice timing, and how the reputation score decays
and recovers.\
We document the detection signals, the decision tree, the admin actions
available, and the roll‑forward/roll‑back conditions. Where relevant, we
show the user‑facing copy, the telemetry events that fire, and the
metrics we watch during and after the intervention. Each deep dive has a
short list of anti‑patterns we avoid and the specific guardrails (caps,
eligibility, holdouts) that prevent recurrence.

Deep dive: Scenario --- LBG refund split: How a partial refund on the
studio leg coexists with a completed talent leg, and how amended
receipts are generated.\
We document the detection signals, the decision tree, the admin actions
available, and the roll‑forward/roll‑back conditions. Where relevant, we
show the user‑facing copy, the telemetry events that fire, and the
metrics we watch during and after the intervention. Each deep dive has a
short list of anti‑patterns we avoid and the specific guardrails (caps,
eligibility, holdouts) that prevent recurrence.

Deep dive: Scenario --- Content safety override: Artistic nude flagged
by the classifier; Trust review, override with reason, and model's
Safe‑Mode default.\
We document the detection sign
