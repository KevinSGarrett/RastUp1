I\) Tax Center (USfirst) --- Expanded with automation & compliance

Profiles & Onboarding

W9 collection (electronic): guided web form for U.S. persons/entities;
captures all W9 fields + perjury declaration + esignature; stores signed
form; versioning on updates.

TIN match (soft): background name/TIN validation; surface "Mismatch ---
please correct" banner to reduce 1099 errors.

Blocking rule: payouts are blocked until a valid W9 is on file (prevents
backup withholding complexity).

Edelivery consent: toggle & capture consent log for electronic delivery
of yearend forms; fallback to paper mail only if required.

Marketplace Sales Tax (explainer tile)

"We're required by state marketplace facilitator laws to collect and
remit sales tax on taxable transactions in many states. Taxes are
computed automatically at checkout based on service location and
state/local rules."

Link: "View where we collect tax" → knowledge base list
(automaintained).

YearEnd Forms (1099)

Thresholdaware messaging: dynamic banners ("On track to receive a Form
1099NEC this year" or "Below threshold; no form expected") driven by
current IRS guidance (configurable---no hardcoded amounts).

Automated generation: system compiles annual earnings (gross), uses
stored W9, and generates 1099 forms (efile to IRS + states via provider;
Combined Federal/State Filing where supported).

Delivery: issue PDF in Tax Center (by Jan 31); notify via email/app; if
no edelivery consent or not accessed by a cutoff, trigger paper mail via
provider.

Status chips: Not required • Pending • Issued; download history
retained.

Summaries & Exports

Annual summaries: gross earnings, fees, refunds, adjustments, reserves
(for personal bookkeeping).

Exports: month/quarter CSV of gross, fees, refunds, adjustments,
reserves.

Disclaimers

"We don't provide tax advice; consult a tax professional."

J\) Chargebacks, Holds & Deposits

Chargebacks (buyerside): show case status & timeline; link to Support
case; note temporary payout holds when applicable.

Seller/Host view: representment status; attached evidence; estimated
decision window.

Deposits (studio): show authorization, expiry, capture/void/release;
deposit capture generates separate receipt (no platform fee).

K\) Notifications

Buyer: payment success/failure, ACH verified, refund issued, chargeback
opened/closed.

Seller/Host: bank verified, payout queued/sent/failed, reserve changes,
Early Payout executed, chargeback opened.

Tax: W9 needed, W9 mismatch, edelivery consent needed, yearend form
available.

All notifications are SFW and privacysafe.

L\) Security, Privacy & Compliance --- Expanded

PCI DSS: handled by processor; we store only tokens.

KYC/KYB: processorhosted flows (name, DOB, EIN, beneficial owners for
entities).

PII minimization: TINs and sensitive tax data encrypted at rest
(fieldlevel), with separate key vault; strict RBAC; admin access
justified and audited.

W9 esignature compliance: electronic W9 flow meets IRS requirements
(capture consent, signature intent, full form fields, tamperevidence,
reproducible PDF).

Edelivery compliance: capture affirmative consent; provide online
access; allow optout; mail paper if consent not given or undeliverable.

Audit trail: tax engine calls (request/response summaries), tax lines
per receipt, W9 versions, TIN match results (nonsensitive codes), 1099
issuance logs, edelivery view events.

Data retention: retain W9 and 1099 records per federal/state
requirements; purge on schedule after statutory window.

Safe Mode: billing/tax emails never include explicit previews; receipts
show only SFW descriptions.

M\) Accessibility & Performance

Keyboardable forms; clear labels; ARIA for steppers/tables; highcontrast
charts.
