City‑first artifacts (press kit, creator ambassadors,
studio partners) prepared in §10.1 runbook.\
• Post‑Launch: 7/30/90‑day reviews convert observations into roadmap
changes; flags let us tune by city without forks.

Implementation Notes:\
• Flag Discipline: Each capability ships behind a named flag with a
runbook, owner, rollback, and blast‑radius notes. Flags default to
\'off\' in new cities.\
• Admin Operability: No workstream is \'done\' until admin tools enable
Support/Trust/Finance to handle the top 3 edge cases without
engineering.\
• Copy & Policy: All flows have help‑center articles and email/SMS
templates; copy avoids legalese and links to policy examples.\
• QA & Drills: Staging mimics production data shapes; drills include
processor/tax outages, moderation surges, and incident command
handoffs.\
• Experimentation: Features that affect marketplace economics (ranking,
boosts, fees) include holdouts and guardrails; we measure incremental
impact.\
• Data Wiring: Events land in Bronze/Silver/Gold (§5); KPIs pull only
from Gold with freshness SLOs. Definitions live in a metrics catalog.\
• Accessibility: New UI complies with WCAG 2.1 AA; screen‑reader and
keyboard paths verified; contrast ratios checked; defects triaged.\
• Security & Privacy: PII masked by default; JIT elevation for sensitive
admin actions; vendor scopes minimal; audits immutable.\
• City Readiness: City‑first artifacts (press kit, creator ambassadors,
studio partners) prepared in §10.1 runbook.\
• Post‑Launch: 7/30/90‑day reviews convert observations into roadmap
changes; flags let us tune by city without forks.

Roadmap Disclaimer: This is an internal planning document. Dates are
placeholders and will firm up as Section 5 telemetry validates
conversion and quality gates. All items ship behind flags and city
allowlists. Nothing herein creates external commitments.

Context & Alignment: US‑only creative marketplace; subscription‑free at
launch; monetization via take‑rate and usage‑based promotions with
eligibility gates and strict caps; public content limited to
artistic‑only (guest Safe‑Mode on by default); deliverables handled via
external links (Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests; escrowed
payments released on acceptance; Instant Book gated by ID verification;
optional background checks confer Trusted Pro; city‑gated rollout with
feature flags; strong Admin Console with least‑privilege, JIT elevation,
two‑person approvals, and immutable audits.

Timeframe & Scope:\
• City‑gated public beta in Houston; T0 to T+90.

Goals:\
• Prove conversion at city scale while keeping safety and money stable.\
• Enable verification gating (IDV→Instant Book; Trusted Pro optional
with FCRA playbook).\
• Finalize change orders, travel fees, and time‑band cancellation logic;
improve manifest UX.

Product Themes:\
• Quality supply and fast path to first booking; clear money math and
schedules.

Workstreams & Deliverables:\
• IDV production; Instant Book eligibility; Trusted Pro flow; reputation
score and search tie‑break.\
• Change orders and reschedule; travel fee calculator by radius/zip;
deposits (studios not yet).\
• Refund calculators; tax allowlist (Texas) on; receipts itemize fees
and taxes; ACH discount visible.\
• Safety: harassment macros; rate limits; reporting; appeals; Safe‑Mode
hardening.

Feature Flags & City Gates:\
• feature.idv.prod, feature.instant_book, feature.travel.calculator,
feature.refund.calculator, feature.tax.allowlist=TX.

Dependencies & Inputs:\
• Processor production; tax engine; comms; support staffing; moderation
staffing; studios partner outreach groundwork.

Top Risks & Mitigations:\
• Moderation backlog; tax errors; money reconciliation variance;
chargeback narratives; harassment waves.

Instrumentation & KPIs:\
• City S→I ≥ 20%; I→B ≥ 35
