>\$1,000) bookings.\
• Promotions ROI: Using holdouts, estimate incremental GMV from paid
exposure. Attribute revenue to promotions net of invalid‑click credits.
Ensure quality score and eligibility keep paid from cannibalizing
organic relevance.\
• Sensitivity toggles: Vary ACH adoption (10--40%), chargebacks
(0.2--0.6%), cancellations (3--10%), and promotions adoption (5--25%) to
see contribution margin swings.\
• City expansion: Add a second city with a 3--6 month lag. Reuse
maturation curves and observe shared services leverage (support, SRE).

Financial Modeling Disclaimer: This section provides planning
assumptions, formulas, and structures for internal modeling. It is not a
forecast or financial advice. All sample numbers are illustrative;
replace with real inputs once telemetry in §5 is live.

Context & Alignment: We operate a US‑only creative marketplace
connecting models, photographers, videographers, and content creators
with buyers and studios. Launch strategy is subscription‑free;
monetization is via take‑rate on bookings and usage‑based promotions
(capped, labeled, eligibility‑gated). Public content is artistic‑only;
deliverables use external storage with immutable manifests. Instant Book
requires ID verification; background checks are opt‑in (Trusted Pro).
ACH reduces buyer fee to 3% where enabled. Feature flags and city gates
control rollout; admin tools and audits turn policy into software.

Goals:\
• Ensure 18--24 months of runway with conservative burn; tie hiring and
marketing unlocks to concrete milestones.\
• Define the metrics that unlock seed extension or Series A.\
• Provide a clear \'stop‑spend\' protocol if KPIs regress.

Key variables & baselines:\
• Starting cash: Seed proceeds net of fees; maintain minimum cash
covenant target.\
• Milestones: Beta KPIs (§6.2), GA KPIs (§6.3), City‑3 scale (§6.4),
promotions ROAS, tax coverage states.\
• Buffers: 3‑month buffer for city slips; vendor prepayments under
review.

Core formulas (structure; plug real telemetry later):\
• Runway_months = Cash / MonthlyBurn (rolling 3‑month average)\
• HiringUnlock = 1 if (GMV growth & conversion KPIs ≥ thresholds) else
0\
• MarketingUnlock = 1 if (CAC_payback ≤ 12 months & ROAS ≥ target) else
0

Unlock criteria:\
We hire ahead only when revenue and trust metrics are sustainably on
track. Promotions GA scales when ROAS holds with caps.

Stop‑spend protocol:\
If two consecutive months miss red‑line KPIs, we pause hiring, reduce
paid marketing, and focus on conversion and trust fixes.

Investor narrative:\
We present a measured plan: city‑by‑city wins, strong NPS among
creators, and usage‑based monetization with fairness guardrails.

Instrumentation & success metrics:\
• Runway months; burn multiple; EBITDA trend; CAC payback; ROAS; GMV per
active buyer/provider; NPS\
• Trust/share: IDV %, Trusted Pro %, safety reports per 1k legs; payout
latency; chargeback loss rate

Top risks & mitigations:\
• Over‑optimistic hiring → tie to unlock rules; publish \'freeze\'
triggers\
• Unexpected processor fee hikes → multi‑processor readiness; ACH mix
push

Acceptance checklist:\
□ Runway calculator live; unlock/ freeze rules documented; comms plan
for spend changes.\
□ Board dashboard includes red/yellow/green gates on milestones.\
□ Cash reconciliation to bank statements completed monthly.

Modeling Deep‑Dive:\
• Scenario setup: Define a city cohort with starting supply and demand,
apply search→inquiry and inquiry→booking rates from §6.2/§6.3, then
layer on cancellations, lateness, and chargebacks. Compute GMV per
cohort and pass it through fee structure, taxes, and processor costs.\
• Unit economics: For a representative \$X booking, compute provider fee
(12%), buyer fee (5% or 3% with ACH), and processing cost. Show platform
net before variable ops (content safety scans, IDV/BG subsidies). Repeat
