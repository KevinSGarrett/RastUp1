owner, a definition of the
denominator, and a weekly narrative. • Risk reviews pair with §10
post‑launch 7/30/90‑day reviews and §8 compliance calendar. • Where a
risk spans multiple squads, the city GM or Risk DRI chairs the review;
actions have due dates. • We prefer reversible changes (flags) and
narrow blast radius (city gates). • We avoid \'security by obscurity\';
we publish clear user guidance, train staff, and keep audit trails for
all sensitive actions. • The risk register itself is versioned; changes
record rationale and observed metrics.

Roadmap Disclaimer: This is an internal planning document. Dates are
placeholders and will firm up as Section 5 telemetry validates
conversion and quality gates. All items ship behind flags and city
allowlists. Nothing herein creates external commitments.

Context & Alignment: US‑only creative marketplace; subscription‑free at
launch; monetization via take‑rate and usage‑based promotions with
eligibility gates and strict caps; public content limited to
artistic‑only (guest Safe‑Mode on by default); deliverables handled via
external links (Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests; escrowed
payments released on acceptance; Instant Book gated by ID verification;
optional background checks confer Trusted Pro; city‑gated rollout with
feature flags; strong Admin Console with least‑privilege, JIT elevation,
two‑person approvals, and immutable audits.

Timeframe & Scope:\
• Applies across all phases; updated quarterly after 7/30/90‑day
reviews.

Goals:\
• Ship trust‑critical features early; avoid scaling without safety and
money readiness.\
• Prefer reversible, city‑gated changes; use flags and holdouts for
anything that touches ranking or money.\
• Instrument everything; decisions follow data from §5 dashboards, not
anecdotes.

Product Themes:\
• Trust‑First UX: IDV→Instant Book, Safe‑Mode default, clear
deliverables manifest, transparent fees.\
• Fair Discovery: relevance first; paid boosts capped, labeled, and
eligibility‑gated.\
• Creator Earnings: faster time‑to‑first booking; simple change‑orders;
clear travel fees; Early Payout (per‑use).\
• Operational Excellence: admin operability; two‑person approvals;
immutable audits; status page discipline.\
• City‑by‑City: runbooks, founding perks, local studios and ambassadors,
metrics gates.\
• Sustainable Monetization: take‑rate first; usage‑based promotions;
defer subscriptions until liquidity is proven.

Workstreams & Deliverables:\
• Profiles & Search (role‑aware, social metrics, presets).\
• Booking & Money (escrow, change orders, travel fees, tax engine
allowlists).\
• Messaging & Collaboration (threads, file manifests, checklists).\
• Trust & Safety (IDV/BG, moderation, Safe‑Mode, appeals).\
• Promotions (CPC/Featured v1 with caps, QS, holdouts).\
• Studios (phase‑gated, deposit rules, house rules, verified badge).\
• Analytics & Admin (dashboards, flags, incident drills).

Feature Flags & City Gates:\
• feature.idv.instant_book, feature.promotions.v1, feature.studio.beta,
feature.group_checkout, feature.lbg_receipt, city.{HOU,DAL,AUS}
allowlists.

Dependencies & Inputs:\
• Vendors: processor(s), ACH, tax engine, IDV, BG, e‑signature, comms.
Internal: §5 data; §4 admin; §8 policy; §10 playbooks.

Top Risks & Mitigations:\
• Over‑scope early phases; promotions perceived as pay‑to‑win; tax
misconfig; moderation backlog; processor outage.

Instrumentation & KPIs:\
• S→I, I→B, time‑to‑first booking, dispute loss rate, payout latency,
IDV %, Trusted Pro %, promotions ROAS, no‑results rate, tax variance.
