void doublebooking.

7\) Payments & escrow for travel

Travel fees are part of the escrow amount and follow the same
cancellation/dispute policy as the job (unless flagged as nonrefundable
expenses after tickets/hotels are purchased with buyer approval).

For expenses at cost workflows (flight/hotel receipts): provider uploads
receipts → buyer approves → platform charges card and adds to escrow or
settles as a postcheckout extra.

8\) UI copy (concise and proactive)

Search chips: "Local (≤ 25 mi)", "Include traveling talent".

Result badges: "Travel required---Request to Book", "Visiting your city
on \[dates\]".

Checkout: "Travel fee calculated from distance/time using talent's
policy," (ⓘ) tooltip with formula.

Longhaul panel: "This booking requires travel arrangements
(flight/hotel/perdiem). Send a request to confirm details."

9\) Acceptance criteria (travel)

SPs can configure Included radius, Travel pricing model, Longhaul
threshold/rules, and Instant Book limits.

Search respects radius by default and clearly marks travelrequired
results.

Checkout computes travel fee via distance/time API and shows a
transparent line item.

Longhaul disables Instant Book, requires RequesttoBook, and surfaces
travel rules.

"Local ride credit" addon supported; no rideshare booking in MVP.

(Phase2) Can attach Uber/Lyft vouchers for enterprise buyers.

Addendum to §1.3 --- Contracts, Releases & Paperwork (Templates,
Requirements, Signatures) --- FINAL

Goal: Make paperwork automatic, standardized, and enforceable---so
deliverables, rights, and usage are crystal clear without forcing every
user to lawyer up.

A\) Smart Docs Engine (builtin, templatefirst)

Autoattach at booking: Based on roles in the booking, the platform
attaches a default pack of documents (below) prefilled with names,
dates, location, deliverables, fees, and licensing.

Esign builtin: Simple, legally binding esign (draw/type) with audit
trail (IP, timestamp, device).

Bringyourown: Providers/brands may upload custom addenda (PDF/DOCX) to
sign in the same flow.

Jurisdiction & minors: City/state choice adjusts venue law; minor flag
adds guardian consent + stricter photo policy.

B\) Minimum Document Set (autoselected)

Service Agreement / SOW (always): scope, timeline, payment schedule,
revisions, cancellation, dispute venue.

License/Usage Addendum (if media usage): media types, geos, durations,
paid vs organic, exclusivity options, optional workforhire clause.

Model Release (if any model present): publicity rights grant; adult vs
minor variants; explicit nopornography covenant.

Property/Studio Release (if private or providerowned space): permission
to shoot, house rules, damages.

NDA (optional toggle from buyer): mutual or oneway.

Safety Addendum (if Nudity Tier \> Lingerie): attire/coverage, chaperone
policy, changing/privacy, closed set, onsite contact.

Defaults are editable by parties before signing; diffs logged.

C\) When Are Docs Required?

Before checkin. All required docs must be esigned by both parties before
"Start" can be tapped in the app.

Brief stage: Buyers see the default pack preview on the brief; providers
see it when quoting.

No "paperless" bookings where releases are expected (e.g., shoots with
models).

D\) Enforceability Hooks

Escrow gating: Funds won't release until required docs are signed and
deliverables accepted.

Deliverables manifest references the SOW + License; disputes use these
as source of truth.

Audit trail: Signed PDFs with hash, IP/device/timestamps downloadable by
both parties.

E\) Special Cases

TFP/Collab mode: SOW + noncommercial license by default; optional
upgrade to commercial later (with price).

Fansubscription creators: Adds Posting & Attribution Addendum (see §3.5
addendum) detailing deadlines and minimum live duration; autoverify
posts via OAuth/URL.

Minors: Guardian esign required; extra safety terms; no nudity tiers
available.

Union/agency talent: Upload agency rider; overrides conflicting defaults
