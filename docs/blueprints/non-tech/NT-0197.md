 v2) complete.

Admin tools for LBG timelines, deposits, promos config, and tax map
live; all actions audited.

GA KPIs (above) met or trending for 4 consecutive weeks; City2 pilot
activated behind gates.

K\) Why this works

Delivers the complete, twosided value: talent + space in one flow, with
clear money and safety controls.

Keeps monetization usagebased and fair, measured by incrementality.

Adds ML carefully, inside guardrails and with instant rollback.

Scales citybycity with knobs for promotions, tax, and studios---without
rearchitecting core flows.

Layer Owner Frequency Checks (examples) Action if fail

SDK/Edge Eng (client + collector) Per request JSON Schema (§5.1), size
limits, PII filter, idempotent event_id 4xx to SDK; drop event; counter
in Observability

Bus Data Eng Continuous Topic name valid, partition key presence,
backlog/lag SLO Scale consumers; alert on lag

Bronze Data Eng Continuous Schema validate, dedup by event_id, partition
landed DLQ family; red badge on Bronze freshness

Silver Data Eng 1--5 min Type/enum coercion, FK existence within
lookback, late event watermark windows Quarantine record; alert if FK
miss \> threshold

Gold (finance) Data Eng + Finance Nightly Aggregation math,
reconciliation vs settlements, deposit lifecycle consistency Gate close;
page Finance & SRE

Gold (product) Data Eng + Analytics Hourly Invariants (rates in
\[0,1\]), status transitions sane, SCD2 gaps Mark tiles "At Risk"; open
data issue

Semantic/BI Analytics Querytime + nightly Metric definition hash match,
ratio recomputation, freshness badge Block tile or show stale banner

Exports Data Eng Nightly Privacy: masked views only; watermark stamping;
row counts Cancel export; alert Privacy

Severity Examples Action

P0 (Blocker) Settlement recon variance \> 0.5%; charge lines don't sum;
payout negative; privacy breach detection Gate finance close; disable
payouts; page Finance/SRE/Privacy; incident opened

P1 (Critical) Freshness \> 60 min; orphan legs \> 0; deposit math
invalid; invalid clicks \> 15% cityday Mark finance tiles "At Risk";
pause promotions in affected city; alert owners

P2 (Warning) Freshness 15--60 min; slight schema drift handled; drift in
search CTR Add yellow badge on tiles; Jira to data owner; monitor

Scenario Use REPLAY (events) Use BACKFILL (tables)

Late/missing events from clients/services ✅ Reemit the original events
with same event_id (or a replay key) ❌

Schema evolution (new optional fields in events) ✅ Reprocess historical
events through new transforms ❌

Transform bug in Silver/Gold logic ⚠️ Replay optional; usually redo
Silver/Gold backfill for affected dates ✅

Finance/tax corrections (allocations, settlements) ❌ ✅ Reclose
impacted partitions + write adjustment ledger

SCD2 dimension errors (profile policy/price) ❌ ✅ Rebuild SCD2 from CDC
snapshots

External vendor refresh (tax, background, social metrics) ❌ ✅ Import
vendor snapshot + recompute dependent facts

Partition/layout changes (cost/perf) ❌ ✅ Rematerialize tables, no
semantic change (rowforrow parity)

Adapter SLA Monitoring Failover

Payments (S1) 99.9% webhooks; \<2s checkout Synthetic charges; recon
variance alarms Retry queues; allow card fallback if ACH down

Tax (S1) \<500ms calc Latency, exception rate Softfail banner; block
where legally required

IDV (S2) 95% \< 10min decision Queue age, error codes Retry; escalate to
manual review

BG (S2) Varies by provider Aging cases Pause badge if stale; notify user

Social (S2) Nightly success Quota errors, success counts Backoff;
surface "stale" badge in UI

Content Scan (S2) \<5min per asset Backlog, decision rates Quarantine
until result

ESign (S2) \<1h turnaround typical Envelope status Manual upload
fallback

Comms (S2) 99% send Bounce/complaint rates Switch provider channel if
outage

Data product Grain SLO Hard deadline Weekly error budget

Silver Ops Tables (search/msg/booking/promotions) streaming \< 15 min
p95 lag 30 min 60 min/city
