 remove low‑value filters; increase
presets.\
• Deliverables tutorial video; acceptance window guidance; macro for
\'how manifests work\'.\
• DM spam spike: tighten sends; require IDV for outreach; adjust credits
per §3.2 launch spec.

RACI / Owners:\
• Product (Profiles/Search/Booking), Design, Data, Trust liaison,
Support.

Instrumentation & success metrics:\
• S→I and I→B per role; click‑through from tabs; change order
on‑platform rate vs off‑platform signals.\
• Dispute rate \'not as described\'; manifest completion rate; feed
engagement health.

Thresholds & triggers (Go/No‑Go, rollback, escalation):\
• Drop in S→I \> 10% over 7 days; feed hide rate \> threshold;
off‑platform signals increase.

Dependencies & assumptions:\
• Role‑aware profiles (§1.1), search filters (§1.2), deliverables
(§3.6), messaging (§1.4), analytics (§1.6).

Acceptance checklist (risk under control when):\
□ Role tabs and separate reviews confirmed; presets live; tooltips
tested with users.\
□ Change order UX integrated; macros and help content published;
telemetry validated.

Scenario Deep‑Dive --- Search paralysis:\
Context: Buyers apply too many filters, zero results.\
Trigger: No‑results rate up in key cohorts.\
Immediate actions: Suggest relaxations; show \'near matches\'; auto‑save
boards for later.\
Communication: In‑UI nudges; help article link.\
Rollback/Forward: Restore stricter defaults if irrelevant results rise.\
Owner: Search PM \| Telemetry: no_results_rate, CTR \| Evidence: Filter
combinations; session replays (privacy‑safe)

Execution Notes:\
• Every risk has a dashboard tile with an owner, a definition of the
denominator, and a weekly narrative. • Risk reviews pair with §10
post‑launch 7/30/90‑day reviews and §8 compliance calendar. • Where a
risk spans multiple squads, the city GM or Risk DRI chairs the review;
actions have due dates. • We prefer reversible changes (flags) and
narrow blast radius (city gates). • We avoid \'security by obscurity\';
we publish clear user guidance, train staff, and keep audit trails for
all sensitive actions. • The risk register itself is versioned; changes
record rationale and observed metrics.
