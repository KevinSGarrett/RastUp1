 of local counsel; rushed enablement.

Leading indicators & early warning signals:\
• No‑results rate; S→I and I→B by district; studio attach rate; waitlist

ambassadors.\

community events; ROAS‑proven promotions.\
• City allowlist; local counsel; studio verification; phased feature
enablement.

Incident playbooks (summary):\
• Thin supply: focus invites, perks; adjust floors; partner with
studios; PR push with ambassadors.\
• PR backlash: publish examples; enforce policy consistently; avoid
adversarial tone; spotlight safety.\
• Competitor move: emphasize escrow, contracts, trust signals, and
fairness of promotions; not a race to the bottom.

RACI / Owners:\
• City GM, Growth, Trust, Legal, Studios PM.

Instrumentation & success metrics:\
• Coverage heatmaps; conversion by area; PR sentiment; share of wallet
among active providers; event attendance.

Thresholds & triggers (Go/No‑Go, rollback, escalation):\
• City expansion blocked if conversion or safety below thresholds for 4
weeks.\
• PR negativity above threshold triggers comms and creator outreach
plan.

Dependencies & assumptions:\
• §2 GTM plan; §3 monetization; §4 studios; §10 city turn‑up; §8 legal
posture.

effect.\
Owner: Growth/GM \| Telemetry: provider_churn, bookings_share \|
Evidence: Exit surveys; earnings comparisons

Execution Notes:\
• Every risk has a dashboard tile with an owner, a definition of the
denominator, and a weekly narrative. • Risk reviews pair with §10
post‑launch 7/30/90‑day reviews and §8 compliance calendar. • Where a
risk spans multiple squads, the city GM or Risk DRI chairs the review;
actions have due dates. • We prefer reversible changes (flags) and
narrow blast radius (city gates). • We avoid \'security by obscurity\';
we publish clear user guidance, train staff, and keep audit trails for
all sensitive actions. • The risk register itself is versioned; changes
record rationale and observed metrics.
