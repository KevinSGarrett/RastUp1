gs. We test under simulated load, outage, and edge cases
(ACH returns, 3DS failures, moderation queue spikes).\
• Holdouts & Experiments: Promotions, ranking, and any economic nudges
run with control cells and pre‑registered guardrails. We pause
experiments when guardrails breach.\
• Close‑the‑Loop: Post‑launch, we hold 7/30/90‑day reviews that tie
metrics to actions and retire ineffective steps.

Implementation Notes:\
• Flags & City Gates: Every user‑visible change ships behind a flag with
a documented blast radius, an owner, and a rollback plan. City
allowlists prevent accidental national exposure. Admin has kill‑switches
for money and safety features with two‑person approval.\
• Admin Operability: No checklist is \'done\' unless Support can resolve
the top 3 edge cases without engineering and Trust can perform required
actions with an audit trail.\
• Help‑Center Alignment: All user‑facing copy is mirrored in the help
center with last‑updated dates and visual examples. We avoid legal
jargon; we explain outcomes and next steps.\
• QA Strategy: We prefer production‑like staging with seeded data and
synthetic bookings. We test under simulated load, outage, and edge cases
(ACH returns, 3DS failures, moderation queue spikes).\
• Holdouts & Experiments: Promotions, ranking, and any economic nudges
run with control cells and pre‑registered guardrails. We pause
experiments when guardrails breach.\

guide. It is not a public policy document. Where compliance or legal
actions are required, consult Section 8 and counsel. Where money flows
change, consult Sections 3 and 4.

Context & Alignment: Our launch approach is city‑by‑city with nationwide
signups allowed, starting in Houston. We launch subscription‑free,
monetize through take‑rate and usage‑based promotions with strict
eligibility and caps, and keep public media within an artistic‑only
boundary with Safe‑Mode defaults for guests. Deliverables are handled
via external links (Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests. Instant
Book requires ID verification; background checks are opt‑in (Trusted
Pro). Payments include card (3DS when required) and ACH (with a reduced
buyer fee). Feature flags and city gates control blast radius, and the
Admin Console enables Support, Trust, Finance, and Ops to act without
code changes.

Goals:\
• Equip Support to resolve the majority of issues without engineering.\
• Publish macros, calculators, and knowledge so outcomes are consistent
and fast.\
• Measure and staff to SLAs that match city hours and expected volume.

Tooling & Macros:\
□ Refund calculator integrated; partial and multi‑leg support; time‑band
logic.\
□ Dispute intake wizard; chargeback evidence builder; attachment
checklist.\
□ Moderation escalation buttons; PII redaction; account limits
controls.\
□ DM limits and spam controls; identity re‑verification triggers.

Knowledge Base:\
□ Top 50 issues covered; plain‑English answers; screenshots of admin
steps.\
□ Money articles: refunds, tax, deposits, chargebacks; trust articles:
Safe‑Mode, IDV, BG.\
□ City‑specific FAQs: perks, studios, accessibility info.

Staffing & SLAs:\
□ Queue size forecasts; shifts aligned to city hours; escalation paths
to Trust/Finance.\
□ FRT/FRR targets by priority; on‑call coverage for incidents; training
completion records.

Owners & Roles:\
• Support lead --- macros, staffing, training.\
• Trust liaison --- safety escalations and training.\
• Finance liaison --- money macros and approvals.\
• Product --- admin feature readiness and gaps.

Instrumentation & Readiness Signals:\
• FRT/FRR; reopen rate; macro usage rate; CSAT; SLA breaches; ticket
categories and trends.\
• Deflection: % resolved via knowl
