C\) Checkout & Payment Flow (Buyer experience)

Select Offer: Choose package or base rate duration; pick extras and
license tier.

Pick Date/Time: Required; availability filter helps show open slots.

Location: Address or "studio provided by talent" if applicable; travel
fee dynamically calculated if the SP adds permile pricing.

Contract Pack (autoattached):

Booking Agreement (scope, deliverables, schedule, payment terms,
cancellation, safety rules).

Usage License (for photographer/videographer deliverables; simple,
prepriced tiers).

Model Release (autoattached if booking a model).

Content Promotion Terms (for Creators: posting timeline, tag/credit
rules).

Summary & Fees: Subtotal, platform fees (see §E), taxes (if any), and
escrow notice.

Pay & Confirm: Card or bank method; funds moved to escrow; confirmation
screen and email. Calendar blocks for both parties; chat opens.

Tip: Show a small "What you get" panel (deliverables, revisions,
turnaround, license) and a separate "What's not included" to reduce
postshoot disputes.

D\) Escrow, Release, and Payouts (Money movement)

Escrow on Accept/Book: Buyer is charged; funds held in custodial escrow.

Completion signal:

Timebased jobs (e.g., hiring a model): Provider taps "Completed" after
session; client has 24--48h to confirm or raise a dispute.

Deliverablebased jobs (e.g., photo/video/creator posts): Provider marks
individual milestones (Shoot done → Proofs delivered → Finals delivered)
or single "Delivered" if simple. Client has review window per milestone.

Autorelease: If no dispute is opened by the end of the window, payout is
autoreleased.

Payout timing:

Standard: Release 48h after completion confirmation (or window expiry).

New provider risk policy: First X payouts delayed up to 7 days or
reserve % held to reduce chargeback/fraud risk; relax as reputation
builds.

Payout methods: Bank transfer (ACH) primary; backup options (PayPal,
etc.).

Tips: After completion (or milestone), buyer can add a tip (0% platform
fee on tips to encourage generosity).

E\) Fee & Pricing Strategy (Revenue model)

Goal: be simpler and fairer than legacy directories, with enough margin
to fund verification, support, and growth.

Recommended baseline (US launch):

Provider fee (commission): 12% of booking subtotal.

Buyer service fee: 5% (min \$2).

Processing costs: Covered within these fees (we keep the math simple for
users).

Elastic incentives (drive behaviors we want):

Instant Book discount: Provider fee -- 1% on Instant Book transactions
(promotes "buy now").

Verified boosts: Backgroundchecked providers get --0.5% fee and ranking
boost (ties to Trust incentives).

Highvalue tiering: For any single booking subtotal \> \$1,000, provider
fee on the portion above that drops to 10%.

Alternatives to test (A/B later):

15% provider, 0% buyer (simpler, common in marketplaces).

8% provider, 7% buyer (shifts load to buyer; sometimes better acceptance
with pros).

We'll start with the baseline, track conversion and sentiment, and
optimize. Promotions (e.g., zero buyer fee for first booking) can
accelerate adoption.

F\) Changes, Overtime & OnSet Additions

Overtime: In booking thread, either party can propose overtime in
30/60min increments at a preset rate; both tap to confirm; card is
incrementally charged; calendar extended.

Extras after checkout: Provider can offer postcheckout extras (e.g.,
"+10 edits") as onetap upsells; buyer approves & pays.

Travel/expenses: Preapproved extras (travel miles, parking, studio
rental). For adhoc expenses: upload receipt → buyer approves (or
dispute) → charge processed.

G\) Rescheduling & Cancellations (Policies)

Providers choose one of three policy templates per SP (or per package)
