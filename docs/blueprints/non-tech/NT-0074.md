e budgets: keyboardable filters, strong
contrast, TTI \< 2.5s on 3G Fast, route codesplitting.

Cityaware: location chips, city selector, and saved searches all obey
the current city context.

D\) Global flows (from first visit to review)

Discover → Home/Category/Case Studies → Search (role selector + filters)
→ Profile/Listing card → Message or Instant Book.

Plan → Brief (Quick/Full) → smart invites/RFP → Compare & Boards →
Award.

Book → Checkout (escrow, docs) → (optional) Attach a Studio → Payment →
confirmation.

Work → Thread (prep) → Checkin/out (time evidence) → Delivery Room →
Acceptance.

Close → Payout → Doubleblind Reviews → Reputation updates → Growth loops
(follow/favorite/feed/case study).

If needed → Refund/Dispute/Safety → outcome per matrix with evidence.

F\) Navigation model (the contract; full spec later in §4.1)

Desktop header: Logo • Browse (roles + Verified Studios (Lite)) • Search
• Boards/Packages (context) • Messages • Notifications • Create • Safe
Mode toggle • City • Account.

Mobile tab bar: Home • Search • Create • Messages • Profile.

Create adapts: Buyer (Brief), Seller (Package/Post), Host (Studio
Listing).

G\) Ranking & fairness contract

Result order = relevance → availability → distance → price fit → Rep
tiebreak → tiny nudges (Verified/Trusted/Studio).

Promotions never bypass filters; density caps (e.g., ≤2 in top 20) and
"Promoted" labels are mandatory.

Eligibility gates: IDVerified, Rep ≥ threshold; safety strikes suppress
IB and paid delivery.

H\) Global system rules we won't violate

Separate bookings & ledgers for Talent vs Studio (even in one checkout).

Pertype policies (refunds, deposits) applied independently; the UI shows
one LBG outcome summary to the user.

No forced subscriptions at launch; monetization is takerate + optional
boosts, verification addons, and peruse Early Payout.

I\) Performance, privacy, and safety baselines

Perf: image lazyload, skeleton cards, background prefetch for next
route, defer OAuth SDKs until needed.

Privacy: exact addresses hidden until confirmation; studio surveillance
disclosures required; minors require guardian docs.

Safety: P0 hotline, checkin/out evidence, hazard toggles inject Safety
Addendum, instant IB/boost suppression during investigations.
