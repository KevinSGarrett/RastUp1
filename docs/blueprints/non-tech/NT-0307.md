• Copy Clarity: explain outcomes and next steps; avoid citing laws in
emails; link to help‑center with examples.\
• Training: quarterly refreshers for T&S, Support, Finance; FCRA basics;
chargeback representment; accessibility etiquette.\
• Measurement: we track leading/lagging indicators to tune thresholds
and staffing.

Implementation Notes:\
• Feature Flags & City Gates: externally visible policy toggles ship
behind flags; Admin can rollback with a two‑step confirmation; events
are audited.\
• Admin Operability: every rule has a corresponding tool in Admin
(approve/deny/redact/pause/escalate) with immutable logs.\
• Evidence Hygiene: store hashes and immutable links; redact PII in
views; never edit originals; legal holds override deletion where

Financial Modeling Disclaimer: This section provides planning
assumptions, formulas, and structures for internal modeling. It is not a
forecast or financial advice. All sample numbers are illustrative;
replace with real inputs once telemetry in §5 is live.

Context & Alignment: We operate a US‑only creative marketplace
connecting models, photographers, videographers, and content creators
with buyers and studios. Launch strategy is subscription‑free;

requires ID verification; background checks are opt‑in (Trusted Pro).
ACH reduces buyer fee to 3% where enabled. Feature flags and city gates
control rollout; admin tools and audits turn policy into software.

Goals:\
• Establish realistic, testable assumptions for traffic, co
