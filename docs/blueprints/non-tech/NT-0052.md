are proven, we can add an
optional Pro that power users want to pay for.

Notes for §3.1 consistency (already reflected)

Keep 12% provider / 5% buyer (min \$3; 3% ACH); Instant Book --1%,
Trusted Pro --0.5%, highvalue tier 10% above \$1,000; floor 9%.

Early Payout is peruse (0.5%) and eligibilitybased --- not tied to any
subscription.

SubSection 3.3 --- Paid Boosting & Promotions (UsageBased Only)

Goal: Unlock incremental bookings and early revenue without harming
trust or liquidity. Paid visibility is optional, eligibilitygated,
clearly labeled, and strictly capped. Organic relevance remains the
primary ranking signal. We pilot quietly (Houston) and scale only if
metrics prove netpositive.

A\) Principles (grounded in research)

Fairfirst, never paytowin. Organic ranking = query match → availability
→ distance → price fit → Rep Score. Paid units never displace more
relevant organic matches.

Eligibility before dollars. Boosts only for proven, trusted providers
(ID Verified, Rep ≥ 75, ≥2 completed onplatform bookings or ≥1 verified
reference, no active safety flags).

Transparency & control. Every paid unit is labeled Promoted with a "Why
am I seeing this?" explainer; buyers can Hide a provider and Report.

Hard caps & guardrails. Strict density, frequency, and impressionshare
caps; qualityscore weighting; misrepresentation = autopause.

Pilot, measure, earn the right to scale. Quiet Houston beta → expand
only if we hit growthsafe KPIs (organic share, buyer CTR/conv, provider
ROAS) and no trust regressions.

B\) Inventory & Placements (v1, minimal & conservative)

Search Results Boost (primary)

Placement: results list.

Format: standard profile card + Promoted chip + dynamic ribbon (e.g.,
"Instant Book", "Trusted Pro", "Available this week").

Density caps: ≤1 Promoted abovethefold, ≤2 Promoted in top 20 results.

Category / City Featured Carousels (home & landing)

Modules: "Featured in Houston", "Featured Photographers".

Slots: 10--12 cards, rotating evenly; visible only in the pilot city.

Not in v1: inbox/proposal boosting, email ads, push highlights. We do
not boost RFP proposal order or message thread ranking (avoids
"paytowin" backlash).

C\) Products & Pricing (usagebased, no bundles)

Search Boost (CPC)

Pilot floors (illustrative): TierA city (Houston) --- Models \$0.90,
Photographers \$0.70, Videographers \$0.80, Creators \$0.85.

Budgeting: daily budget + max CPC; even pacing; prepaid wallet; charge
on valid clicks only.

Ordering (within paid caps only): Score = 0.5×log(bid) +
0.5×QualityScore.

Featured Carousel (flat weekly)

Pricing: \$49--\$89 / week (Houston, by role).

Delivery: impression guarantees; rotation fairness; makegood credits if
short.

No subscriptions, no longterm commitments, no forced packs.

D\) Eligibility, Targeting & Relevance (what keeps it fair)

Eligibility: ID Verified, Rep ≥ 75, ≥2 completed bookings (or ≥1
verified reference), no active safety flags, policycompliant content.

Query matching (hard filter): role, location radius, availability
window, price range, NSFW toggle must all match; otherwise no delivery.

Audience targeting: provider may narrow by city/radius/price band;
negative keywords/genres allowed.

QualityScore (0--1): exact filter match, recent response rate/time, Rep,
Instant Book, price fit to query median, historical CTR/conv. New
boosters start at 0.5.

E\) Rotation, Frequency & ShareofShelf Caps

Frequency caps (per buyer): max 2 paid impressions/session, 5/day, 4h
cooldown per provider/buyer pair.

Provider impressionshare cap: paid impressions per provider ≤8% of all
eligible paid impressions/day (prevents domination).

Organic share guardrail (platformwide): at least 85--90% of buyer result
clicks must land on organic cards in the pilot (monitored KPI).

Roundrobin within caps: if eligible \> slots, rotate weighted by
(remaining budget × QualityScore).

F\) Provider Experience (setup → proof of value)

Setup flow: pick service profile → choose Search Boos
