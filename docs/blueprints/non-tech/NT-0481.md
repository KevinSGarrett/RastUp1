ils; we measure incremental
impact.\
• Data Wiring: Events land in Bronze/Silver/Gold (§5); KPIs pull only
from Gold with freshness SLOs. Definitions live in a metrics catalog.\
• Accessibility: New UI complies with WCAG 2.1 AA; screen‑reader and
keyboard paths verified; contrast ratios checked; defects triaged.\
• Security & Privacy: PII masked by default; JIT elevation for sensitive
admin actions; vendor scopes minimal; audits immutable.\
• City Readiness: City‑first artifacts (press kit, creator ambassadors,
studio partners) prepared in §10.1 runbook.\
• Post‑Launch: 7/30/90‑day reviews convert observations into roadmap
changes; flags let us tune by city without forks.

Roadmap Disclaimer: This is an internal planning document. Dates are
placeholders and will firm up as Section 5 telemetry validates
conversion and quality gates. All items ship behind flags and city
allowlists. Nothing herein creates external commitments.

Context & Alignment: US‑only creative marketplace; subscription‑free at
launch; monetization via take‑rate and usage‑based promotions with
eligibility gates and strict caps; public content limited to
artistic‑only (guest Safe‑Mode on by default); deliverables handled via
external links (Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests; escrowed
payments released on acceptance; Instant Book gated by ID verification;
optional background checks confer Trusted Pro; city‑gated rollout with
feature flags; strong Admin Console with least‑privilege, JIT elevation,
two‑person approvals, and immutable audits.

Timeframe & Scope:\
• T+300 to T+390 (after multi‑city GA).

Goals:\
• Deliver mobile apps that improve conversion (notifications,
availability, messaging) without diverging product logic.\
• Expose a limited partner API for brands and studios under strict
scopes and rate limits.

Product Themes:\
• Meet users where they are; keep parity with web; maintain safety and
fairness controls.

Workstreams & Deliverables:\
• iOS/Android apps: login/IDV, search, profiles, booking, messaging,
deliverables manifest review, notifications, wallet; deep links.\
• Push notifications with quiet hours; granular controls;
safety‑respecting previews.\
• Partner API: read‑only search & profile data; RFP creation; webhooks
for booking state; OAuth scopes; rate limits; abuse monitoring.

Feature Flags & City Gates:\
• feature.mobile.apps.beta=true (invite), feature.api.partner.read=true
(whitelist).

Dependencies & Inputs:\
• Mobile CI/CD; app store policies; privacy reviews; push infra; OAuth
provider; abuse detection.

Top Risks & Mitigations:\
• Notification fatigue; API misuse; mobile parity gaps; app review
delays.

Instrumentation & KPIs:\
• Mobile activation; response time; bookings initiated on mobile;
notification opt‑outs; API error/abuse rates.

Acceptance Criteria (Go/No‑Go):\
✓ Mobile NPS ≥ web; parity for core flows; API clients pass compliance;
abuse anomaly rates low.

Staffing & Ownership:\
• Mobile engineers; API/backend; Security; SRE; Product; Design;
Support.

Milestones & Checkpoints:\
• Beta → GA for apps; first partner integrations; API documentation
stable.

Implementation Notes:\
• Flag Discipline: Each capability ships behind a named flag with a
runbook, owner, rollback, and blast‑radius notes. Flags default to
\'off\' in new cities.\
• Admin Operability: No workstream is \'done\' until admin tools enable
Support/Trust/Finance to handle the top 3 edge cases without
engineering.\
• Copy & Policy: All flows have help‑center articles and email/SMS
templates; copy avoids legalese and links to policy examples.\
• QA & Drills: Staging mimics production data shapes; drills include
processor/tax outages, moderation surges, and incident command
handoffs.\
• Experimentation: Features that affect marketplace economics (ranking,
boosts, fees) include holdouts and guardrails; we
