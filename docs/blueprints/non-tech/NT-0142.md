E\) Filters, Segments & Cohorts

Global filters across dashboards: date range, city/state, role, device
type, Safe Mode (on/off exposure), verification tier, Rep decile,
acquisition channel, campaign.\
Segments: new vs returning, Verified vs unverified, Trusted Pro vs not,
IB on/off, social deciles (IG/TT/YT/X), price band.\
Cohorts: weekly signup cohort; firstbooking cohort; citylaunch cohort;
provider deciles by activity.

F\) Drilldowns & Detail Views

From tile → detail (e.g., click "Chargeback loss \$" → list of cases
with links to evidence packs).

From promotions → providerlevel ROAS & CPB; click to open their campaign
settings.

From city ratios → list of providers to invite (prefilled filters) or
studios to outreach.

G\) Exports & Scheduling

Oneclick CSV/JSON for tables; parquet for large extracts (warehouse
path).

Scheduled reports (email/Slack) with attachments or links: daily health,
weekly city ops, promos ROAS, safety SLA, finance recon, tax filings
due, support SLAs.

Access control: report subscriptions require RBAC role; PII masked
unless scope granted.

Run logs: success/failure; retry with backoff; recipients list.

H\) Alerts & Anomaly Detection

Rules (editable via §4.14.2)

Takerate drops \> 100 bps DoD in any city

Inquiry→Booking dips \< 25% for \> 24h in a city

Invalid click rate \> 10% for any provider dayoverday

Safety P0 count ≥ 3 in 24h in a city

Tax calc error rate \> 1% in any state

Payout failure rate \> 0.5% daily

Moderation removal spike \> 3× baseline houroverhour

Destinations: Slack channels (teamspecific) and email; each alert links
to the dashboard deeplink and relevant admin tool.

I\) Privacy, PII & SafeMode Display

PII masking by default; unmask requires scope + reason; downloads
watermark the requester.

SFW previews only (no explicit thumbnails in dashboards).

Aggregation thresholds: hide tiles for cohorts \< N to avoid
reidentification.

GDPR/CCPA hooks: (futureproof) report excludes deleted/anonymized users.

J\) LBG vs Leg Accounting

Toggle: "View as LBG" (grouped) vs "View legs" (talent/studio separate).

KPIs indicate which base is used (badge: LBG SUM or LEG SUM).

Exports include both views with join keys.

K\) Admin UI Patterns

Tile glossary: hover → definition, owner, metric key, last changed, link
to catalog.

Compare mode: select two cities or two periods; shows % change and
confidence bands.

Saved views: peruser saved filter sets; share links with teammates.

Notes: add annotations ("Houston buyerfee holiday started here").

Warehouse: every tile shows the dataset table/view powering it; "Open in
warehouse" (readonly for Analysts).

M\) Metrics & Quality Ops

Data QA dashboard: event drop rates, late arrivals, schema errors,
backfill status.

Reconciliation: GMV per dashboard vs finance exports; discrepancy tile
with thresholds.

Ownership: each dashboard has an owner and oncall rotation for data
quality.
