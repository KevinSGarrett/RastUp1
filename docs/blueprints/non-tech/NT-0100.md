is open.

License chip on each Final; View License opens certificate modal (terms,
project, booking ID).

UGC tracker: "Verifying post..." → "Live ✓ (48/72h remaining)" →
"Verified ✓".

M\) Notifications & Emails

Seller: "Buyer selected X proofs" • "Revision requested on N items" •
"Acceptance complete"

Buyer: "Finals ready" • "Acceptance ends in 24h" • "UGC post failed
verification (reason)"

Both: "Autoaccept in 3h" • "Links expired---action required"

Emails respect Safe Mode (no explicit previews).

N\) Metrics

Time to first delivery, time to acceptance, % autoaccept, revision rate,
firstpass acceptance rate, link failure rate, nondelivery incidents,
refund rate, UGC verification pass rate, minlive compliance rate.

Feed Reputation inputs: ontime delivery, revision compliance,
nondelivery, link reliability.

P\) Acceptance Criteria (mark 4.8 FINAL)

Delivery Room supports Proofs → Selects (optional) → Finals with peritem
comments and timecoded notes for video.

External link manifest captured (name, size, type, checksum where
available, provider, URL); no original hosting; proxies/previews only.

Autochecks run on upload/link; results shown per item; virus scan
enforced.

Acceptance window (3/7/14 days) with Autoaccept; partial acceptance
supported; payout triggers wired.

UGC/Promo verification: link ingest, API checks when available, minlive
tracking, acceptance on verify+minlive.

Revisions: at least 1 round configurable; structured change requests;
timers pause during active revision.

Downloads & watermarks: proofs watermarked; finals downloadable per
package rule; retention & "not a backup" banner visible.

Disputes: nondelivery/quality/linkexpiry flows with evidence packs;
timers & outcomes integrate with §3.9.

Safe Mode & policy: SFW previews only; FanSub Creator flows avoid
explicit media.

Telemetry & metrics instrumented as listed.

Q\) Why this works

Reduces disputes: Objective manifests, autochecks, and acceptance timers
create shared reality.

Scales cheaply: Proxies + external links avoid massive storage costs
while preserving evidence.

Fits every role: Photographers/video get proofs→finals; creators get
verified posts; studios don't carry file baggage.

Clear payout triggers: Acceptance (or verified minlive) drives
completion; LBG clarity remains intact.

§4.9 --- Messaging & Threads --- FINAL

Goal: Provide a fast, safe, and actioncentric inbox where buyers,
talent, and studio hosts coordinate work. Threads must: (1) reduce
backandforth via Quick Actions (quote, reschedule, change order,
refunds), (2) keep evidence attached (docs, delivery, checkin/out), and
(3) respect our fairuse DM credits, Safe Mode, and offplatform payment
guardrails.

A\) Principles

Do work in the thread --- Quotes, schedule changes, docs, delivery,
adjustments, refunds are all firstclass actions.

Context everywhere --- Each thread shows role/space, booking status, and
key policy snippets.

Evidence over opinion --- Autoattach Smart Docs, Delivery manifests,
checkin/out, and price math.

Safe by default --- Hide personal contact info; scan attachments;
offplatform payment attempts are discouraged and throttled.

Low friction --- Replies are free; new conversation credits are the only
scarce resource (per §3.2).

LBGaware --- When Talent + Studio are booked together, keep threads
separate but coordinated, with Group Broadcast when needed.

B\) Thread Types & Routing

Inquiry thread (prebooking) --- starts from profile/search/brief invite.
Uses DM credit on the first out
