 implemented (24h/48h/5day) for claims/adjustments/neutral
review.

KB articles created/updated; links wired from help flows.

Agent console: LBG outcome view, deposit actions, message templates,
IB/visibility sanctions.

L\) Why this is "tiny" but necessary

It reuses §3.9 structure---just adds Studiospecific buttons, timers, and
evidence.

It keeps group bookings easy to explain and adjudicate: two bookings,
one summary.

It ensures deposits don't become support landmines (clear windows,
tools, and receipts).

Section 4 --- Product Architecture & Page Map

Goal: Define a coherent, scalable UX architecture that turns our
marketplace rules into screens and flows. Keep the system roleaware
(people vs places), cityaware, SafeModebydefault, and storagesane. Bake
in trust (verification ladder, reputation), fairness (no paytowin
ranking), and booking clarity (escrow, Smart Docs, Delivery Room).\
Studios launch as space listings (not roles): a subhub + AttachinFlow
(brief/checkout), with separate bookings and policies, tied by Linked
Booking Group when purchased with talent.

A\) What Section 4 guarantees (scope & outcomes)

Every jobtobedone has a page & path. Search, profile/listing, booking,
delivery, review, dispute---no "dead ends."

One account, many offerings. A user can operate multiple Service
Profiles (Model/Photographer/Videographer/Creator/FanSubscription
Creator) and optional Studio listings.

Clear separation of entity types. People (roles) vs Places (studios)
remain distinct in search, reviews, policies, and payouts.

Mobilefirst, desktopstrong. A tight 5icon mobile nav; desktop topbar +
action shortcuts; both share the same mental model.

Performance, safety, and accessibility are global requirements, not
afterthoughts.

B\) Core entities (objects the UX revolves around)

Account --- one login; owns assets and settings.

Service Profile (Role) --- personbased offering: Model / Photographer /
Videographer / Creator / FanSubscription Creator.

Studio Listing (Space) --- placebased offering; can earn Verified Studio
(Lite).

Search Query --- role selector + filters; saved search + alert cadence.

Board --- buyer's collection of candidates (talent and studios) with
statuses.

Brief / RFP --- buyer's scope; generates invites/broadcasts.

Booking --- Talent or Studio booking; each has escrow, policy, timeline,
documents.

Linked Booking Group (LBG) --- bundle of a Talent booking + Studio
booking in one checkout; independent rules, synchronized time.

Thread --- messaging with attachments, quotes, docs, decisions.

Smart Docs --- SOW/License/Release/Property & House Rules; esign;
autoamend.

Delivery --- Delivery Room manifest, previews/proxies, external links,
acceptance window.

Verification --- ID, Background (Trusted Pro), SocialVerified, Studio
Lite; badge ladder.

Reputation --- 0--100 score per role; separate space reputation for
studios.

Promotion --- optional paid boosts/featured (guardrailed).

Support Case --- refund/dispute/safety workflow with evidence packs.

C\) Crosscutting UX principles (apply everywhere)

Safe Mode default ON: gates 18+ people roles & feed; studios are never
18+ gated (content must remain SFW).

Roleaware everywhere: Search, cards, reviews, analytics all show the
relevant role/space context.

AttachinFlow: When a shoot brief has a time & city, suggest compatible
studios before checkout.

Evidencefirst resolution: manifests/checkin/out/autochecks \> rhetoric.

Storagesane: previews on platform; originals via
Drive/Dropbox/OneDrive/S3 links (captured as a manifest).

Accessibility (AA) & performance budgets: keyboardable filters, strong
contrast, TTI \< 2.5s on 3G Fast, route codesplitting.

Cityaware: location chips, city selector, and saved searches all obey
the current city context.

D\) Global flows (from first visit to review)

Discover → Home/Category/Case Studies → Search (role selector + filters)
→ Profile/Listing card → Message or Instant Book.

Plan → Brief (Quick/Full) → smart in
