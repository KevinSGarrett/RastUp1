plementation Notes:\
• Keep this appendix version‑controlled; link to the controlling owner
and next review date.\
• Align terminology with Section 1 UI labels and Section 5 metrics
catalog; avoid synonyms that confuse staff.\
• When examples include numbers, ensure they reconcile to Section 3.1
fee math and Section 4.12 receipts.\
• Accessibility: all templates should be usable with keyboard‑only
navigation and screen readers.\
• Privacy: avoid embedding real PII in examples; use placeholders
consistently.\
• City‑gates: where content varies by city, call out the delta
explicitly and tie to the corresponding feature flag.\
• Training: every appendix should have a 1‑page executive summary and a
\'how to use this\' section for Support/Trust.\
• Change control: every material change requires an entry in the
changelog, owner sign‑off, and a Slack announcement to the relevant
channel.

Appendix G --- Experiment Pre‑Registration Template (ties to §5.13)

Generated on 2025-11-04 23:53:44 UTC

Purpose\
Create a repeatable, auditable template for experiments that affect
discovery, pricing, messaging limits, or safety thresholds.
Pre‑registration reduces bias (\'p‑hacking\') and aligns teams on
guardrails and success criteria before launch.

G1. Template Fields

• \*\*Title & ID\*\* --- Experiment name and tracking ID.

• \*\*Owner & Reviewers\*\* --- Product, Data, Trust, Finance sign‑offs.

• \*\*Hypothesis\*\* --- Falsifiable statement including target segment
and expected direction of effect.

• \*\*Primary Metrics\*\* --- Exactly one or two (e.g., S→I, I→B,
dispute loss rate). Defined in §5 catalog.

• \*\*Guardrail Metrics\*\* --- Must not degrade (e.g., organic S→I,
buyer hide rate, safety reports, payout latency).

• \*\*Population & Randomization\*\* --- Eligibility, stratification
(city/role), unit of assignment, holdout size.

• \*\*Sample Size & Power\*\* --- Pre‑computed; expected duration with
traffic estimates.

• \*\*Treatments\*\* --- What changes and what remains constant;
screenshots/copy.

• \*\*Instrumentation\*\* --- Events, experiment bucketing, attribution
windows.

• \*\*Analysis Plan\*\* --- Statistical tests, treatment of outliers,
sequential monitor
