H\) Buyer/Brand Reputation (visible to providers)

Buyer Rep (0--100) components:

Payments & approvals: escrow timely, acceptance within window.

Reliability: ontime arrival/start, cancellation/noshow rate.

Respect & Safety: subrating from providers; safety flags (sealed).

Dispute rate & outcomes.

Display to providers: Buyer Rep ring, recent labels ("Pays on time",
"Clear briefs"), and counts (repeat rate).

Gates: RFP Broadcast requires IDVerified; poor Buyer Rep can trigger
manual review on broadcasts.

I\) How Reviews & Rep affect ranking & access (guardrails)

Search ranking order: relevance → availability → distance → price fit →
Rep tiebreak → minor nudges (Verified/Trusted/Studio).

Boost eligibility (per §3.3): Rep ≥75 and IDVerified; safety flags
disable paid delivery.

Instant Book gating: Rep \<70 or recent strike → IB disabled until 30
clean days or after remediation.

Visibility throttles: Repeated disputes/late cancels lower impression
share temporarily (gradual recovery with clean activity).

J\) Notifications & UX copy (snippets)

"Review ready": "Your project with {Name} is complete---share how it
went (2 minutes). Your feedback publishes after both sides submit or in
7 days."

"Keep it respectful": "Reviews should be factual and professional. We
remove harassment, doxxing, or explicit content."

"Appeal received": "Thanks. Our team will review and respond within 5
business days. We may request evidence."

"Streak earned": "OnTime Streak unlocked: +10 DM credits and a profile
badge visible in search."

K\) KPIs & targets (first 90 days / city)

Review completion rate: ≥70% (bothsided) within 7 days.

Median time to first review: ≤24h postcompletion.

Toxicity rate: ≤0.5% of reviews flagged; confirmed violations ≤0.2%.

Disputeadjusted bias: rating drift after disputes ≤0.3★ (fairness).

Correlation to outcomes: Rep Score topquartile → ≥20% higher
inquiry→booking vs baseline.

Appeals SLA: ≤5 business days average resolution.

Noshow reduction: repeat noshows drop ≥30% after streak/strike logic.

L\) Acceptance criteria (mark 3.7 FINAL)

Doubleblind reviews with 7day window, simultaneous publish, and
disputeaware delay.

Rolespecific subratings live; attachments limited to previews/proxies;
private feedback channel.

Profile displays: overall & histogram, recent highlights, badges,
last90day ops stats, verified references.

Reputation Score computed per role with Bayesian/Wilson, recency
weighting, decay, and antigaming caps.

Buyer Rep visible to providers with components above; broadcast gates
enforced.

Incentives (streaks, fast responder, verification rewards) wired;
neutral reviewcompletion credits.

Moderation & appeals tooling: filters, evidence requests,
redaction/removal, public reply, SLAs.

Ranking integration and feature gates (Boost eligibility, Instant Book
thresholds, impression throttles).

Analytics & alerts for completion rate, toxicity, fairness, anomaly/ring
detection.

M\) Why this works

Trust you can see: Reviews are verified by bookings; objective ops stats
back up the story.

Fair to new users: Bayesian/Wilson and recency avoid "coldstart"
penalties and onereview whiplash.

Behavior improves: Streaks and small nudges reward what
matters---ontime, respectful, responsive, within scope.

Hard to game: Doubleblind, anomaly detection, and evidenceweighted
scoring blunt collusion and retaliation.

Brandsafe: Clear policy lines, 18+ gating for sensitive roles, and fast
moderation keep content and tone professional.

§3.8 --- Growth Loops & Retention

Goal: Turn first actions into habits and habits into repeat bookings.
Build crossside loops (buyers ↔ sellers), selfreinforcing trust loops
(verification → bookings → reviews → ranking), and content loops (feeds,
boards, case studies) --- without paywalls and without harming fairness.

A\) Principles

Value → habit: Every loop must deliver immediate value (leads, clarity,
or time saved) within a user's first 7--14 days.

Crossside by design: F
