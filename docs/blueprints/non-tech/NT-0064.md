§3.7 --- Reviews, Reputation & Incentives

Goal: Capture highsignal, lowfriction feedback after every booking; turn
reliability and respect into visible trust; reward great behavior with
small but meaningful advantages---without creating paytowin or review
gaming.

A\) Principles

Only from verified interactions. Reviews and references originate only
from completed onplatform bookings (or marked "Completed --
TFP/Collab").

Doubleblind & timeboxed. Both sides review; neither sees the other's
until both submit or the window closes.

Roleaware & fair. Reviews are per role
(Model/Photographer/Videographer/Creator/FanSubscription Creator);
search/rank use rolespecific scores.

Evidence over rhetoric. Objective signals (attendance, deliverable
manifests, timing) carry more weight than freetext opinions.

Positive incentives, not paywalls. Rewards for reliability and
verification; never for positive sentiment specifically.

B\) When & how reviews happen (flow)

Trigger: When a booking moves to Completed (acceptance or autoaccept),
both parties receive review prompts.

Window: 7 days to submit; if one party submits, the other has 7 days
from that moment; then publish simultaneously.

Noshow / cancelled: If a side is deemed NoShow or Provider/Buyer Cancel
-- Late, the counterpart may leave a review; flagged with an Event label
(e.g., "Noshow").

TFP/Collab: Reviews allowed; labeled "Collab (no cash)".

Dispute coordination: If a dispute is open, the system delays
publication until resolution; reviews then publish with a Resolved
badge.

C\) Review structure (roleaware rubric)

Star rating (overall): 1--5 stars (halfstars allowed).\
Subratings (1--5, shown on profiles; weight into Reputation Score):

For Providers (e.g., Photographers/Videographers/Creators/Models as
hired talent)

Professionalism & Respect (onset conduct; comfort boundaries honored).

Communication (pre/during/post).

Reliability (ontime, prepared; aligns with checkin/checkout).

Quality vs Scope (deliverables matched the agreed brief/manifest).

Safety & Comfort (Models/Creators) (for bookings with talent; chaperone,
privacy).

For Buyers/Brands (visible to providers)

Clarity of Brief (scope, references, decisions).

Communication.

Reliability & Timeliness (arrived, stayed on schedule).

Respect & Safety (professional set, boundaries honored).

Payments & Approvals (escrow, acceptance, change orders handled
promptly).

Attachments (optional, storagesane):

Up to 3 preview images or short proxy clips (for context), or link to
public proof URL (e.g., verified promo post).

All attachments follow the artisticonly policy; no explicit content.

Private feedback to platform (not public): single freetext box for
safety/moderation signals.

D\) What displays on profiles & search cards

Overall role rating (e.g., 4.8) + rating histogram + \# of verified
reviews.

Recent highlights (last three reviews, 2line excerpts).

Badges & signals: ID Verified, Trusted Pro, Studio Verified,
SocialVerified, FanSubscription Creator (18+ gated).

Operational stats (last 90 days):

Ontime rate (arrived/start on time), Completion rate (jobs finished),
Dispute rate, Response time (median).

Verified references counter: number of completed onplatform
collaborations.

For buyers: a Buyer Rep panel is shown to providers (see §H).

Search cards include: Rep Score ring, average rating, count, last90day
ontime %, and badges.

E\) Reputation Score (0--100) --- computation & decay (refined)

Purpose: A quick, explainable trust signal; used in rankin
