sed on fill,
provider ROAS, and buyer CTR/conv.

Featured pricing review: quarterly by impressions delivered, CTR,
bookings/slot.

L\) What we won't do (explicit guardrails)

No boosting of proposals/RFP response order or message thread
prominence.

No "unverified" or lowRep accounts in paid slots.

No unlabeled or disguised ads.

No auction in v1 (simplicity first); we may test a hybrid bid × QS
auction later if/when liquidity warrants.

M\) Acceptance Criteria (mark 3.3 FINAL)

Search Boost (CPC) live with city+role floors, daily budgets, validclick
billing, even pacing.

Featured Carousel live with weekly flat pricing, rotation, impression
guarantees & makegoods.

Eligibility gates enforced (ID, Rep ≥ 75, booking/reference minimums, no
safety flags); query match hard filter; NSFW compliance.

Caps: density (≤1 above fold; ≤2 in top 20), frequency (2/session,
5/day, 4h cooldown), provider impression share ≤ 8%/day.

QualityScore & ordering implemented; fair roundrobin pacing; organic
share guardrail tracked.

Fraud & safety: invalidclick credits, overspend guard, autopause on
misrep/safety.

Reporting: realtime KPIs + holdoutbased incrementality; autocoaching on
low ROAS.

Admin tools: floors, slot caps, guardrails/kill switch, makegood
credits, cohort gating.

Comms: Integrity Pledge published; buyer labeling & controls shipped;
feedback loop live.

N\) Why this works (for launch)

Protects growth: Paid units are sparse, vetted, and relevancebound;
early users see that quality wins without paying.

Aligns incentives: Providers can optin to spend when it pays; we prove
incremental bookings via holdouts, not just clicks.

Avoids known pitfalls: No inbox/proposal boosting (sidesteps "paytowin"
backlash); strict caps prevent ad overload.

Scales responsibly: Pilot → prove → expand. If metrics or sentiment sag,
kill switch lets us pull back instantly.

SubSection 3.4 --- Verification & Compliance Monetization

Goal: Maximize early adoption and bookings while raising trust. Use
automationfirst verification with manualexception only, verify at
milestones (not at signup), and absorb essential costs during launch.
Store attestations (Pass/Fail) rather than raw PII.

A\) Principles (launch posture)

Frictionlight, milestonegated. No heavy checks at signup. We trigger
verification only when it unlocks value or reduces risk (e.g., Instant
Book, first payout, privateaddress shoots).

Automation first, humans last. Use vendor SDKs (doc scan, liveness,
geocode) and OCR to autoapprove the vast majority; route only fails/edge
cases to a small ops queue.

Platform absorbs essential costs (launch). Treat ID checks as customer
acquisition and trust investment; revisit after liquidity.

Privacy by design. We keep outcome + timestamp + vendor; vendors hold
sensitive artifacts.

Explainable & fair. Clear consent, reasons, appeals. No protectedclass
logic.

Citylevel dials. Subsidy, triggers, and badge rules configurable per
launch city.

B\) The Verification Ladder (what, when, why)

Tier 0 --- Account Basics (always free)

Email + phone (SMS) verify, device fingerprint, IP risk screen.

Badge: New --- building trust. Limited DM credits (see §3.2).

Tier 1 --- ID Verification (unlocks value; platformpaid at launch)

Triggers (any of): enable Instant Book; accept first paid booking;
release first payout; host at a private address (nonstudio); exceed
monthly newconversation cap.

Method: gov ID scan + selfie liveness + fraud checks (SDK).

Unlocks: ID Verified badge, Instant Book, +20 DM credits, minor search
tiebreak (equal matches).

Refresh: every 24 months or on risk events.

Tier 2 --- Background Check ("Trusted Pro", optional; passthrough
priced)

Triggers: optin for Trusted Pro badge; required for certain sensitive
categories if ever added.

Method: SSN trace, national criminal/sexoffender, sanctions; countylevel
where indicated by vendor logic.

Unlocks: Trusted Pro badge, provider fee --0.5% (see §3.1), RFP
priority, onetime \$15 Boost cou
