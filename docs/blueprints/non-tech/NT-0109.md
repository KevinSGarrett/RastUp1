engine returns jurisdiction breakdown (state/county/city) and total tax.

If the transaction is not taxable in that jurisdiction or we're below
nexus in that state, tax shows \$0.00 with "Not applicable" tooltip.

If taxable, tax appears as a separate line with "View tax detail"
(expandable).

holds listed for Studio (authorization only).
