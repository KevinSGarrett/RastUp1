3 nearby matches with "creative amenities" chips; increases award rate
by reducing buyer friction.

Talent crosssell: photographers who own a studio can toggle Studio AddOn
(hourly) inside their package; the system then exposes that studio at
checkout.

Boards: saved boards can include both talent & studios; Compare view
keeps them separated by type.

G\) Supply Seeding Playbook (first 30--60 days)

Curate 15--30 creative studios (natural light lofts, cyclorama spaces,
warehouse sets) in the founding city.

Fasttrack verification (Lite); waive Studio Lite fee for first 25.

Founding Host perks: Featured placement in Verified Studios (Lite)
carousel for 60 days; 0% buyer fee on first booking to stimulate demand.

Quality bar: professional photos required; template rules; minimum
availability posting (2+ days/week).

Partnerships: local studio associations, photo schools, production
collectives.

H\) Demand GTM Hooks

Bundle messaging: "Book the crew and the space in one place."

Saved Searches: "Talent + Studio in \[City\] this weekend" templates.

Case studies: showcase shoots that used both a Verified Studio and
onplatform talent; highlight time saved.

I\) IA & Nav Guidance (affects §4.0/§4.1 rewrites)

Browse ▸ Verified Studios (Lite) under Browse (not topnav).

Attach a Studio step in Brief/Checkout (primary place most buyers will
encounter studios).

Studio result cards use a distinct badge & amenity chips; but share card
patterns with talent for consistency.

J\) KPIs & KillSwitches (90day postlaunch)

Attachrate: ≥ 20% of shoot briefs add a studio candidate.

Studioinvolved GMV: ≥ 15% of GMV involves a studio by month 3.

Fill rate: ≥ 50% of hosted studio slots receive at least one
inquiry/week.

Incident rate: damage disputes \< 1% of studio bookings.

Killswitch: If attachrate \< 8% and studio search CTR \< 2% for 8
consecutive weeks, hide Studios from Browse and keep only Attach in
Brief/Checkout; revisit supply fit.

K\) Acceptance Criteria (mark Addendum A FINAL)

Attach a Studio step live in Brief and Checkout, prefiltered by
city/date.

Verified Studios (Lite) subhub live under Browse (grid + map); creative
amenity filters.

Studio booking: hourly + min hours, instant book default (host can
require approval), overtime rules, cleaning fee field, rules & access
surfaced prepay.

Deposits: card hold configurable per listing; damage claim flow with 24h
window.

Policies: studio cancel matrix implemented; host cancel strike/IB pause
wired.

Verification Lite flow for studios connected; property/space release
autoattached via Smart Docs.

Crosssell: studio chips on talent profiles when owned/linked; Studio
AddOn in photographer packages.

KPIs dashboards for attachrate, studio GMV share, incident rate;
killswitch automation.

L\) Why this works

Amplifies, doesn't distract: Studios boost conversion of shoots without
turning us into a venue marketplace.

Curated & creativeonly: We avoid the event/party longtail and focus on
spaces that matter to our users.

Operationally sane: Lite verification, instant book defaults, deposits,
and simple amenity filters keep v1 lean.

Option value: If traction pops, we can elevate Studios in the nav and
expand supply; if not, we gracefully tuck it behind "Attach" without
harming core flows.

SubSection 3.1 --- Core Monetization Mechanics

Goal: Monetize in ways that increase trust and throughput, not friction.
Keep pricing simple, fair, and transparent; reward the behaviors that
grow the marketplace (verification, Instant Book, reliability).

A\) What we charge (and why)

1\) Transaction (perbooking) economics

Provider fee (commission): 12% of booking subtotal (packages + extras +
license + travel).\
Why: This benchmarks lower than creator marketplaces like Collabstr
(15%), Swipecast (15%), and Peerspace host fees (15--20%), while
remaining close to Upwork's freelancer fee (10%)---so we're competitive
for launch without undercutting our margins.

Buyer service fee: 5% (min \$3);
