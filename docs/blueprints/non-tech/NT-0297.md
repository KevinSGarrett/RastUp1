 are transferred via external storage (Drive/Dropbox)
with immutable manifests.\
Payments flow through card (3DS where required) and ACH (with a
buyer‑fee discount); funds are escrowed and released on acceptance.\
Instant Book is gated by ID verification; background checks are opt‑in
(Trusted Pro). Feature flags and city gates are used for reversible,
auditable launches.\
Admin consoles enable Support, Trust & Safety, Finance, and Ops to
perform routine tasks without code changes.

Goals:\
• Deliver equitable access to the platform and prohibit discrimination
by users in listings and bookings.\
• Commit to WCAG 2.1 AA and continuous accessibility improvement.\
• Protect users from harassment and discriminatory conduct in content
and messages.

Scope & Applicability:\
Applies to all product surfaces, content, and user interactions.
Providers and buyers must comply with non‑discrimination rules in their
offers and conduct.

Definitions (plain language):\
• Accessibility: making content usable by people with disabilities,
including visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive.\
• Discrimination: unfavorable treatment based on protected classes
(e.g., race, gender, disability, religion, sexual orientation).\
• Accommodation: reasonable modifications to policies and practices
where appropriate.

Policy Statements:\
• WCAG commitment: design system patterns aim for 2.1 AA; audits
scheduled; defects tracked like product bugs.\
• Non‑discrimination: providers may define genre/skill/availability
criteria but may not refuse work based on protected classes.\
• Harassment policy: aligned with §8.2; zero tolerance for slurs,
targeting, or exclusionary conduct.\
• Accommodation: support channels for accessibility needs; studio house
rules must include accessible entry info where applicable.

Procedures & Operational Playbooks:\
• Accessibility QA: keyboard nav tests, contrast checks, screen reader
flows; bug triage and regression tests.\
• Enforcement: report intake for discrimination; evidence review;
proportionate actions; education first where misunderstanding is likely.

Enforcement & Remedies:\
• Outcomes: warning, content removal, booking cancellation support, or
account limits; repeat violations escalate.\
• Appeals: allow users to contest decisions; moderators consider context
and cultural sensitivity.

Data, Privacy & Retention:\
• Data: avoid collecting protected class data unless required for law;
do not use protected attributes in ranking or promotions.\
• Privacy: accommodation requests handled discreetly; limited
visibility; retention minimal.

Templates & Required Notices (internal/external):\
• Templates: accessibility statement; discrimination policy; report
forms; accommodation request flows; guidance for studio accessibility
disclosure.\
• Training: inclusive language for support; accessible design patterns
for product and marketing.

Compliance Metrics & Audits:\
• Accessibility defect rate; time to fix high‑severity accessibility
bugs; discrimination report outcomes; user satisfaction among
screen‑reader users.

Risks & Mitigations:\
• Token compliance without usability → test with real users; uneven
enforcement → publish examples and decisions to reduce ambiguity.

Acceptance Checklist (ready to externalize):\
□ Statement published; audits scheduled; design system updated; training
completed; report flows live.

Deep Dive: Scenario --- Unsafe off‑platform interaction: intake,
escalation, and law‑enforcement coordination.\
We capture intake checklists, decision trees, and user messaging; list
admin actions; define audit fields; and annotate guardrails. We avoid
legal conclusions in user‑facing copy and defer to counsel where
necessary, while keeping product/ops steps executable.
