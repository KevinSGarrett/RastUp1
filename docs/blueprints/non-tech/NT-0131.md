L\) Why this works

Automates the heavy lifting (forms, calcs, filings) while keeping humans
in the loop where judgment matters.

Prevents surprises with nexus monitoring, exception queues, and dual
approvals on exposurechanging edits.

Auditable & defensible: signed forms, efile IDs, mapping changes, and
filing confirmations are all in one place.

§4.14.8 --- Promotions & Marketplace Economics

Goal: Give Ops/Marketing a nocode control tower for paid visibility that
drives incremental bookings without corrupting relevance: configure CPC
floors and Featured pricing citybycity, tune Quality Score (QS) weights,
enforce density/frequency caps, manage eligibility/safety, run
experiments, and measure true incrementality (ROAS)---all with
guardrails, audits, and rollbacks.

A\) Scope, Roles & Guardrails

Who uses this: Ops (city/market), Marketing, Finance (billing/credits),
Trust & Safety (eligibility), Readonly Auditor.\
What it controls: Search Boost (CPC), Featured Carousels (weekly flat),
eligibility gates, QS weighting, density/frequency caps, citytier CPC
floors, delivery guarantees & makegoods, experiments, fraud controls,
wallet credits.\
Guardrails: "Never paytowin"---paid units must match query/filters; caps
enforced (≤2/20; ≤1 above fold); Promoted label shown; safety
eligibility in effect (ID Verified + Rep ≥ 70 + no recent strikes).

B\) Inventory Model (what can be sold)

Search Results Boost (CPC)

Placement: inline search cards; ribbons autogenerated ("Instant Book",
"Trusted Pro", "Available this week").

Capacity controls: density cap per page and frequency caps per buyer
(config in §4.14.2).

Charging: per valid click (invalid click credits autoapply to wallet).

Featured Carousels (Weekly Flat)

Placement: Home + category landing ("Featured in Houston"; "Featured
Photographers").

Slots: 10--16 per carousel; rotational pacing with impression guarantees
& makegood logic.

Creative rules: No custom creatives. We render the standard profile
card + approved ribbon variants only (prevents deception and review
load).

C\) City Tiers & Pricing Governance

City tiers: A (e.g., HOU/DAL/LA/NYC/ATL), B (growth metros), C
(smaller).

CPC floors per city×role (e.g., HOU:model = \$0.90) and weekly Featured
prices per city×role (e.g., \$69/wk).

Scheduling: price changes can be scheduled (start/end) with local
timezone; staged rollouts.

Review cadence: monthly CPC floor review (±\$0.10--0.20) based on fill
rate, CPB, ROAS; quarterly Featured pricing review (impression delivery
& bookings/slot).

Dual approval: any CPC floor increase ≥ \$0.20 in 24h, or Featured price
change ≥ 20% requires twoperson approval (per §4.14.1).

Keys live in §4.14.2: promos.boosts.cpc_floor.city_role,
promos.featured.weekly_price.city_role.

D\) Eligibility, Targeting & Safety

Eligibility rule (configurable DSL): default id_verified && rep\>=70 &&
!recent_strike.

NSFW/Safe Mode: paid units respect city NSFW visibility and Safe Mode
thresholds (from §4.14.2).

Targeting knobs: city, radius, role; negative keywords (provider can
exclude).

Autosuppression: any active Safety investigation or miscategorized
profile → campaign paused until cleared.

E\) Ranking Inside Paid Caps (fair ordering)

Within paid slots only:

Quality Score (0--1) components (weights tunable in §4.14.2):

Exact filter match fit (role/location/price/availability)

Responsiveness (firstresponse time & rate)

Rep Score

Instant Book enabled

Price fit to query median

Historical CTR (timedecayed)

Paid Order Score: score = log(bid) \* α + QS \* (1−α) (default α=0.5;
guardrails 0.3--0.7).

Tiebreak: lower effective CPC (bid ÷ QS) wins to reward relevance.

Keys: promos.boosts.qs_weight_bid, promos.boosts.qs_weight_quality.
