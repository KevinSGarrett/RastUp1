t logs.\
• Signature templates, API, webhook receipts, long‑term storage, and
hash verification.

Integration scopes & surfaces (what we build):\
• IDV modal, consent screens, retry flows; badges; \'verified‑only\'
search filter.\
• BG consent; status messaging; Trusted Pro badge; reputation
integration.\
• E‑signature templates (SOW, releases), per‑booking envelopes; receipts
linkback.

Commercial & legal patterns (illustrative):\
• Per‑check pricing with volume tiers; subsidies for founding city;
credits on false positives.\
• E‑signature per‑envelope or monthly pool; usage alerts.

Enablement & co‑marketing (how we launch together):\
• Help‑center copy; sample SOW/release library; appeals instructions;
adverse action templates.\
• Macros for edge cases (name mismatches; re‑verification; BG disputes).

Top risks & mitigations:\
• False declines; user frustration; FCRA errors; cost overrun from high
retry rates.

Operational playbooks (summary):\
• Switch to lighter IDV threshold for non‑Instant Book use; maintain
stricter bar for IB.\
• Pause BG adjudication if legal notices misconfigured; fix templates;
resume.

Owners & RACI:\
• Trust lead, Legal, Product (Trust), Support, Data.

KPIs & leading indicators:\
• IDV completion; IB adoption; BG pass rate; adverse action timing
adherence; dispute rate changes.

Acceptance criteria (ready / successful when):\
✓ IDV and BG flows pass QA; legal templates reviewed; badges gated;
audit logs live; appeals working.

Timeline & checkpoints:\
• IDV in Beta; BG rollout optional post‑beta; e‑signature in GA.

Scenario Playbook --- IDV false‑positive cluster:\
Trigger: Completion drops; reports by specific device/OS\
Response: Vendor escalation; adjust thresholds; publish guidance; extend
retries.\
Legal/Comms: UI hints; support macro; status page if widespread.\
Roll‑back/Forward: Revert threshold; schedule root‑cause review.\
Owner: Trust/Product \| Telemetry: idv_completion, retry_rate \|
Evidence: Vendor logs, device/OS breakdown

Implementation Notes:\
• Partner Governance: Maintain a single source of truth for partner
status (prospect, NDA, pilot, GA), contacts, contracts, scopes, and
SLAs. Tag all features behind partner flags and city gates to avoid
blast‑radius mistakes. • Privacy & Data: Apply least‑data
principles---only request scopes needed for the user value; rotate
tokens; revoke access on inactivity. • Security & Audits: Vendor
SOC/pentest reports stored with expiry reminders; incident bridges
pre‑arranged for Sev‑1/Sev‑0. • Co‑Marketing Discipline: Announce after
pilots prove value; enforce clear success metrics; align PR/brand tone
with our artistic‑only policy. • Support & Playbooks: Create
partner‑specific macros; train Support/Trust on integration quirks; log
incidents with partner tags. • Measurement: Attribute partner impact in
§5 dashboards (e.g., ACH share by vendor, IDV completion rate by
provider, studio attach from verified partners). • Contracts: Avoid
exclusivity unless compensated; require termination rights, data
return/delete clauses, and uptime credits for SLA misses. • City
Sequencing: Some partners launch in founding cities only; we gate by
city to manage operational readiness. • Accessibility & Inclusion:
Ensure partner widgets meet WCAG 2.1 AA; provide text alternatives and
keyboard navigation.\
• Ethics & Brand Safety: Decline partners whose practices conflict with
user safety or our policy posture; include an ethics review in intake.
