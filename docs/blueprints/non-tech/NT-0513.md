ness. • Accessibility & Inclusion:
Ensure partner widgets meet WCAG 2.1 AA; provide text alternatives and
keyboard navigation.\
• Ethics & Brand Safety: Decline partners whose practices conflict with
user safety or our policy posture; include an ethics review in intake.

Implementation Notes:\
• Partner Governance: Maintain a single source of truth for partner
status (prospect, NDA, pilot, GA), contacts, contracts, scopes, and
SLAs. Tag all features behind partner flags and city gates to avoid
blast‑radius mistakes. • Privacy & Data: Apply least‑data
principles---only request scopes needed for the user value; rotate
tokens; revoke access on inactivity. • Security & Audits: Vendor
SOC/pentest reports stored with expiry reminders; incident bridges
pre‑arranged for Sev‑1/Sev‑0. • Co‑Marketing Discipline: Announce after
pilots prove value; enforce clear success metrics; align PR/brand tone
with our artistic‑only policy. • Support & Playbooks: Create
partner‑specific macros; train Support/Trust on integration quirks; log
incidents with partner tags. • Measurement: Attribute partner impact in
§5 dashboards (e.g., ACH share by vendor, IDV completion rate by
provider, studio attach from verified partners). • Contracts: Avoid
exclusivity unless compensated; require termination rights, data
return/delete clauses, and uptime credits for SLA misses. • City
Sequencing: Some partners launch in founding cities only; we gate by
city to manage operational readiness. • Accessibility & Inclusion:
Ensure partner widgets meet WCAG 2.1 AA; provide text alternatives and
keyboard navigation.\
• Ethics & Brand Safety: Decline partners whose practices conflict with
user safety or our policy posture; include an ethics review in intake.

Partnerships Disclaimer: This is an internal planning document for
partner strategy and ecosystem development. It does not create
commitments. All integrations ship behind flags, follow privacy
policies, and require vendor due diligence, DPAs, SLAs, and legal
review. Commercial terms are illustrative until negotiated.

Context & Alignment: US‑only marketplace at launch; subscription‑free;
monetization via take‑rate and capped, eligibility‑gated usage‑based
promotions. Public content is artistic‑only with Safe‑Mode on for
guests. Deliverables flow via external links (Drive/Dropbox) with
immutable manifests; escrow releases on acceptance. Instant Book is
gated by ID verification; background checks are opt‑in (Trusted Pro).
Rollouts are city‑gated behind feature flags; Admin Console enforces
least‑privilege, JIT elevation, two‑person approvals, immutable audits,
and kill‑switches.

Goals:\
• Increase Instant Book eligibility safely with high IDV completion and
optional BG checks; reduce dispute and safety incidents.\
• Enable compliant e‑signature for SOW/releases without leaving the
platform.

Target partner segments:\
• IDV providers (document + selfie checks); BG providers with FCRA
workflows; e‑signature vendors with embedded flows.

Mutual value proposition:\
• Trust lift → higher conversion; fewer impersonation scams; easier
dispute resolution with verified identity.\
• Seamless SOW/releases reduce friction and create better evidence for
chargebacks.

Selection criteria & due diligence:\
• Accuracy/latency; liveness detection; edge case coverage (lighting,
IDs); re‑verification options.\
• FCRA compliance (pre‑adverse/adverse notices); adjudication portal;
dispute handling; audit logs.\
• Signature templates, API, webhook receipts, long‑term storage, and
hash verification.

Integration scopes & surfaces (what we build):\
• IDV modal, consent screens, retry flows; badges; \'verified‑only\'
search filter.\
• BG consent; status messaging; Trusted Pro badge; reputation
integration.\
• E‑signature templates (SOW, releases), per‑booking envelopes; receipts
linkback.
