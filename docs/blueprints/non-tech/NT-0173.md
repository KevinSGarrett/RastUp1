M\) Why this works

Least data, most value: We keep only what we need, as long as we need
it, where it's safest.

Operationally practical: Unmask flows are rare, justified, timeboxed,
and audited---yet Support/Tax can do their work.

Auditable & defensible: Clear ledgers, purge logs, and DLP alarms prove
compliance in audits and incidents.

Futureproof: USfirst, but patterns (vault, tiers, retention) scale to
stricter regimes if we expand later.
