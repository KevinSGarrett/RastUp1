get & Dates: extend end dates, add makegood credits.

Bulk credit for invalid clicks during incident (ties into §4.14.8
wallet).

Guardrails: eligibility enforced; Finance ledger posts; notify affected
users (template).

G\) Search/Index & Social --- Reindex, Recalc, Resync

Use cases: new facet weights; rep formula tweak; social API outage
recovery.

Actions:

Reindex profiles/search with new §4.14.2 weights or facet toggles;
chunked by city.

Rep Recalc: recompute scores for selected cohorts (e.g., HOU
photographers); publish atomically.

Social Resync: refresh IG/TT/YT/X metrics for affected accounts
(ratelimited; respect API quotas); mark verified/unverified chips
accordingly.

NSFW Rescan: rerun classifier on portfolio thumbnails when threshold
changes; rewrite preview crops.

Guardrails: throttle; backoff on provider API limits; banner "metrics
refreshing" on profiles.

H\) Boards & Content --- Move, Retag, Reassign

Use cases: consolidate user's boards, fix mistagged collaborators after
merge, remove content from feeds.

Actions:

Move items between boards; rename/merge boards; preserve creation dates.

Retag collaborators on content to new canonical user (after merge); send
consent prompt again if needed.

Remove or reprivacy content in policy migrations (e.g., stricter preview
rules) with reason + appeal link.

Guardrails: respect collaborator consent states; moderation rules
(§4.14.4) rerun on moved items.

I\) Studios --- Policy Parameter Updates

Use cases: city raises default deposits; cleaning fee minima update; min
duration changes.

Actions:

Deposit %/cap updates to listings; choose: apply to new bookings only or
also to open (future) bookings via addendum + reaccept.

Cleaning fee minima mass set; min duration increased; starttime
increment adjusted.

Visibility tier: demote unverified studios from carousels.

Guardrails: LBGaware; generate addenda; Finance deposit holds adjusted
only on new checkouts (never silently increased on existing bookings).

J\) Previews, Simulation & Impact Checks

For every job:

Count & sample (before/after columns).

Impact tiles: total refunds \$, \# bookings affected, \# users to
notify, campaigns paused, index rebuild time estimate.

Dependency warnings: "10 bookings have open disputes", "5 users under
safety investigation", "25 payouts queued".

KPI simulation (when applicable): expected takerate delta, ROAS effect
range, search ranking drift.

K\) Scheduling, Chunking & Idempotency

Chunk size defaults (e.g., 500 users; 2,000 bookings; 10,000 index
docs).

Pacing: interbatch delay (e.g., 2--10s), offpeak windows (cityaware).

Idempotency: each batch writes a job_id + batch_id footprint; retries
skip alreadydone rows.

Resume: pick up from last successful batch; Stop is safe; Requeue failed
only.

Rate limits: external API calls (social, PSP) throttled; exponential
backoff.

L\) Communications (optional but recommended)

Attach email/SMS templates (§4.14.10) per job type (refund notice,
policy addendum, campaign pause, merge confirm).

Quiet hours respected; city timezone aware.

"Why you're seeing this" copy autofilled with reason code and policy
link.

M\) Data Integrity & Audit

Snapshot prechange: affected rows (IDs, key fields) hashed and archived.

Immutable job log: inputs, approvals, batches, outcomes, error list.

Entity timelines updated (e.g., "Bulk refund JOB123 applied 20251104").

Downloadables: CSV of results (masked), error CSV, notification list.

N\) Metrics & Alerts

KPIs

Job success %; average retry rate; rollback rate; time to completion.

Money jobs: total \$ moved, variance vs preview (target \< 1%).

Index jobs: doc rebuild throughput, search latency impact.

Comms: open/click/complaint rate on notices.

Safety: user reports spike postjob (guardrail metric).

Alerts

Batch error rate \> threshold; preview vs actual deltas; money cap
nearing; API ratelimit stalls; search p95 \> SLA during reindex.

O\) Telemetry (Bulk Ops)
