eply; request a Community reference link (offplatform
collaborator may submit; owner approves).

Analytics (per role)

Profile views, search appearances, top queries that matched you,
conversion funnel (view → message → booking), pricefit vs city median,
responsetime impact, social growth (if connected), Rep score breakdown.

Verification nudges

Inline cards: "Verify ID to unlock Instant Book", "Pass Background to
earn Trusted Pro", "Connect socials to show metrics".

Link a Studio

If account owns a studio listing: link/unlink; Studio AddOn toggle for
packages (hourly + min hours).

F\) Data, Reviews & Reputation (rolescoped)

Reviews & Rep are scoped to the role being viewed; profiles show that
role's score; a mini "Also operates as ..." band links to other roles
with their score badges.

Community references labeled and weighted lower than Verified booking
reviews.

Fraud guards: multiple reviews from same buyer throttle; unusual review
bursts flagged.

G\) Safety, Privacy & Compliance (profile level)

Artisticonly media enforced in uploader; SafeMode previews only in
public/feeds.

No external contact leaks: public profile hides emails/phones; outbound
links limited to verified social icons and case studies.

Chaperone policy visible on Model/Creator profiles; harassment reporting
from the profile.

Minor participation: Phase2 via guardian/agency only; profiles must be
18+ at launch.

Report profile modal covers misrepresentation, unsafe behavior, policy
violations.

H\) MultiRole UX

Public profile shows role tabs (if user operates multiple).

Start on the role that matched the entry (from search).

Tab switch shows rolespecific packages, reviews, rep, and fields; keeps
Message / Book CTAs contextual to the active role.

Header chips persist (Verified, Trusted Pro) per role; socials are
shared.

I\) Performance & Accessibility

Lazyload media; responsive srcset; AVIF/WebP where available; alttext
required.

Tab ARIA roles; keyboardable galleries; captions for videos;
highcontrast compliance.

Skeletons for header & package list; TTI target \<2.5s on 3G Fast.

J\) Telemetry (events)

profile.view (role) • cta.click.book \| cta.click.message • board.add

portfolio.tag.approve/decline • package.book.start/complete •
instant_book.toggle

social.verified_chip.view • rep.why.open • studio.link.click

update.post • follow.click • review.submit/respond

analytics.view (owner) • price_fit.hint.view/action

K\) Acceptance Criteria (mark 4.4 FINAL)

Public role profiles render with Header, Tabs (Portfolio, Packages,
About, Reviews, Updates, Policies), rightrail modules, and sticky
Book/Request on mobile.

appears for linked studios and adds to checkout as LBG.

Social metric chips render only when verified connections exist;
unverified links labeled clearly.

Reviews show verifiedbooking first; community references labeled; owner
can reply once; Rep "Why" panel works.

Updates feed posts publish to profile and follower feeds; Follow count
displays.

Tagging & approvals for portfolio items work; collaborator links open
profiles.

Safe Mode hides FanSubscription Creator role & any beyondLingerie sets
unless OFF; all media remains SFW on public surfaces.

Owner editor provides Portfolio, Packages, About, Availability,
Policies, Updates, Reviews, Analytics, Link a Studio, and Verification
nudges.

Telemetry events fire as listed; performance & accessibility targets
met.

L\) Why this works

Bookable storefronts: Every role's page converts (clear packages,
availability, and CTAs).

Signalrich but simple: Badges, social chips, and a transparent Rep score
reduce risk without clutter.

Multirole clarity: Each role stands on its own merit; switching is
explicit; reviews/reputation never mix.

Network effects: Tagging, case studies, and fo
