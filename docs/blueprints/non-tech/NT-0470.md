m is \'done\' until admin tools enable
Support/Trust/Finance to handle the top 3 edge cases without
engineering.\
• Copy & Policy: All flows have help‑center articles and email/SMS
templates; copy avoids legalese and links to policy examples.\
• QA & Drills: Staging mimics production data shapes; drills include
processor/tax outages, moderation surges, and incident command
handoffs.\
• Experimentation: Features that affect marketplace economics (ranking,
boosts, fees) include holdouts and guardrails; we measure incremental
impact.\
• Data Wiring: Events land in Bronze/Silver/Gold (§5); KPIs pull only
from Gold with freshness SLOs. Definitions live in a metrics catalog.\
• Accessibility: New UI complies with WCAG 2.1 AA; screen‑reader and
keyboard paths verified; contrast ratios checked; defects triaged.\
• Security & Privacy: PII masked by default; JIT elevation for sensitive
admin actions; vendor scopes minimal; audits immutable.\
• City Readiness: City‑first artifacts (press kit, creator ambassadors,
studio partners) prepared in §10.1 runbook.\
• Post‑Launch: 7/30/90‑day reviews convert observations into roadmap
changes; flags let us tune by city without forks.

Roadmap Disclaimer: This is an internal planning document. Dates are
placeholders and will firm up as Section 5 telemetry validates
conversion and quality gates. All items ship behind flags and city
allowlists. Nothing herein creates external commitments.

Context & Alignment: US‑only creative marketplace; subscription‑free at
launch; monetization via take‑rate and usage‑based promotions with
eligibility gates and strict caps; public content limited to
artistic‑only (guest Safe‑Mode on by default); deliverables handled via
external links (Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests; escrowed
payments released on acceptance; Instant Book gated by ID verification;
optional background checks confer Trusted Pro; city‑gated rollout with
feature flags; strong Admin Console with least‑privilege, JIT elevation,
two‑person approvals, and immutable audits.

Timeframe & Scope:\
• T+150 to T+240.

Goals:\
• Replicate Houston GA playbook in Dallas and Austin with measured spend
and PR.\
• Prepare Studios Beta (verification, house rules, deposit defaults) for
a limited cohort.\
• Ensure cross‑city data comparability; maintain flag discipline.

Product Themes:\
• Scale predictably; avoid overextending; test studios with narrow
scope.

Workstreams & Deliverables:\
• City turn‑up runbooks; founding perks; featured carousels; referral
codes via partner studios.\
• Studio verification flow (doc upload + light review); house rules
template library; deposit holds; check‑in/out surfaces.\
• LBG scaffolding (internal): dual‑leg receipts off; group bundling
experiments (behind flags only).

Feature Flags & City Gates:\
• city.DAL allowlist, city.AUS allowlist, feature.studio.beta=false,
feature.lbg.scaffold=true (internal only).

Dependencies & Inputs:\
• City ops staff; studio partner pipeline; legal review of house rules;
deposit capture on processor.

Top Risks & Mitigations:\
• Supply thin pockets; PR backlash; deposit misuse; studio disputes;
throughput on support.

Instrumentation & KPIs:\
• City S→I/I→B; supply coverage heatmaps; studio attach rate; deposit
claims; dispute rate for studio bookings.

Acceptance Criteria (Go/No‑Go):\
✓ Dallas/Austin meet beta→GA gates; studio beta ready checklists green;
deposit flow tested.

Staffing & Ownership:\
• City GMs; Studios PM; Trust; Support; Growth; Finance; SRE.

Milestones & Checkpoints:\
• Dallas GA; Austin GA; Studios Beta go/no‑go; partner case studies.

Implementation Notes:\
• Flag Discipline: Each capability ships behind a named flag with a
runbook, owner, rollback, and blast‑radius notes. Flags default to
\'off\' in new cities.\
• Admin Operability: No workstr
