Outreach tools: import local studio lists; template packs for
invitations (discounted Featured, verification subsidies).

Quality gates: require Studio Verified for carousel placement; deposit
defaults autoapplied.

J\) Compliance & Insurance (lighttouch)

COI upload field (optional/required based on amenity---e.g., aerial
rigs); expiry tracking; reminder 30 days prior.

Local regulations: note fields for special permits (fire, drone,
alcohol); checklist acknowledges compliance.

Underage protections: if minors allowed by House Rules, enforce
chaperone clause and IDverified guardian signature.

K\) Support & Safety Integrations

Access failures autoopen Support case (P1) with House Rules and code
logs attached (§4.14.5).

Unsafe conditions reports route to T&S; delist until fixes verified
(§4.14.3).

Moderation: listing images/text scanned per §4.14.4; explicit sets
blocked; appeals possible.

L\) Metrics & Alerts

KPIs

Verification coverage (# Verified Studios, % of studio supply).

Access failure rate (per 100 bookings), deposit claim rate & win %.

Dispute rate (studio leg) and time to resolve.

Utilization: hours booked / hours available; overtime incidence.

Image quality pass rate at moderation; COI validity %.

Coverage by neighborhood vs target (green/yellow/red).

Alerts

Lockouts \> threshold/day; deposit auths expiring \> threshold; COI
expiring in ≤30 days; neighborhood coverage gaps; repeated unsafe
condition reports.

M\) Telemetry (Studios Ops)

studio.verify.submit/approve/reject/reverify_due

studio.listing.photo.upload/flag/approve

studio.rules.apply/update • studio.deposit.config.update

studio.access.lockout.signal/resolve

studio.deposit.claim.open/capture/void/release

studio.visibility.tier.update • studio.featured.assign

studio.coverage.alert • studio.coi.upload/expire

N\) Acceptance Criteria (mark 4.14.11 FINAL)

Onboarding & verification flow with evidence, GPSstamped photos, House
Rules packs, and badge issuance/reverify cadence.

Amenity taxonomy and blacklist enforced; listing photos moderated for
SFW previews.

Deposits configured per city; holds at checkout; claim flow with
evidence and calculator; captures/voids in Finance.

Access & lockout playbooks with relocation option and goodwill credits
within caps.

Availability/pricing knobs (min duration, increments, overtime, cleaning
fee); visibility tiering and search facets.

LBG support: group checkout, legscoped disputes, group receipt, conflict
wizard.

Compliance fields (COI, permits); reminder system for expiries.

City coverage heatmap & seeding hooks; Featured eligibility integration.

Metrics, alerts, telemetry dashboards live; audit trails for all
actions.

O\) Why this works

Trustable supply (verified, documented, SFW) that plugs directly into
your booking, dispute, and finance rails.

Smooth dayof operations (clear House Rules, access, deposits) cut
Support load and refunds.

City growth ready with coverage targets, seeding tools, and fair
visibility.

Nocode adjustments keep you nimble as you scale studios alongside
talent.

§4.14.12 --- Data & Reporting (Admin UI)

Goal: Give nonengineering teams one place to see how the marketplace is
performing, diagnose issues, and act---without raw SQL. Dashboards are
curated, LBGaware, privacysafe, and tie back to exact definitions in a
shared metric catalog. Exports and alerts are scheduled, and everything
is auditable. (Section 5 will specify the data warehouse schema & event
contracts.)

A\) Scope, Roles & Guardrails

Who uses this: Execs, City Ops, Marketing/Promotions, Trust & Safety,
Content Moderation, Support, Finance/Tax, Studios Ops, Product.\
What it covers: Curated dashboards, drilldowns, cohorting/segmentation,
scheduled reports, anomaly alerts, CSV/JSON exports.\
Guardrails:

RBAC mirrors §4.14.1 (Admin Security).

PII masked by default; unmask requires scope + reason.

LBG vs leg metrics are clearly labeled.

All numbers show definition tooltips linking to the Metric Catalog.
