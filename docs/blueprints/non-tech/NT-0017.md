adjust at checkout when applicable.

Yearend docs: Providers get a yeartodate earnings report and any
required tax forms via the payout provider dashboard.

We avoid giving tax advice; we provide the records and surface
processorlevel reporting where applicable.

L\) Notifications & Calendar

Email/push for: requests, invites, accept/decline, payment received,
reminder (24h/2h before), reschedule, dispute events, payout sent.

Calendar: 2way sync (readonly in MVP; writeback in Phase 2). ICS file in
confirmation email.

M\) Provider & Buyer Dashboards

Provider (per role + overall):

Next bookings; outstanding requests; required actions (confirm, deliver,
message).

Earnings (pending, available, lifetime), payouts history.

Policy & pricing quick edit; Instant Book toggles; Autoaccept rules.

Disputes center: upload evidence, view status.

Buyer:

Upcoming shoots; requests & invites; Reschedule/Cancel; Add extras;
Leave review; Receipts and invoices.

N\) Analytics Touchpoints (tiein to §1.2)

Booking funnel: Profile views → addtocart → request/IB → confirmed →
completed (per role).

Cancellation & dispute rates (per policy, per package).

Revenue by package/extras/license (help providers tune offers).

Time to accept / response time (feeds search filters).

Promo impact: Track fee discounts vs. conversion and LTV.

O\) Acceptance Criteria (for engineering & QA)

Three booking modes fully functional (Instant Book, RequesttoBook, Smart
Invite), all roleanchored.

Escrow holds funds on accept/book; autorelease on completion with
dispute window.

Overtime and postcheckout extras can be added and charged midthread with
bothparty confirmation.

Cancellation policies selectable per SP (or package) and enforced with
prorated and exception handling.

Dispute center collects evidence, supports partial refunds, and logs
final decision.

Contracts & releases autoattached and esigned at checkout; PDFs stored
with booking.

Fees applied per model (12% provider, 5% buyer) with Instant Book and
verification adjustments.

Payouts: standard delay 48h; newprovider reserve/delay policy enforced.

Notifications & calendar work endtoend (email + inapp; ICS export).

Dashboards show accurate states and histories for both sides.

P\) Rationale (why this will convert)

Fewer steps + Instant Book = more completed bookings.

Packages + optional extras clarify scope and upsell without complexity.

Escrow + clear policies reduce buyer fear and provider noshow risk.

Disputes with evidence keep support load manageable and outcomes
predictable.

Fee incentives nudge the behavior we want (Instant Book, verification)
while keeping takerate competitive.

Contracts bakedin prevent most misunderstandings that plague legacy
platforms.

Addendum to §1.3 --- Travel & Distance Pricing & Logistics (FINAL)

1\) Product goals

Make travel predictable and fair for both sides.

Prevent accidental longdistance bookings.

Keep Instant Book clean (no surprise costs).

Support true longhaul bookings with clear rules (day rates, lodging,
perdiem) without overcomplicating MVP.

2\) Talent travel policy (per Service Profile)

Each SP (Model/Photographer/Videographer/Creator) sets:

A. Base location

Home city + map pin (hidden publicly; we show city/ZIPlevel to users).

B. Included radius

e.g., 15 mi included (no travel fee). Buyer search defaults to
radiusfiltered results.

C. Travel pricing model (choose one)

Permile beyond included radius (e.g., \$0.75/mi roundtrip, cap
optional), or

Pertime travel rate (e.g., \$30/hr drive time), or

Zones (simple flat fees):

Local (≤ included radius): \$0

Regional (e.g., 16--75 mi): flat \$X

Outofarea (e.g., 76--150 mi): flat \$Y

Longhaul (\>150 mi): Requestonly (no Instant Book), requires custom
quote (flight/train/hotel likely).

D. Longhaul rules (toggle per SP)

Travelday rate (if a day is lost to transit).

Lodging required (Yes/No; minimum star rating optional).

Perdiem (meal allowance) or "expenses at cost with receipts."
