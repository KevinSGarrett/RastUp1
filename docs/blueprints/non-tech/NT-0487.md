ed.\
• Security posture: secrets rotation; dependency updates; vulnerability
scans; pentest remediation.\
• Data quality: freshness, completeness, correctness checks; lineage;
rollback procedures.

Feature Flags & City Gates:\
• feature.perf.budgets, feature.logs.traces, feature.security.scanner,
feature.data.dq.gates.

Dependencies & Inputs:\
• SRE platform; security tooling; data platform; team time allocation;
leadership commitment.

Top Risks & Mitigations:\
• Feature pressure crowds out quality; silent regressions; security
drift; data incidents affecting finance.

Instrumentation & KPIs:\
• SLO compliance; incident counts and MTTA/MTTR; vuln backlog age; DQ
gate pass rates; perf budget adherence.

Acceptance Criteria (Go/No‑Go):\
✓ Error budgets green ≥ 80% of quarters; no Sev‑0 from preventable
causes; DQ gates pass with exceptions documented.

Staffing & Ownership:\
• SRE; Platform; Security; Data; Product owners accountable for quality
alongside features.

Milestones & Checkpoints:\
• Quarterly hardening sprints; dependency upgrade days; pentest
completion; DQ audit sign‑offs.

Implementation Notes:\
• Flag Discipline: Each capability ships behind a named flag with a
runbook, owner, rollback, and blast‑radius notes. Flags default to
\'off\' in new cities.\
• Admin Operability: No workstream is \'done\' until admin tools enable
Support/Trust/Finance to handle the top 3 edge cases without
engineering.\
• Copy & Policy: All flows have help‑center articles and email/SMS
templates; copy avoids legalese and links to policy examples.\
• QA & Drills: Staging mimics production data shapes; drills include
processor/tax outages, moderation surges, and incident command
handoffs.\
• Experimentation: Features that affect marketplace economics (ranking,
boosts, fees) include holdouts and guardrails; we measure incremental
impact.\
• Data Wiring: Events land in Bronze/Silver/Gold (§5); KPIs pull only
from Gold with freshness SLOs. Definitions live in a metrics catalog.\
• Accessibility: New UI complies with WCAG 2.1 AA; screen‑reader and
keyboard paths verified; contrast ratios checked; defects triaged.\
• Security & Privacy: PII masked by default; JIT elevation for sensitive
admin actions; vendor scopes minimal; audits immutable.\
• City Readiness: City‑first artifacts (press kit, creator ambassadors,
studio partners) prepared in §10.1 runbook.\
• Post‑Launch: 7/30/90‑day reviews convert observations into roadmap
changes; flags let us tune by city without forks.
