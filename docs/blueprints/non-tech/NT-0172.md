Separate SSO realms for Sandbox vs Prod (see §4.14.16).

Notebook policy: Analysts use gold_restricted via the semantic layer; no
direct vault access.

E\) Consent, Notices & Purpose Limitation

Clickwrap logs (ToS/Privacy) with version, IP/device, and timestamp (see
§4.14.15 G).

Edelivery consent for tax forms stored in vault; indicator mirrored in
Gold (edelivery_consent=true).

Marketing optout respected in messaging systems; flags exposed in Gold
as masked booleans for segmentation (no emails exported).

No secondary use: Any new purpose (e.g., external data sharing) triggers
a privacy review and Legal approval.

F\) Retention & Deletion (USfirst)

Retention profiles (aligned with §4.14.15 D; enforced by purge engine
with a nightly job and a purge ledger):

Deletion (DSR) rules (see §4.14.15 E):

When eligible: remove public content, mask profile, stop
discoverability; preserve finance/tax and any held records.

Tombstones replace names in historic receipts/threads.

Coolingoff window (e.g., 14 days) before irreversible purge.

G\) DeIdentification & Aggregate Sharing

kanonymity thresholds for public/marketing aggregates (e.g., k ≥ 15);
suppress small cells.

Noise injection (±1--3%) optional for externally shared rate metrics.

No raw media or NSFW content in public datasets; thumbnails only,
watermarked.

H\) Encryption, Keys & Secrets

In transit: TLS everywhere; mTLS for admin pipelines.

At rest: Serverside encryption for all buckets/tables; envelope
encryption for vault fields.

Key management: KMS with annual rotation; breakglass policy with dual
approval and full audit.

Secrets: Stored in a dedicated secrets manager; rotated quarterly or on
incident.

I\) DLP & Monitoring

Nightly DLP scans on Bronze/Silver/Gold for forbidden patterns (emails,
SSNs, card PANs).

Alerting to Observability (§4.14.13) on detection; repeat detections
escalate (autoquarantine offending tables).

Outbound controls: Email/SMS gateways block messages containing raw PII
pasted by agents; Admin redaction tool available (§4.14.1 E).

J\) ML & Analytics Privacy

Feature store uses Gold; no direct vault fields in features.

Fairness & privacy review for new models (ranking, risk).

Model cards record training data ranges, features used, evaluation
slices, and privacy notes; ml.prediction events include version and
feature hashes (§5.11).

PII in training notebooks prohibited; static analysis checks for vault
joins.

K\) Audits & Incident Response

PII access ledger: who, when, what columns, counts, reason, ticket id;
weekly digest to Privacy.

Data incidents: Runbook in §4.14.13---containment, scope, user comms
template, regulator threshold checks (US context), rootcause and CAPA
items.

External requests: handled through Legal intake (§4.14.15); gag orders
recorded and honored.

L\) Acceptance Criteria (mark §5.7 FINAL)

Privacy tiers wired into ingest; events with forbidden PII blocked at
edge.

Vault_PII schema live with column encryption, RBAC, and JIT unmask +
twoperson approvals.

Maskbydefault everywhere (UI, exports); watermarking of downloads
enabled.

Retention engine enforces schedules; purge ledger populated; legal holds
pause deletes.

DSR flows (access/export, deletion, optout) operational and logged;
tombstones applied on deletion.

DLP scans nightly with alerts; repeat violations autoquarantine.

Data residency set to US; keys managed via KMS with rotation; secrets
manager in place.

Analyst access constrained to gold_restricted + semantic layer; vault
denied by default.

ML privacy guardrails enforced: no vault joins in features; model cards
captured.

M\) Why this works

Least data, most value: We keep only what we need, as long as we need
it, where it's safest.

Operationally practical: Unmask flows are rare, justified, timeboxed,
and audited---yet Support/Tax can do their work.

Auditable & defensible: Clear ledgers, purge logs, and DLP alarms prove
compliance in audits and incidents.

Futureproof: USfirst, but patterns
