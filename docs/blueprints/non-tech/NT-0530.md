ent for
partner strategy and ecosystem development. It does not create
commitments. All integrations ship behind flags, follow privacy
policies, and require vendor due diligence, DPAs, SLAs, and legal
review. Commercial terms are illustrative until negotiated.

Context & Alignment: US‑only marketplace at launch; subscription‑free;
monetization via take‑rate and capped, eligibility‑gated usage‑based
promotions. Public content is artistic‑only with Safe‑Mode on for
guests. Deliverables flow via external links (Drive/Dropbox) with
immutable manifests; escrow releases on acceptance. Instant Book is
gated by ID verification; background checks are opt‑in (Trusted Pro).
Rollouts are city‑gated behind feature flags; Admin Console enforces
least‑privilege, JIT elevation, two‑person approvals, immutable audits,
and kill‑switches.

Goals:\
• Power verified social metrics, engagement filters, and growth trends
with official connections and compliant scopes.\
• Phase integration by feasibility and partner access, keeping link‑only
options where APIs are closed.

Target partner segments:\
• Instagram/Meta for verified metrics; YouTube/Google; TikTok; X
(Twitter); LinkedIn (Pages or partner access).\
• Third‑party analytics providers with compliant aggregation; link‑only
for others.

Mutual value proposition:\
• Buyers get confidence in reach/engagement; providers differentiate
with verified chips.\
• Platform gains unique discovery features and reasons to connect
accounts (stickiness).

Selection criteria & due diligence:\
• API scope minimalism; rate limits; clear policy; compliance with
platform terms; branding rules.\
• Ability to refresh nightly + manual refresh; fair use and quotas;
stability history.

Integration scopes & surfaces (what we build):\
• OAuth connects; fetch followers, ER, avg views; show verified chips;
trend sparklines.\
• Advanced metrics (phase 2) for connected accounts only; public
discovery within policy bounds.

Commercial & legal patterns (illustrative):\
• Typically no direct fees; rate‑limit & review constraints; potential
partner programs; compliance costs internal.

Enablement & co‑marketing (how we launch together):\
• Clear \'why connect\' copy; low‑friction OAuth; privacy info;
disconnect/self‑report options; verified‑only search toggle.

Top risks & mitigations:\
• API access changes; policy violations; misinterpretation of metrics;
rate‑limit induced outages.

Operational playbooks (summary):\
• Graceful degradation to self‑reported with \'unverified\' label; cache
and backoff; communicate transparently.

Owners & RACI:\
• Search/Data PMs; Legal; Security; Marketing for co‑marketing
approvals.

KPIs & leading indicators:\
• Connect rates; query usage for social filters; bookings uplift;
refresh success; support tickets on metrics.

Acceptance criteria (ready / successful when):\
✓ Verified chips working; nightly refresh within quotas; help content
clear; no policy violations.

Timeline & checkpoints:\
• Day‑1 IG/YT/TT/X; Phase‑2 LinkedIn if partner access; continuous
compliance reviews.

Scenario Playbook --- API quota exhaustion:\
Trigger: Refresh jobs fail due to rate limits\
Response: Backoff; prioritize top accounts; expose manual refresh
limits; show stale data banner.\
Legal/Comms: Help‑center notice; in‑product tooltip.\
Roll‑back/Forward: Re‑enable normal cadence after quota reset.\
Owner: Data/Search \| Telemetry: refresh_success, quota_usage \|
Evidence: Job logs; API responses

Implementation Notes:\
• Partner Governance: Maintain a single source of truth for partner
status (prospect, NDA, pilot, GA), contacts, contracts, scopes, and
SLAs. Tag all features behind partner flags and city gates to avoid
blast‑radius mistakes. • Privacy & Data: Apply least‑data
principles---only request scopes needed for the user value; rotate
tokens; revoke access on inactivity. • Security & Audits: Vendor
SOC/pentest reports stored with expiry reminders; incident bridges
pre‑arranged for Sev‑1/Sev‑0. • Co‑Market
