out readiness → enforce hard gates and
require sign‑off from Trust and Finance.\
• Admin gaps force engineering ops → refuse GA until support can act
without code changes.

Acceptance Criteria (Go/No‑Go):\
✓ All GA gates green for 14 consecutive days.\
✓ No Sev‑0s in last 14 days; Sev‑1 MTTR within target; drill passed in
last 30 days.\
✓ Help‑center content audited; macros cover top 20 issues.

Scenario Playbook --- Moderation backlog at Beta:\
Trigger: Unreviewed queue \> threshold for \>6 hours\
Response: Enable stricter Safe‑Mode; deploy extra moderators; add queue
limits; tune classifier thresholds.\
Roll‑back/Forward: Return thresholds; publish learnings; adjust appeals
capacity.\
Owner: Trust lead \| Telemetry: queue_length, SLA breach count, appeal
rate \| User Copy: "We're reviewing more submissions than usual. Uploads
remain safe but may take longer to appear."

Scenario Playbook --- Checkout latency spike:\
Trigger: p95 \> target; timeouts increasing\
Response: Scale workers; rate‑limit promos; prioritize ACH calls; turn
off non‑critical services via flags.\
Roll‑back/Forward: Restore gradually; compare error budget burn.\
Owner: SRE \| Telemetry: p95_checkout, error_rate, SLO burn \| User
Copy: "Brief delay processing payments; your card will not be charged
twice."

Implementation Notes:\
• Flags & City Gates: Every user‑visible change ships behind a flag with
a documented blast radius, an owner, and a rollback plan. City
allowlists prevent accidental national exposure. Admin has kill‑switches
for money and safety features with two‑person approval.\
• Admin Operability: No checklist is \'done\' unless Support can resolve
the top 3 edge cases without engineering and Trust can perform required
actions with an audit trail.\
• Help‑Center Alignment: All user‑facing copy is mirrored in the help
center with last‑updated dates and visual examples. We avoid legal
jargon; we explain outcomes and next steps.\
• QA Strategy: We prefer production‑like staging with seeded data and
synthetic bookings. We test under simulated load, outage, and edge cases
(ACH returns, 3DS failures, moderation queue spikes).\
• Holdouts & Experiments: Promotions, ranking, and any economic nudges
run with control cells and pre‑registered guardrails. We pause
experiments when guardrails breach.\
• Close‑the‑Loop: Post‑launch, we hold 7/30/90‑day reviews that tie
metrics to actions and retire ineffective steps.
