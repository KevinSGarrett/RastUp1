Fit Score (0--100): assistive signal explaining match to brief (style,
budget, distance, availability).

Award flow: select winner → escrow deposit (default 50%, configurable) →
Smart Docs esign session opens → booking created.

release without docs + acceptance.

H\) Delivery Room (storagesane delivery with verification)

Manifest = source of truth: Autogenerated from accepted quote
(counts/specs).

Storage model:

Previews on platform: webres photos & 720p video proxies; watermarks
allowed for previews.

Originals external: Google Drive / Dropbox / OneDrive / Box / S3
presigned owned by provider.

Ingestion:

OAuth mode (preferred): pull file list/metadata → pin manifest
(names/sizes/MIME/URLs).

Linkonly mode: paste share URLs; we crawl to create a readonly manifest.

Checksums: compute hashes for onplatform files; store length/etag for
externals; providers may paste SHA256 for finals.

Autochecks on upload: count, type/codec, pixel dimensions,
bitrate/duration, color profile, no watermarks on finals.

"All finals delivered" provider toggle validates against manifest.

I\) Acceptance, Revisions & AutoAccept

Technical acceptance: once autochecks pass, Buyer Review window opens.

Buyer Review: default 3 days (packageconfigurable) to accept, partial
accept (per milestone/group), or request inscope revisions (1 round
included).

Autoaccept: if buyer inactive after 3 days and autochecks passed, system
autoaccepts remaining deliverables; escrow releases per §1.3.

Change orders: outofscope requests routed to paid Change Order.

J\) Influence/Promo Deliverables (verification & enforcement)

Presets: IG Collab Post + Story Mentions; TikTok Post (+Duet/Stitch
optional); YouTube Short + Community Post.

Posting window & minimum live: buyer sets (e.g., post within 72h, remain
live ≥7 days).

Verification:

If accounts linked via OAuth, system autoverifies URL and monitors live
status.

If not linked, provider submits the public URL; system captures a
snapshot & status; buyer confirms.

Noncompliance: autoopens a deliverable dispute → 24h cure window →
partial refund equal to the allocated value if missed/removed.

K\) Attendance, NoShows, Disputes (fast, evidencebased)

Checkin/out: both parties tap Start/End (geofenced, ±60 min).

Evidence log: timestamps, geotags, chat/call logs (durations),
manifests, behindthescenes snaps.

Buyer noshow / late cancel: refunds per policy (e.g., 72--24h = 50%
payout; \<24h = 100% payout).

Provider noshow: buyer 100% refund + goodwill credit; provider
reliability strike & Instant Book pause.

Deliverables shortfall: 48h cure window; else partial refund
proportional to undelivered items.

Subjective disputes: one revision → Neutral Review (scopebased outcome:
reedit or partial refund).

Safety exception: fee waivers/credits as needed; safety review
autoopens.

L\) Boards & Collaboration

Boards: named shortlists with status tags ("New, Invited, Proposed,
Awarded").

Teamwork: \@mentions, comments, polls; readonly share link; optional NDA
gate for external reviewers.

badge after 14 days.

scope/budget, drafts invites, schedules top 3 for 15min slots; nudges
for NDA and verifiedonly toggles.
