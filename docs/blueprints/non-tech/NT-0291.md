 links; redact PII in
views; never edit originals; legal holds override deletion where

• Copy Clarity: explain outcomes and next steps; avoid citing laws in
emails; link to help‑center with examples.\
• Training: quarterly refreshers for T&S, Support, Finance; FCRA basics;
chargeback representment; accessibility etiquette.\
• Measurement: we track leading/lagging indicators to tune thresholds
and staffing.

Implementation Notes:\
• Feature Flags & City Gates: externally visible policy toggles ship
behind flags; Admin can rollback with a two‑step confirmation; events
are audited.\
• Admin Operability: every rule has a corresponding tool in Admin
(approve/deny/redact/pause/escalate) with immutable logs.\
• Evidence Hygiene: store hashes and immutable links; redact PII in
views; never edit originals; legal holds override deletion where
applicable.\
• Copy Clarity: explain outcomes and next steps; avoid citing laws in
emails; link to help‑center with examples.\

Context & Alignment: We are launching a US‑only creative marketplace
focused on models, photographers, videographers, and content creators.\
We have chosen a subscription‑free go‑to‑market with monetization via
take‑rate and optional, usage‑based promotions that are
eligibility‑gated and capped.\
Public content is artistic‑nudity‑only; Safe‑Mode defaults for guests
apply. Deliverables are transferred via external storage (Drive/Dropbox)
with immutable manifests.\
Payments flow through card (3DS where required) and ACH (with a
buyer‑fee discount); funds are escrowed and released on acceptance.\
Instant Book is gated by ID verification; background checks are opt‑in
(Trusted Pro). Feature flags and city gates are used for reversible,
auditable launches.\
Admin consoles enable Support, Trust & Safety, Finance, and Ops to
perform routine tasks without code changes.

Goals:\
• Respond lawfully and narrowly to valid legal process while protecting
user privacy and safety.\
• Provide an emergency disclosure path for imminent harm consistent with
law.\
• Maintain impeccable audit trails and chain‑of‑custody for any data
disclosed.

Scope & Applicability:\
Applies to all requests from government entities, private litigants, and
law enforcement seeking user data.

Definitions (plain language):\
• Legal Process: a subpoena, court order, or warrant that compels
disclosure of certain records.\
• Emergency Disclosure: a request asserting imminent harm to a person;
processed under a defined policy.\
• Notice: where permitted by law, informing users that their data has
been requested.

Policy Statements:\
• Intake: verify authority, scope, and jurisdiction; reject over‑broad
or improper requests; require correct service.\
• Notice: unless legally barred, inform the user with a copy of the
request and time to object.\
• Narrow tailoring: produce only what is specified; prefer metadata over
content where lawful.\
• Chain of custody: hash and inventory produced files; store in
restricted evidence repository.\
• Emergency requests: accept via official channels; require written
confirmation; log and review post‑hoc.

Procedures & Operational Playbooks:\
• Admin integration: §4.14.15 legal holds; evidence tagging; restricted
access groups.\
• Escalation: counsel reviews; senior approval for con
