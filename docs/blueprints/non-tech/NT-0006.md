Verified social metrics & audience demographics are available via
firstparty APIs when the creator connects their accounts (details §5).
TikTok Creator Marketplace & IG Graph API support verified metrics for
optedin professional accounts; YouTube API provides channel stats.

5\) Social Metrics: Live, Verified & Searchable

What's possible (2025):

Instagram (Graph API): For Creator/Business accounts that connect, we
can fetch followers_count, media stats, and some insights; Business
Discovery lets you query other professional accounts' public metrics
within policy. (Regular personal accounts are limited.)

YouTube Data/Analytics APIs: Provide subscriber counts, view counts,
watch time & more for connected channels.

TikTok: Via Login/Display API we can show connected profile/video info;
richer audience/engagement demographics are available through Creator
Marketplace / Business integrations for optedin creators/partners.

OnlyFans: No official public API; thirdparty wrappers rely on
reverseengineering and are not official or guaranteed. So we should not
promise live OF metrics; we can let creators link OF and selfdisclose
stats, optionally verified manually.

Product approach:

"Connect Socials" module for any role. If connected, we show a Verified
Social badge + live counts on profile & enable search filters
(followers/engagement/growth/audience geos) for those users.

Privacy & consent: Only metrics the user consents to share are displayed
and indexed.

Fallback when not connected: userentered stats (clearly marked
Unverified; not searchable by metrics).

Data freshness: sync nightly; fast ondemand refresh button with
ratelimits.

6\) Packages & Extras (Fiverrstyle) --- Required on every Service
Profile

Each role supports:

Packages (Basic / Standard / Premium) with deliverables, turnaround,
revision count, and price.

Extras (addons): examples by role

Models: "Wardrobe change packs", "Travel to location (miles)", "Social
shoutout addon", "Rush booking"

Photographers: "Extra edited images", "Rush delivery", "RAWs", "Studio
included", "MUA coordination"

Videographers: "Extra revisions", "Captions/subtitles", "Vertical
cutdowns", "Thumbnail package"

Creators: "Extra story frames", "Link in bio (X days)", "Pin post (X
days)", "Crosspost to TikTok"

Usage/licensing tiers (Commercial / Paid Ads / Exclusive / Buyout) with
clear pricing.

Instant Book allowed when provider sets autorules (e.g., package X,
availability, radius).

This removes TFP ambiguity and makes booking pure ecommerce: see options
→ add extras → pay → schedule.

7\) Fixing the "Manual Networking" Problem (for low and highfollower
users)

A. Instant Book + Smart Availability

Talent can optin to Instant Book by defining guardrails (packages,
calendar windows, location radius). Search filter "Instant Book" shows
readytobook now talent.

Smart availability filter: pick date/time → show only available Service
Profiles.

B. Smart Invites (private, not a job board)

A buyer can select up to N profiles and send a single, personalized
booking invite that reaches each privately (no public listing).

Autoaccept rules (for busy/highfollower talent): "autoaccept if: package
≥ \$X, travel ≤ Y, brand safe, date in my windows."

C. Concierge (Pro)

For VIPs and brands: a paid Concierge that assembles shortlists, handles
invites, negotiates packages/extras, and schedules. Revenue:
subscription or perengagement fee.

D. Collab Mode (for highhigh, noncash)

Zerocash collaboration contracts with deliverables (shoot + crossposting
obligations). Both sides sign; platform tracks performance (proofofpost,
content delivered).

We monetize via Pro plan features, not commission, and still accrue
reviews + reliability metrics.
