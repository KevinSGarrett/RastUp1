 Reputation.

Ranking: Rep Score is a tiebreaker after relevance, availability,
distance, price.

Paid Boosting (pricing & rules detailed later in Monetization):

Search can render Promoted placements (Search Boost, Profile Highlight)
only if the result still matches all active filters.

Enforce ad density caps (e.g., ≤2 promoted in top 20; ≤1 above the
fold).

Eligibility checks (Rep ≥ 70, ID Verified, no recent strikes) come from
§1.5 signals.

§1.2.11 Acceptance Criteria (Search addendum)

Search supports perplatform filters (IG, YT, TT, X), Verifiedonly
toggle, and ANY/ALL logic; Phase2 placeholders for
LinkedIn/Facebook/Snapchat.

Result cards show perplatform chips with verified tooltips; profile
pages show chips + trend sparklines.

Engagement filters offer Simple (Top 10/20%) and Advanced (ER %, Avg
views) modes; tooltips explain each metric plainly.

Filters for trust signals (Studio Verified, Verified references, Min Rep
Score) are available and integrated into ranking as specified.

Promoted slots render with clear labeling, density caps, and only within
matching searches.

Addendum to §1.2 --- Search (Models/Creators) --- Comfort & Boundary
Filters + FanSubscription Creators (FINAL)

Policy anchor: We're mainstreamfirst. Artistic nudity (nonexplicit) is
allowed; explicit sexual content/acts are not. All nudityrelated options
are 18+ and IDgated (see §3.4). Processors remain mainstreamsafe.

A\) Comfort & Boundary Filters (visible on Model/Creator profiles & in
search)

Nudity tier (multiselect, 18+ only):

No Nudity

Lingerie/Swimwear

Implied Nudity (no explicit exposure)

Topless (nonsexualized context; policycompliant)

Artistic Nude (nonexplicit; no sexual acts)

Content boundaries (toggle chips): sheer/seethrough, bodypaint, boudoir,
glamour, fetish (not allowed) clearly flagged as disallowed.

Comfort notes: freetext "Do/Don't" section (e.g., "comfortable with
implied shower scenes; no oil/latex").

Chaperone policy: "Chaperone welcome" toggle; "Femaleonly teams
preferred" toggle.

Search panel gets these as filters; results show chips like "Artistic
Nude • Chaperone OK".

B\) FanSubscription Creators (e.g., OnlyFans/Fansly) --- role & search
support

Role mapping: treat as a Creator subtype: "FanSubscription Creator".

Portfolio rules: no explicit sexual content on our platform; link outs
allowed in a dedicated "Links" section.

Metrics: since there's no reliable public API, show selfreported
subscriber counts with "Unverified" label; allow manual verification on
request (e.g., screenshot billing dashboard → staff verifies → "Verified
by Platform" chip).

Search filters: "FanSubscription Creator: Yes", Subscriber count
(selfreported), Open to Collabs toggle.

Collab deliverables: add preset deliverables like IG Collab Post, Story
Mention, TT Duet/Stitch, with posting windows (e.g., within 72h) and
link verification (see §3.5 addendum below).

C\) Age & Policy Gates

IDverified 18+ required to select any nudity tier above
Lingerie/Swimwear.

Booking form includes Nudity & Boundaries step; both parties confirm
tiers and chaperone policy.

Autoflagging: briefs requesting explicit sexual acts are blocked with
policy guidance.

D\) Acceptance Criteria

Search filters for Nudity Tier, Chaperone OK, Comfort notes present;
chips displayed on cards/profile.

Creator subtype "FanSubscription Creator" live; linkout section;
selfreported metrics with "Unverified" label + optional manual verify.

Booking brief includes Nudity & Boundaries acknowledgments; ID gate
enforced.
