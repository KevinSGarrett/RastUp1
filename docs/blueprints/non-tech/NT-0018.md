d radius): \$0

Regional (e.g., 16--75 mi): flat \$X

Outofarea (e.g., 76--150 mi): flat \$Y

Longhaul (\>150 mi): Requestonly (no Instant Book), requires custom
quote (flight/train/hotel likely).

D. Longhaul rules (toggle per SP)

Travelday rate (if a day is lost to transit).

Lodging required (Yes/No; minimum star rating optional).

Perdiem (meal allowance) or "expenses at cost with receipts."

Flight class policy (e.g., economy basic/economy).

These appear automatically when the distance exceeds the SP's Longhaul
threshold.

E. Instant Book guardrails

Maximum travel distance/time eligible for Instant Book (e.g., ≤25 mi or
≤45 mins driving).

Anything beyond becomes RequesttoBook (forces a conversation/quote).

F. Touring calendar (optional)

Talent can publish "On tour" dates (e.g., "In Dallas Nov 12--13").

On those dates, search treats them as local to that city (travel fees
suppressed/adjusted).

3\) Buyer search & guardrails

Default search radius (e.g., 25 mi) with a conspicuous "Expand radius"
toggle.

Results beyond the SP's Instant Book limit display "Travel
required---Request to Book."

"Visiting talent" toggle shows users who've set touring dates in the
buyer's city/date.

If a buyer selects a date/location first, we prefilter to available &
traveleligible profiles only.

4\) Travel fee calculation (checkout)

We estimate distance/time using a mapping service (e.g., Distance Matrix
API) based on talent's base location and the buyer's shoot location,
then apply the SP's chosen model (Permile/Pertime/Zones).

Line items at checkout:

Package price

Travel fee (breakdown: miles/time/zones)

Extras (if any)

License tier (if any)

Platform fee(s), tax (where applicable)

For longhaul: Instant Book disabled; buyer sees "Travel quote required."
The request flow collects flight/hotel expectations and/or "expenses at
cost" consent.

Dallas ↔ Houston example (longhaul):

If distance exceeds SP's Longhaul threshold (e.g., 150 mi), checkout
switches to RequesttoBook. The SP's longhaul rules (travel day, lodging,
perdiem) appear automatically so both sides know the terms before money
is held.

5\) Dayof transportation (local rides)

We considered offering buyers the option to prepay a rideshare for
talent. Here's the practical approach:

MVP recommendation:

Do not directly book rides inside our app. Instead, let buyers:

Cover travel via the Travel fee (fixed & predictable), or

Offer a "Local ride credit" addon (flat \$ amount) that the talent can
use as they wish.

Why not deep rideshare integration for MVP?

Uber's consumer Ride Request widget is deprecated; today they recommend
deep links to m.uber.com/app rather than thirdparty apps creating rides
endtoend.

Uber for Business and Vouchers API (and Lyft Concierge API) exist, but
they're designed for enterprise programs (credits/vouchers/guest rides),
which adds account setup, policy, reconciliation, and support overhead
we don't need at launch.

Phase2 option (if demand is strong):

Add an "Attach rides voucher" flow for enterprise buyers using Uber for
Business Vouchers or Lyft Concierge, where the buyer funds a capped ride
credit tied to the booking. We'd still keep our Travel fee logic for
nonvoucher cases.

6\) Preventing bad bookings

Hard stops: If distance \> SP's Max travel allowed, booking cannot
proceed (UI explains "Out of travel range; request a remote option or
choose visiting dates").

Soft stops: If distance triggers longhaul, we force RequesttoBook and
surface the SP's travel rules.

Calendar conflicts: Long travel times also block adjacent slots (buffer)
to avoid doublebooking.

7\) Payments & escrow for travel

Travel fees are part of the escrow amount and follow the same
cancellation/dispute policy as the job (unless flagged as nonrefundable
expenses after tickets/hotels are purchased with buyer approval).

For expenses at cost workflows (flight/hotel receipts): provider uploads
receipts → buyer approves → platform charges card and adds to escrow or
