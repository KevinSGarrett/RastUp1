ch will be done in phases with clear timelines and
milestones to keep the team on track. We will use a milestone-based city
launch plan that breaks the process into manageable stages from
pre-launch through post-launch. Below is an outline of the launch
timeline for each city:

Pre-Launch Preparation (T-minus 6 Weeks): Approximately six weeks before
the public launch, our advance team (especially the recruiter) is on the
ground in the new city. Key activities in this phase include finalizing
local hires, securing any necessary office space or equipment, meeting
with prospective partners, and launching initial teaser marketing (e.g.
"coming soon" campaigns). By the end of this phase, we aim to have a
trained local core team in place and all major operational issues
resolved before full launch.

Launch Execution (Weeks 1--4 of Launch): This marks the official launch
period when our service becomes available in the city. The city launch
team arrives in full to execute the playbook. In the first 4 weeks, the
team focuses on hitting early milestones: onboarding initial customers
and/or service providers, ensuring service quality, and monitoring KPIs
closely (for example, reaching a target number of active users or
transactions by week 4). During this phase, the launch team works
hands-on alongside the new local hires, demonstrating processes and
solving problems in real time. We maintain a checklist of critical
milestones (e.g. system infrastructure stable, first 100 customers
acquired, first local partnership deal signed, customer satisfaction
above threshold) that should be achieved by the end of Week 4. Hitting
these targets confirms the launch is gaining traction as expected.

Knowledge Transfer & Transition (Weeks 5--10): Around week 5, once the
initial launch goals are met, the focus shifts to transferring full
operational control to the local team. From Week 5 through Week 10, the
city launch team gradually steps back while coaching the local team to
handle all aspects of the business. During this transition, standard
operating procedures are reviewed, and any local adjustments are
documented. The launch team ensures the new team is comfortable with
maintaining quality and growth. By about the tenth week, our goal is
that the local team can run the city independently, with the central
launch team only in a support role. A final review is done at Week 10 to
decide if the city is on track (meeting the KPI targets set out) and if
the launch team can fully exit to focus on the next city.

Each phase has explicit milestones and deliverables, allowing us to
track progress and address issues promptly. This milestone-based
approach creates accountability and clarity -- everyone knows what
"success" looks like at each stage of the launch. If a milestone is not
met (for example, if user acquisition falls short in Week 2-3), the team
can pause and troubleshoot or deploy additional resources to fix the
issue before proceeding. By structuring the city launch in phases, we
ensure a disciplined rollout and reduce the risk of launching without
the necessary foundations in place.

2.5 Post-Launch Monitoring & Scaling Strategy

Launching in a new city is not the end of the process -- it's the
beginning of that city's growth journey. After the initial launch and
handoff, we will have systems in place to monitor performance, support
the local team, and continuously improve our expansion playbook for
future cities.

Firstly, we will set up a city monitoring function to oversee the health
of all launched cities. This could be a small centralized team or a
regular review process that uses our KPI framework to track each city's
metrics (e.g. growth rate, revenue, customer satisfaction) against
targets. The purpose is to ensure consistency and quality across cities,
catching any post-launch issues early. We may implement standard
compliance checks or quality audits (akin to an internal "city
operations QA" program) to verify that each city is mainta
