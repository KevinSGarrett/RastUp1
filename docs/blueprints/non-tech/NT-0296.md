emails; link to help‑center with examples.\
• Training: quarterly refreshers for T&S, Support, Finance; FCRA basics;
chargeback representment; accessibility etiquette.\

• Admin Operability: every rule has a corresponding tool in Admin
(approve/deny/redact/pause/escalate) with immutable logs.\
• Evidence Hygiene: store hashes and immutable links; redact PII in

§8.9 --- Accessibility & Anti‑Discrimination Commitments

Disclaimer: This document is a policy and process blueprint intended for

compliance advice. Consult qualified counsel before publishing external
policies or taking actions that create legal obligations. All examples

Context & Alignment: We are launching a US‑only creative marketplace
focused on models, photographers, videographers, and content creators.\
We have chosen a subscription‑free go‑to‑market with monetization via
take‑rate and optional, usage‑based promotions that are
eligibility‑gated and capped.\
Public content is artistic‑nudity‑only; Safe‑Mode defaults for guests
apply. Deliverables are transferred via external storage (Drive/Dropbox)
with immutable manifests.\
Payments flow through card (3DS where required) and ACH (with a
buyer‑fee discount); funds are escrowed and released on acceptance.\
Instant Book is gated by ID verification; background checks are opt‑in
(Trusted Pro). Feature flags and city gates are used for reversible,
auditable launches.\
