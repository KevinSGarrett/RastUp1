ent is artistic‑nudity‑only; Safe‑Mode defaults for guests
apply. Deliverables are transferred via external storage (Drive/Dropbox)
with immutable manifests.\
Payments flow through card (3DS where required) and ACH (with a
buyer‑fee discount); funds are escrowed and released on acceptance.\
Instant Book is gated by ID verification; background checks are opt‑in
(Trusted Pro). Feature flags and city gates are used for reversible,
auditable launches.\
Admin consoles enable Support, Trust & Safety, Finance, and Ops to
perform routine tasks without code changes.

Goals:\
• Provide standard templates and a Smart Docs system that aligns
expectations and IP rights before the shoot.\
• Prevent downstream disputes over usage by capturing license scope and
compensation clearly.\
• Respect creators' copyrights while enabling buyers to license what
they need.

Scope & Applicability:\
Applies to all paid bookings where deliverables or usage rights are
exchanged via the platform. TFP/collaboration bookings may use
lightweight agreements but still require model releases where faces are
identifiable.

Definitions (plain language):\
• Statement of Work (SOW): scope, deliverables, timeline, compensation,
change‑order process.\
• Model Release: consent by a person depicted to use their likeness
under specified terms.\
• License: the permission granted by the rights holder to use content in
defined ways; may be exclusive or nonexclusive.\
• Assignment: transfer of ownership of the IP; rare and requires
explicit agreement and additional compensation.

Policy Statements:\
• Default posture: the creator (photographer/videographer) owns the
copyright; buyers obtain a license selected at checkout.\
• License tiers: social/web; advertising; commercial print; broadcast;
each with territory/duration options and price add‑ons.\
• Model releases: required for identifiable persons; stored with
booking; expiration and revocation terms spelled out.\
• Change orders: add‑on licenses post‑shoot are supported; receipts
amended; SOW updated in Smart Docs.\
• Moral rights: where applicable, we avoid derogatory treatment clauses;
we permit credit removal if safety requires.\
• No hidden assignments: platform license is limited to hosting,
processing, and displaying content for the service.

Procedures & Operational Playbooks:\
• Pre‑shoot: SOW and release e‑sign; deliverables and license selected;
both parties see plain‑English summaries.\
• Post‑shoot: deliverables manifest posted; acceptance triggers license
effectiveness; upgrades handled via change order.\
• Disputes: receipts, SOW, and releases become the definitive record;
support follows playbook to assess scope.

Enforcement & Remedies:\
• Breach: failure to deliver or misuse of content triggers remedies
(refunds, takedown, license suspension).\
• Infringement: DMCA process for third‑party claims; internal
investigation where platform features are misused.\
• Bad‑faith buyers/providers: sanctions include loss of Trusted Pro,
promotions eligibility, or account limits.

Data, Privacy & Retention:\
• Data retention: SOW/releases stored 7 years; hashes captured for
integrity; minimal PII in public artifacts.\
• Privacy: releases and SOW not publicly displayed; only status and
scope summaries shown to the counterparty.

Templates & Required Notices (internal/external):\
• Templates: SOW per role; model release variants; license matrix;
change‑order terms; takedown request forms.\
• Help‑center: \'Which license do I need?\' wizard; examples of common
scenarios.

Compliance Metrics & Audits:\
• Dispute rate related to license scope; frequency of change‑order
upgrades; time‑to‑sign for SOW/releases; takedown SLAs.

Risks & Mitigations:\
• Ambiguous license language → publish examples; require plain‑English
summaries; prohibit hidden assignments.\
• Edge cases (e.g., collage, AI stylization) → add addenda and clarify
derivative works rights.
