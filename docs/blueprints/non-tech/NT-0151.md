arch & collect: entity filters (user, booking range, city), keyword
search across chats and metadata, time bounds.\
Review workspace: preview items with PII masked by default; unmask
gated; tag (responsive/nonresponsive/privileged).\
Redaction tools: blocklist (emails/phones/payment handles), manual
area/line redaction in PDFs, autoredact minors' identifiers.\
Production packages:

Formats: PDF (with redactions), CSV/JSON for structured data, original
media hashes and links (we provide manifests for thirdparty storage like
Drive/Dropbox rather than duplicating large files).

Hash manifest (per file + whole set), cover letter, case metadata.

Chainofcustody: who exported, when, with which scopes; twoperson
approval for release.

Notification rules: where permitted, notify users whose data is
produced; suppressed if gag order recorded.

G\) Policies & ClickWrap/Consent Logs

ToS/Privacy versions, with acceptance timestamps, IP/device, and
surfaces (web/app).

Edelivery consent (tax forms) and marketing consents with granularity
(email/SMS).

Changes: version diffs stored; user reconsent waves scheduled via
§4.14.10.

Download: CSV of acceptance logs by cohort (PII masked) for audits.

H\) Integrations

Trust & Safety (§4.14.3): reference cases, import preserved evidence
into holds; share redacted summaries.

Support & Disputes (§4.14.5): DSR status surface to agents; macro
responses.

Finance & Tax (§4.14.6/§4.14.7): retention overrides for financial/tax
records; W9/1099 forms access gated to Legal.

Docs CMS (§4.14.10): generate cover letters, denial reasons,
clarification requests, and disclosure receipts.

I\) Metrics & SLAs

KPIs

DSR intake volume; % completed on time; average completion days.

Holds applied/active/reviewed; average hold age.

Productions count; average time from verified request → production;
redaction error rate (\<1%).

Purge job throughput and exceptions; records deleted vs retained (by
policy).

Consent coverage: ToS/Privacy acceptance %, Edelivery consent %.

Alerts

DSR backlog \> threshold or any nearing SLA breach (T7/T3/T1 days).

Holds older than review cadence.

Purge errors \> threshold; production export failures.

J\) Telemetry (Legal & Records)

legal.request.intake (type, jurisdiction) • legal.request.verify

legal.hold.apply/release/review

legal.dsr.open/verify/start/complete/deny (code)

legal.purge.simulate/run/fail • legal.policy.update (retention profile)

legal.discovery.search/tag/redact/export

legal.disclosure.approve/release (twoperson)

legal.consent.accept/revoke (tos\|privacy\|edelivery\|marketing)

K\) Acceptance Criteria (mark 4.14.15 FINAL)

Intake & verification flow for subpoenas/LE requests with case vault,
SLA timers, and clarification templates.

Legal holds that freeze deletion and display banners; twoperson approval
to release; periodic review reminders.

Retention schedules configurable; purge engine with simulation, nightly
runs, and purge ledger.

DSR: access/export ZIP with redactions & hashes; deletion flow with
tombstones, coolingoff, and eligibility rules; optout toggles logged.

Discovery workspace: search, masked preview, tagging, redaction,
production with hashed manifest and chainofcustody; twoperson release
approval.

Clickwrap & consent logs queryable and exportable.

Integrations with T&S, Support, Finance/Tax, and Smart Docs;
notifications per policy/gag orders.

Metrics & alerts dashboards; Telemetry events emitted for all actions;
RBAC & PII scopes enforced.

L\) Why this works

Defensible: verified intake, documented holds, hashed productions, and
auditable purges.

Practical: redaction and manifests avoid duplicating huge media while
still producing what's required.

Safe by default: masking, leastprivilege, and twoperson approvals keep
sensitive actions controlled.

Lowcode ops: Legal drives routine compliance without engineering; only
edge cases need dev help.

Goal: Give every ops team a safe, realistic playgroun
