Acceptance checklist (risk under control when):\
□ Daily close green 14 days; chargeback kit quality audits ≥95%; tax
reconciliations tight; invalid‑click credits automated.

Scenario Deep‑Dive --- Chargeback ring:\
Context: Clustered BIN and IPs; services not rendered claims.\
Trigger: Chargeback rate spikes; win rate drops.\
Immediate actions: Flag accounts; require IDV; strengthen acceptance
gating; proactive provider coaching; notify processor risk team.\
Communication: Help‑center post on acceptance and deliverables; targeted
provider emails.\
Rollback/Forward: Relax after rate normalizes; keep monitoring for
recurrence.\
Owner: Finance/Payments \| Telemetry: chargeback_rate, win_rate \|
Evidence: Receipts, chats, SOW, manifest, acceptance timestamps

Execution Notes:\
• Every risk has a dashboard tile with an owner, a definition of the
denominator, and a weekly narrative. • Risk reviews pair with §10
post‑launch 7/30/90‑day reviews and §8 compliance calendar. • Where a
risk spans multiple squads, the city GM or Risk DRI chairs the review;
actions have due dates. • We prefer reversible changes (flags) and
narrow blast radius (city gates). • We avoid \'security by obscurity\';
we publish clear user guidance, train staff, and keep audit trails for
all sensitive actions. • The risk register itself is versioned; changes
record rationale and observed metrics.
