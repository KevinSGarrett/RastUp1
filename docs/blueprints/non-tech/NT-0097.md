h.

Deposit hold fail (Studio): surface amount & bank advice; offer to
remove Studio or retry.

Doublebooking race: if availability disappears between Details and Pay,
show conflict modal with alternatives.

Early exit policy note (Studio): no prorata refunds unless host agrees;
checkout governs overtime only.

No rideshare integration at v1: travel is seller configurable; buyers
may arrange transport independently.

L\) Accessibility, Performance & Privacy

Accessibility: logical heading order; labeled inputs; ARIA for steppers
and docs list; keyboardable signature.

Performance: TTI \< 2.5s; defer SDKs (ACH/OAuth/3DS) until opened;
skeletons for panels; cache price calcs clientside.

Privacy: exact studio address hidden until confirm; only general area
shown prior; emails/push never contain 18+ previews.

M\) Telemetry

checkout.open (type=talent\|studio\|group)

checkout.validate.ok/fail (reason=availability\|min_hours\|conflict)

docs.sign (doc type) • docs.amend.issued/accepted

payment.method.select (card\|ach) • payment.attempt.success/fail
(reason)

deposit.authorize.success/fail (amount)

checkout.confirm.success (single\|group)

cancel.preview.open • cancel.submit (outcome per booking)

reschedule.propose/accept (group=Y/N)

promo.apply (city_promo\|code)

fee.tooltip.view (engagement proxy)

N\) Acceptance Criteria (mark 4.7 FINAL)

Single & group checkouts implemented with steppers, perbooking panels,
and a group total for LBG.

Smart Docs packs (Talent: SOW/License/Release; Studio: Property/Space
Release + House Rules + Safety Addendum) are esigned before payment;
amended docs reissued on changes.

Payment supports Card and ACH (ACH reduces buyer fee to 3% when
enabled); handles 3DS; logs outcomes.

Escrow collected per booking; Studio deposit hold authorized (not GMV).

Atomic LBG: both bookings must succeed or none confirm; failure guidance
provided.

Policies & refunds previewed per booking; cancellation modal computes
outcomes; receipts show split lines and deposit authorization.

Reschedule & change order flows are LBGaware (sync or split), with
reauth when totals change.

Travel fees (Talent) calculated from role settings (zones/mi beyond
included radius).

Accessibility, performance, privacy baselines met; telemetry events
fire.

O\) Why this works

Confidence to commit: Contracts signed before money moves; fees and
policies are crystalclear.

Simple for buyers, correct for finance: One checkout & receipt---even
for two bookings---while ledgers stay separate.

Fewer support tickets: Evidencefirst docs, deposit holds, and policy
previews reduce disputes.

Launchready: Card + ACH, IB + Request, and AttachinFlow cover the common
paths without building a full billing platform.

§4.8 --- Delivery Room & Acceptance

Goal: Provide a storagesane, evidencefirst workspace for handing off
creative work, managing proofs → selects → finals, verifying promo/UGC
deliverables, and closing out bookings with clear acceptance timers that
trigger payouts and reduce disputes.

A\) Routes & Ownership

Buyer view: /booking/{id}/delivery (read/approve/request revisions).

Seller view: /booking/{id}/delivery (author/publish/revise).

Studio bookings: show readonly timeline (checkin/out, docs); no Delivery
Room (studios don't deliver files).

Linked Booking Group: each booking has its own Delivery Room; LBG
summary links to each.

B\) Concepts & Stages

Manifest --- authoritative list of deliverables (filenames/links +
checksums, size, type, version).

Proofs --- lowres watermarked images / lowbitrate proxies for video; no
originals on platform.

Selects --- buyer picks which proofs should be finalized (if package
includes selection).

Finals --- fullspec outputs referenced via external links
(Drive/Dropbox/OneDrive/S3) + optional onplatform proxy; license applies
on acceptance.

UGC/Promo --- a verified post on IG/YT/TT/X with link and API check +
required minlive window.

Storagesane principle: We host previews/proxies only; origi
