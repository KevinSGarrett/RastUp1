bels & notes: Private labels ("VIP", "High budget", "No reshoots")
visible only to you.

Voice notes (Phase 2) and video call link (Phase 2) if needed---kept
lightweight.

G\) File handling & delivery guardrails

Supported types & limits (MVP):

Images up to 25MB each; Videos up to 500MB; Docs up to 50MB; Zips up to
1GB

Perthread storage cap (e.g., 10GB) with option to add more (paid or Pro
plan)

Preview & watermark: Proofs autowatermarked (provider setting). Finals
unlock watermark once client taps Accept or escrow autoreleases.

Large deliverables: Allow external links (Drive/Dropbox), autocapture
file manifest (name/size/checksum), and warn on expired links.

Versioning: When reuploading finals, keep prior version accessible with
timestamps.

Retention: Files retained for N months after completion (export
reminders sent before purge).

Copyright & license: Display active usage license above deliverables;
warning if buyer requests use beyond license.

H\) Safety & moderation

Safety flag (red button):

Reasons: harassment, unsafe location, payment pressure, illegal request,
explicit content violations, impersonation, other.

Immediate priority route to Support; autosuspend of Instant Book on the
accused until triage; discreet handling.

Checkin: Optional "I've arrived / I'm leaving" timestamps; can share
general location radius with counterparty; private to thread & support.

Block & report: One tap to block future messages; reporting requires a
short reason.

Automoderation:

Contact sharing & offplatform payment detection → inline warning +
educational tooltip ("You lose escrow protection, reviews, and
cancellation coverage offplatform").

NSFW policy enforcement: image scanning + manual review queues for
suspected violations.

Privacy defaults: Email/phone hidden; reveal toggle after booking
(optional per user).

DND / Quiet hours: Peruser settings; requests still deliver silently
with summaries.

I\) Anticircumvention (fair + educational)

Prebooking: External payment links/phrases prompt an educational nudge
and are softblocked; persistent attempts throttle sender's
newconversation ability.

Postbooking: External coordination is allowed (we still encourage
onplatform for records); deliverables & approvals should remain in
project for dispute coverage.

Value reminders: Periodic banners highlight benefits: escrow,
cancellation coverage, verified reviews, analytics, and search boost for
verified users.

J\) Notifications

Push/email for: new message, invite/request received, accepted/declined,
payment captured, files uploaded, approvals requested, reschedule
proposal, dispute updates, payout sent.

Digest mode: For busy users, bundle notifications every X hours unless
"Booking day" (then realtime).

K\) Roles & permissions

Owner participants: buyer & provider (full read/write).

Secondary participants (optional): assistants, MUA/stylist; invited by
owner; readonly or filesonly permission; cannot alter payments or
policies.

Tag & consent workflow: When provider tags a collaborator on media, that
user receives an Approve/Decline card in chat; on approve, media appears
on both profiles (rolescoped per §1.2/§1.1).

L\) Tieins to other modules

Booking & Payments (§1.3): Add extras, overtime, expenses from chat;
payment capture + escrow state visible in header & Project Panel.

Search & Profiles (§1.2/§1.1): Response time & reliability metrics
update based on chat behavior (first response SLA, noshow, delivery
confirmations).

Verification (§1.1): Verified users get extra newconversation credits
and priority inbox surfacing.

M\) MVP vs. Phase2

MVP

Unified inbox; roleaware threads; read receipts & typing

Project Panel (Summary, Schedule, Location, Participants, Brief,
Moodboard, Shot List, Call Sheet, Files, Contracts, Expenses, Actions)

Action cards (reschedule, extras, overtime, proofs/finals, expenses,
mark complete, dispute, safety flag)

File upload + watermark previews; external link capture

Safety flag, block/r
