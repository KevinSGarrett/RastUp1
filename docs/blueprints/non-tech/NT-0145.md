 alert Finance; reprice none.

Payouts failing → freeze sends; display "payout delayed" in UI; retry
after root cause; notify sellers.

Search index degraded → fall back to cached results/top N; disable
advanced filters; rebuild offline.

Uploads S3/CDN issue → switch to reduced image sizes; queue video; show
"processing longer than usual."

Moderation classifier offline → enforce SFW blur defaults; premoderate
first N items; ramp back after checks.

Promotions overspend anomaly → immediate CPC cap; pause Featured; credit
wallet for overdelivery; rootcause invalid clicks.

Spam/abuse wave → tighten DM caps; block offplatform keywords;
autoquarantine new accounts; T&S mass actions.

Studio lockout spike → open city relocation list; goodwill credit
budget; contact affected bookings.

Feature flag misconfig → oneclick rollback to last known good; diff
viewer; require approver notes.

Data pipeline delay → show "partial" freshness banner; queue scheduled
reports; notify dashboard users.

Each runbook includes: owner, steps, rollback, comms template,
postincident checks.

H\) Change Management & Safeguards

Staged rollout for risky configs (1%→10%→50%→100%); autoabort on
guardrail breach (conversion, checkout, error rate).

Release freeze windows (city launches, holidays).

Preprod synthetic runs parallel to Prod.

Canaries: mirror 1--5% traffic.

Autorollback if error budget 1h burn exceeds threshold.

I\) Logging, Tracing & PII Hygiene

Structured logs with request_id, booking_id, city, role; no plaintext
PII (emails, phones, TINs) ever logged; use tokens only.

Distributed tracing across services; trace viewer limited to Admin
roles; sampling adjustable during incidents.

Retention: app logs 14--30 days; security/finance events 1--3 years (per
policy).

Access: masked views by default; unmask gated by §4.14.1 scopes +
reason.

J\) Backups, Recovery & Continuity

RPO/RTO targets: RPO ≤ 15 min, RTO ≤ 2 h for critical data stores.

Backups: pointintime for primary DB; object storage with lifecycle;
daily job integrity checks; quarterly restore drills.

Event replay: appendonly event bus; replay tools to rebuild search
indexes, counters, and derived aggregates.

External links manifest (deliverables): names/sizes/hashes enable
dispute handling even if thirdparty storage hiccups.

K\) Public Status Page & Comms

Components: API, Checkout, Payouts, Search, Uploads/Media, Promotions,
Tax Engine, Background Checks, Studio Deposits.

Incident workflow: draft → Legal quick review for S0 "wording" →
publish; cadence every 30--60 min; "resolved" with root cause summary
and next steps.

Subscribe: email/RSS.

Transparency guardrails: never include PII; keep copy SFW.

L\) Postmortems (Blameless)

Trigger: any S0, or S1 \> 30 min, or repeat S2 within 7 days.

Structure: what/impact/timeline/where we were blind/root cause(s)/what
helped/hurt/fixes/owners/dates; link to diffs & flags; attach
dashboards.

Action tracking: owners & due dates; reminders; escalation if overdue.

Learning loop: update runbooks/alerts/guardrails; review in weekly ops.

M\) Metrics & Alerts (Observability Program)

MTTD/MTTR (by severity), % incidents detected by monitors vs user
reports (target \> 80% monitors).

Error budget used per SLO; number of autorollbacks; changefailure rate;
paging fatigue (alerts/week/engineer).

Runbook coverage: incidents with matching runbook; time to first
mitigation.

Comms: time from declare → first status page update.

N\) Telemetry (Obs & Incidents)

obs.sli.update (name, value, slo_target) • obs.error_budget.burn

incident.declare (sev, ic, reason) • incident.page/ack/escalate

incident.status.update (public\|internal) • incident.resolve
