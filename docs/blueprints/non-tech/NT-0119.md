J\) Acceptance Criteria (mark 4.14.2 FINAL)

Typed Config Registry with scopes, precedence, validation, versioning,
and immutable history.

Feature Flags with targeting, staged rollout, and kill switches wired to
fallbacks.

Editable keys implemented for Fees, Refunds/Delivery, Travel,
Search/Ranking/Safe Mode, Promotions, Verification/Rep,
Support/Disputes, Tax, Messaging/Storage, Studios, City Perks.

Twoperson approvals enforced for sensitive keys; guardrails prevent
outofbounds settings.

Preview & simulation tools display impact on recent searches/bookings;
KPI thresholds gate publishes.

Scheduling & rollback operational; cache invalidation with pub/sub;
service snapshots bootsafe.

Observability dashboards + alerts for config publishes, drift, and
anomalies.

Telemetry events fired for edits, previews, publishes, reads, and
rollbacks.

K\) Example Playbooks (no code required)

Houston buyerfee holiday: set fees.buyer_pct=0.00 for city=HOU with end
date → publish staged → autorevert.

Tighten Safe Mode: raise classifier.threshold.preview to 0.85 for
state=TX after a spike; rollback if CTR drops \>5%.

Add travel fee band: append 25--50mi at \$60 for city=DAL; preview
geosim; publish.

Ranking tune: bump search.weights.rep_tiebreak from 1.0→1.2 in
HOU:model; A/B 50/50; evaluate conversion.

Deposit policy update: increase studio.deposit.cap_money to \$400 for
LA; schedule for tomorrow 09:00 local; rollback link armed.

Boost economics: lift promos.boosts.cpc_floor.city_role\[\"HOU:model\"\]
to \$1.00; monitor ROAS; revert if invalid clicks \>7%.

§4.14.3 --- Trust & Safety Ops

Goal: Prevent harm, respond fast, and preserve marketplace integrity.
Provide Ops with clear triage, evidencedriven decisions, proportionate
sanctions, and auditable outcomes---while protecting user privacy and
complying with policy and law.

A\) Scope & Inputs

What flows in:

Safety reports (from chat, booking, profile, studio)

Automated risk signals (rate limits, device anomalies, classifier flags)

Verification results (ID, Background, Social, Studio)

Content flags (handoff to §4.14.4 for final content actions)

Dispute escalations with safety context (handoff from §4.14.5)

Case types (examples):

P0: Imminent harm, threats, stalking, underduress, doxxing, sexual
coercion, child safety.

P1: Onprem access failures, harassment, boundary violations, unsafe
location, escorting/illegal solicitation.

P2: Misrepresentation (age/identity/portfolio), spam/scams, offplatform
payment steering, policy nudity violations (previews).

B\) SLAs & Queues

P0 queue: 15 min first response, 60 min mitigation target (freeze,
contact, takedown).

P1 queue: 30 min first response, 24 h resolution target.

P2 queue: 24 h first response, 72 h resolution target.

Queue view includes: severity chip, time since opened, linked
booking/thread, user roles, location (city), verification badges, prior
strikes, and live status (e.g., "IB suppressed," "payouts frozen").

C\) Triage & Intake (Agent Playbook)

Verify severity (P0/P1/P2) from report details; upgrade severity if
signals suggest escalation.

Is there an active/linked booking? Pull: SOW/House Rules, checkin/out
timestamps, areashare logs, studio rules, delivery manifest.

Preserve evidence (oneclick): chat transcripts, attachments, IP/device,
booking metadata, profile revisions → writeonce storage with hash
(chainofcustody).

Immediate controls (if needed):

Payout freeze (partial) on involved bookings.

IB suppression on reported party (auto for P0).

DM ratelimit for suspected spam.
