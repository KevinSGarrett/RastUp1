 purges.

Practical: redaction and manifests avoid duplicating huge media while
still producing what's required.

Safe by default: masking, leastprivilege, and twoperson approvals keep
sensitive actions controlled.

Lowcode ops: Legal drives routine compliance without engineering; only
edge cases need dev help.

§4.14.16 --- Sandbox & Training

Goal: Give every ops team a safe, realistic playground to learn,
rehearse, and validate workflows---without touching production or real
PII. Provide seeded demo data, simulators for external partners, guided
role training, incident drills, and QA/UAT tooling---with hard
isolation, audits, and oneclick resets.

A\) Scope, Roles & Guardrails

Who uses this: Support, Trust & Safety, City Ops, Finance/Tax, Studios
Ops, Content Moderation, Marketing/Ops, Product, Legal (training),
Readonly Auditors.

What it covers: Environment isolation, anonymized/procedural data,
seeders & scenario packs, fake gateways (payments/tax/ID/background),
webhook simulators, guided curricula, incident drills & chaos tests,
QA/UAT flows, resets & snapshots, reporting.

Guardrails:

No real PII ever enters Sandbox. Exports disabled; screenshots
watermarked "SANDBOX."

Separate SSO & RBAC realms (distinct login & MFA).

Feature flags & configs edited in Sandbox have no effect on Prod
(crossenv writes are blocked).

Network egress from Sandbox limited to simulators and allowlisted
endpoints.

B\) Environments & Isolation

DEV (for builders), SANDBOX (ops training & UAT), STAGE (preprod perf
tests), PROD.

Prominent environment banner + URL subdomain color coding.

Data segregation: unique databases, storage buckets, and API keys per
environment; killswitches default ON in Sandbox for moneymoving actions.

Email/SMS sink: all outbound comms land in a searchable "Message Inbox"
viewer (no real delivery).

C\) Data Strategy (synthetic + anonymized refresh)

Synthetic baseline: cityaccurate Houston cohort plus two satellite
cities; 90day booking history; realistic distributions for roles, Rep
Scores, prices, availability, and social metrics.

Anonymized refresh (optional): scheduled job builds fully anonymized
aggregates from Prod (counts, medians, distributions)---never raw PII.
Deterministic tokenization (formatpreserving) creates realistic but
nonreversible names/handles.

Media: stock & inhouse SFW sets with license to use for training;
thumbnails pregenerated.

Timemachine clock: freeze or advance Sandbox time (±30 days) to simulate
quarterend, 1099 runs, and filing windows.

D\) Seeders & Scenario Packs (oneclick load)

Seeders (idempotent): Users, service profiles, portfolios, studios
(verified/unverified), RFPs, bookings/LBGs, messages, deliverables
manifests, reviews, disputes, deposits, chargebacks, promos.

Scenario packs (choose role, city, difficulty):

Support: "Late delivery & partial refund" --- deliverables shortfall,
acceptance window, amended receipt flow.

T&S: "Boundary violation report" --- autosuppress IB, strike ladder,
neutral review handoff.

Finance: "Processor outage wave" --- bulk partial refunds, recon
variances, payouts delay comms.

Tax: "State X nexus on" --- enable state, category map tweak, calc
exceptions, filing calendar dryrun.

Moderation: "NSFW spike" --- classifier thresholds, blur/crop UI,
appeals triage.

Studios: "Lockout at arrival" --- code logs, relocation list, deposit
void.

Promotions: "ROAS slumps" --- floors tuning, QS weights A/B, makegood
credits.

City Ops: "Coverage gap" --- invites cohort, Founding perks, carousel
pin, Collab Day.

Legal: "Subpoena intake" --- hold creation, discovery workspace,
redacted production pack.

E\) Simulators & Fakes (external dependencies)

Payments Processor Sim: card success/decline matrices, 3DS challenge
emulator, ACH microdeposit flow, payout states (queued/sent/fail),
chargebacks lifecycle with webhook playback.

Tax Engine Sim: city/state rate tables with toggles for timeouts/errors;
"zerowhereexpected" edge cases; efile stubs f
