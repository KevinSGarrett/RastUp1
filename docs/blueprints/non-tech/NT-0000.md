Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) Index -- DO NOT CHANGE ID CODES

WBS-1: Core Product & Platform (technical implementation, SEO,
messaging, payments, admin, etc.)

WBS-2: City Launch & Go-To-Market (market research, city selection,
launch operations, marketing)

WBS-4: Talent Supply & Role Verticals (Models, Photographers,
Videographers, Content Creators / Influencers)\

SubSection 1.1 --- Role System Design

1\) Core Concept: "Linked Service Profiles" under One Account

One account per person (single login, single identity).

Each account can attach one or more "Service Profiles" (SP) --- one per
role:

Model SP

Photographer SP

Videographer SP

Content Creator SP

Each Service Profile is a self-contained, bookable offering with its
own:

Rolespecific fields (e.g., measurements vs. gear list)

Portfolio (images/videos assigned to that role)

Rates/packages & availability

Reviews & rating (per role)

Search index entry and URL

The Account has shared, global elements:

Display name, avatar, city/region, verification badges, background check
badge

Follower/following counts (global)

Unified inbox (roleaware threads)

Unified feed (posts can be tagged to one/more roles)

Favorites boards (can hold userlevel or rolelevel items)

Why: Treating each role as a distinct, bookable "Service Profile" makes
search and booking crystal clear while keeping life simple for multirole
users via one login and shared assets.

2\) URLs & Navigation

User overview: /u/{handle}\
Shows account header + tabs for each Service Profile (e.g., Model \|
Photographer \| Creator), global posts, and "About".

Service Profile canonical pages:

Model: /u/{handle}/model

Photographer: /u/{handle}/photographer

Videographer: /u/{handle}/videographer

Creator: /u/{handle}/creator

Search results always link to the rolespecific page (not the account
overview) to keep context tight.\
Example: From "Model" search, clicking Jane goes to /u/jane/model. From
there, users can switch roles via tabs ("Also offers: Photographer").

3\) Profile UI (What viewers see)

Header (shared)

Name, city, avatar, verification badges, backgroundcheck badge, overall
followers, quick actions (Message, Share, Report).

Role chips: Model \| Photographer \| Videographer \| Creator (active
role highlighted).

Tabs (roleaware, contextual default):

Work (role portfolio) --- grid/lightbox, role tags on media; NSFW gating
if applicable.

About (role fields) --- e.g., for Model: height, measurements,
hair/eyes, categories; for Photographer: specialties, gear, software;
for Creator: platform links, verified follower counts, engagement rate.

Rates & Packages --- hourly/day rates, packaged offers (e.g., "2hr
studio shoot w/ 10 edits").

Availability --- calendar, travel notes, response time.

Reviews --- rolespecific (default to the role you're viewing) with
toggle to view All Roles.

Posts --- profile feed; filter chips to display posts from this role by
default.

Primary CTA (contextual):

On role pages: "Book {Role}" and "Message about {Role}"

On overview: disabled until a role is selected (or show a small role
selector popover).
