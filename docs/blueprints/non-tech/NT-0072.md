tes we prioritize the following system evidence
(autoattached where available):

Checkin/out timestamps + geofence pass/fail.

House Rules & Property Release esign audit logs.

Access logs (door code release/time sent; if integrated).

Before/after photos (host; timestamped).

Overtime/overage indicators (End time vs booked End; crew count notes).

Calendar state at booking time (to counter "doublebooked" claims).

(For Talent deliverable disputes, continue using Delivery Room
manifests/autochecks as primary evidence.)

D\) Standard Outcomes (studiospecific)

Access failure (host fault): buyer full refund of studio; waive buyer
fee for that booking; goodwill credit allowed.

Amenity misrepresentation: cure if feasible (e.g., provide blackout
curtains), else partial refund aligned to value impact; repeat issues →
host strike.

Overtime/crew overage/rule violations: process via Postbooking
adjustment; approve with clear evidence; refund if host lacks evidence.

Damage claim: up to the deposit hold cap; see §H.

E\) SLAs & Timers (studiospecific)

Access issue (live) → P1 (≤ 30 min response; aim to resolve on the
spot).

Damage claim window: host must open ≤ 24h after checkout; buyer response
window 48h.

Adjustment window (overtime/overage): host opens ≤ 24h; buyer response
48h.

Neutral Review (if contested): decision target ≤ 5 business days.

F\) NoShow & Early Exit (studio)

Buyer noshow: apply Studio matrix (often 0% refund); deposit is not
captured unless damage/violation claimed.

Early exit: no prorata refunds unless host agrees; overtime may still
apply if late start pushes past booked end.

G\) Chargebacks (studio specifics)

Representment kit must include: checkin/out logs, rules/release
signatures, access log evidence, house rules, before/after photos, and
any approved adjustments.\
Deposit captures are separate charges; submit damage evidence with
capture receipt.

H\) Deposit Holds & Damage Claims (operational notes)

Authorize at checkout (or 24h prior, host setting); release
automatically 48h postcheckout if no claim.

On approved claim, capture partial/full up to cap; no platform fee on
captured amount (see §3.1 addendum).

Abuse guard: frequent denied claims reduce host visibility and may
remove deposit privileges.

I\) Knowledge Base (new/updated articles)

Add/refresh articles:

Studios 101: rules, access, deposits, cleaning fees, Instant Book vs
approval.

Attach a Studio to your shoot: how the inflow picker works; what "Linked
Booking Group" means.

Damage deposits & claims: timelines, evidence, how captures work.

Overtime & adjustments: what qualifies, how to dispute.

LBG refunds explained: examples showing different outcomes for Talent vs
Studio in one checkout.

All KB entries should link to corresponding policy matrices and timers
above.

J\) Agent Console (microtooling)

LBG outcome view: sidebyside (Talent \| Studio) with autocalc; one click
to apply both outcomes.

Deposit actions: authorize/void/capture with reason codes; evidence
viewer.

Templates: "Access failure (host remedy/credit)", "Adjustment
approved/denied", "Damage capture approved/denied".

Sanctions: toggle IB off for studio; reduce visibility; flag host for
quality review.

K\) Acceptance Criteria (mark §3.9 addendum FINAL)

New selfserve actions appear for Studio & LBG cases.

Studio matrix referenced & enforced; LBG summary surfaces perbooking
outcomes.

Evidence packs autoattach for Studio disputes (checkin/out, rules,
access, photos).

Deposit lifecycle supported in Support tooling (authorize/void/capture)
with audit logs.

Timers & SLAs implemented (24h/48h/5day) for claims/adjustments/neutral
review.

KB articles created/updated; links wired from help flows.

Agent console: LBG outcome view, deposit actions, message templates,
IB/visibility sanctions.

L\) Why this is "tiny" but necessary

It reuses §3.9 structure---just adds Studiospecific buttons, timers, and
evidence.

It keeps group bookings easy to explain and adjudicate:
