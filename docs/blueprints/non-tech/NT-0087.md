 supports Email/Apple/Google (+ optional SMS), return URLs, city

M\) Why this works

Fast to value: Buyers can send invites within a minute; sellers can
publish a bookable package in one sitting; hosts can list a studio with
clear expectations.

Low friction, high trust: Heavy checks are optional but clearly
rewarding (IB, DM credits, badges, Early Payout).

One account, many hats: Multirole + studio is natural, with simple
linking and context switching.

Measurable & tunable: Activation KPIs let us iterate quickly citybycity.

§4.4 --- Role Profiles (Public & Owner Views)

Goal: Make every role profile a hightrust, bookable storefront that's
easy to scan, easy to compare, and easy to manage---while keeping People
vs Places distinct, Safe Mode ON by default, and rolescoped reviews &
reputation. Support multirole accounts and optional studio linking
cleanly.
