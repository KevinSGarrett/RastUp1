O\) Acceptance Criteria (mark 4.14.13 FINAL)

Status cockpit with SLIs/SLOs, error budgets, dependency health, and
oneclick degradations/kill switches.

Alerting policy with severities, thresholds, paging & escalation;
editable via §4.14.2.

Incident workflow (IC assignment, roles, comms cadence, banners, status
page publishing).

Runbooks for top 12 scenarios; linked buttons in cockpit; tested
quarterly.

Change safeguards: staged rollout, guardrails, autorollback; freeze
windows.

PIIsafe logging & tracing with RBAC; retention policies applied.

Backups & restore drills meeting RPO/RTO; event replay tools.

Postmortems with action tracking; program metrics & quarterly review.

Telemetry events emitted; dashboards for MTTD/MTTR, alert volumes, error
budgets.

P\) Why this works

Find fast, fix fast: crisp SLOs and a cockpit that puts degradations and
runbooks one click away.

Safe by design: money/safety toggles require approvals; PII never leaks;
comms stay clear and SFW.

Continuous learning: postmortems feed runbooks and guardrails so
incidents trend down as the platform scales.

§4.14.14 --- Bulk Tools & Migrations

Goal: Give Ops/Support/Finance the power to make large, safe, reversible
changes---without code. Handle duplicates, reindexing, citywide policy
rollouts, mass refunds/credits, campaign adjustments, board/content
moves, and backfills with dryruns, guardrails, approvals, scheduling,
and audit trails. LBGaware, moneysafe, privacysafe.

A\) Scope, Roles & Guardrails

Who uses this: Super Admin (rare), Ops Leads, Support Leads, Finance,
City Ops, Trust & Safety (specific flows), Content Moderation (specific
flows), Readonly Auditor.

What it can change (entity families):

Users & Accounts (merge, role/profile reparenting, verification status
sync)

Bookings & LBGs (link/unlink legs, acceptance window extensions,
deliverables due date shifts)

Money Objects (bulk refunds/credits/fee adjustments with amended
receipts)

Promotions (boost/featured campaigns: pause/price floor align, budget
edits)

Search/Index & Social Metrics (reindex, backfill, recalc Rep, resync
social metrics)

Boards & Content (move/retag favorites, reassign tagged collaborators)

Studios (policy parameter updates: deposits, cleaning fees, min
durations)

Policy Attachments (SOW/release/House Rules addenda to future/affected
bookings)

Guardrails (always on):

Twoperson approval for money, safety, PIIsensitive, or irreversible
actions.

Dryrun + blastradius preview with sample rows required.

Chunked execution, idempotency keys, resume on failure.

Autogenerate rollback plan (where feasible) + snapshots.

Mask PII in previews; unmask gated by §4.14.1 scopes.

B\) Common Bulk Job Flow (wizard)

Select Operation → entity family + action (see sections below).

Define Target Set → filters (city, role, date range, status,
verification, Rep decile, campaign status, etc.) + optional CSV list
(IDs/emails).

DryRun & Preview → show count, 50row sample (before/after), impacted
KPIs (e.g., total refund \$), dependency checks (e.g., open disputes?).

Risk & Guardrails → flags needed (MoneyCritical, SafetyCritical), limits
(max \$/booking, max \$ total, max rows).

Schedule & Pace → start/end window (local city TZ), batch size,
interbatch delay, offpeak default.

Approvals → second approver with diff viewer.

Execute & Monitor → progress bar, perbatch logs, error bucket with
retry.

Notify (optional) → attach Smart Docs/Comms templates (§4.14.10) to
inform impacted users.

Rollback (if supported) → oneclick create inverse job template prefilled
from snapshot.

Job record includes: actor, reason code, linked ticket, scopes, filters,
dryrun snapshot hash, approvals, schedule, outcome stat
