Align terminology with Section 1 UI labels and Section 5 metrics
catalog; avoid synonyms that confuse staff.\
• When examples include numbers, ensure they reconcile to Section 3.1
fee math and Section 4.12 receipts.\
• Accessibility: all templates should be usable with keyboard‑only
navigation and screen readers.\
• Privacy: avoid embedding real PII in examples; use placeholders
consistently.\
• City‑gates: where content varies by city, call out the delta
explicitly and tie to the corresponding feature flag.\
• Training: every appendix should have a 1‑page executive summary and a
\'how to use this\' section for Support/Trust.\
• Change control: every material change requires an entry in the
changelog, owner sign‑off, and a Slack announcement to the relevant
channel.

• Keep this appendix version‑controlled; link to the controlling owner
and next review date.\

Purpose\
This appendix is a field‑level quick reference for analysts and
engineers. The authoritative schema lives in the warehouse (Section 5).
This guide summarizes Fact and Dimension tables, keys, privacy tags,
freshness, and common joins, so product and support can communicate
unambiguously.

B1. Naming, Keys & Privacy

Naming: snake_case for tables/columns. Facts store events/transactions;
Dimensions store entities/attributes.\
Keys: surrogate keys with id prefixes (user_id, booking_id). Foreign
keys explicit. Composite keys where necessary.\
Privacy tags: P0 (PII‑sensitive like TIN), P1 (contact), P2
(behavioral), P3 (public). Access controlled per §4.14.1.

B2. Core Dimensions

• \*\*user_dim\*\* --- User account and global settings.\
Fields: user_id (PK), created_at_ts, email_hash (P1), phone_hash (P1),
country_code, state_code, city, role_flags, idv_status,
trusted_pro_status, rep_overall_score, deletion_status

• \*\*service_profile_dim\*\* --- Role‑specific offerings.\
Fields: service_profile_id (PK), user_id (FK), role_type
(\'model\'\|\'photographer\'\|\'videographer\'\|\'creator\'), headline,
rate_min, rate_max, instant_book_enabled, nsfw_opt_in,
studio_verified_flag, rep_role_score

• \*\*location_dim\*\* --- Geo lookup.\
Fields: location_id (PK), city, state_code, lat, lng, metro_area,
timezone

• \*\*time_dim\*\* --- Calendar/time grain.\
Fields: time_id (PK), date, week, month, quarter, year, dow, hour

• \*\*studio_dim (beta)\*\* --- Studios/hosts.\
Fields: studio_id (PK), owner_user_id (FK), name, address_hash (P1),
verified_flag, deposit_default_amt, house_rules_version

B3. Core Facts (Events/Transactions)

• \*\*booking_fact\*\* --- One row per booking
request/acceptance/completion.\
Fields: booking_id (PK), buyer_user_id, provider_user_id,
service_profile_id, role_type, location_id, created_time_id, state
(\'requested\'\|\'accepted\'\|\'completed\'\|\'disputed\'\|\'canceled\'),
