Notes: All SPs inherit shared basics (bio, location), but require
rolespecific fields to be indexed for search.

5\) Search & Discovery (CategoryFirst)

Search begins by selecting a category (role): Models \| Photographers \|
Videographers \| Creators.

Home search bar has a leading role selector (defaults to last used).

Each role has its own advanced filters (different fields, operators, and
ranges).

Indexing: Each Service Profile is a separate search document.

A multirole user appears once per relevant role (e.g., "Jane --- Model"
and "Jane --- Photographer" are distinct cards).

Result Cards (rolescoped):

Avatar, name, city, role label, role rating (e.g., ★4.9 • 32), starting
rate, key highlights per role (Models: height/measurements; Creators:
followers/engagement; Photographers: specialties), verification badges.

Quick actions: Book, Message, Save to Board.

Subtext: "Also offers: Photographer" (clickable) --- but doesn't pollute
the current role results.

Saved searches & alerts are rolescoped (e.g., "Models in Houston, 5\'8+
fitness, \$\$/hour").

6\) Booking (RoleAnchored)

A booking is always tied to a Service Profile (the role being hired).

Request flow: Date/time, location, brief, deliverables, rate/packages;
optional contract terms (usage rights, model release template).

Calendar integration: One unified availability for the account; bookings
from any role block out time globally to prevent conflicts.

Rescheduling/cancellation apply to the rolebound booking, but time
blocking stays global.

7\) Reviews & Ratings (Clear & Fair)

Only bookers can review. One review per completed booking.

Rolespecific ratings:

Each Service Profile has its own star rating and review list.

On the account header (and in search cards), show perrole ratings if
they exist (e.g., "Model ★4.9 (32) \| Photographer ★4.6 (12)").

Overall rating (optional/secondary): A weighted composite (by \# of
reviews per role). Display lightly on the overview, never used in
rolespecific ranking.

Review visibility: Default to the role you're viewing with a toggle to
see All Roles (clearly labeled).

Why: Keeps feedback relevant to the service hired while still showing
crossrole reputation if desired.

8\) Messaging (Unified Inbox, RoleAware)

One inbox for the user, with smart organization:

Thread type: General Inquiry vs. Booking Thread #ID

Role context tag: e.g., Model, Photographer

Counterparty and project title/date

Status chips: New, Awaiting Reply, Payment Pending, Completed

Read receipts (✓ sent, ✓✓ read) with timestamps.

Filters & folders: By role, by status (Unread, Awaiting response), by
city/date.

Thread merge policy:

Each booking always gets its own thread.

Prebooking inquiries by role are separate threads per role (prevent
confusion).

The inbox shows conversation bundles by counterpart (expand to see
rolespecific threads).

Attachments: Mood boards, references, call sheets.

Safety: Inline tips for firsttime connections; easy report/block.

Incentives (ties to verification; see §12): base monthly newconversation
credits + bonus credits for verified tiers. Bookings and reply threads
do not consume credits.

9\) Portfolio & Tagging (Per Role, Easy to Maintain)

Media Library (account level): upload once, then assign media to one or
more roles (checks).

Role Portfolios: Each SP has Albums (e.g., "Editorial", "Fitness").
Media show role tags and collaborator tags.

Tagging collaborators: Add other users to media
