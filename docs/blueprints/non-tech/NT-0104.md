D\) Display & Surfacing

On profiles (People)

Star average + count (shows only after ≥ 3 verified reviews)

Reputation Ring (0--100) with "Why this score?" → breakdown and recent
trend sparkline

Latest reviews (3--5), with Verified booking label; studio reviews never
appear here

Community references in a separate section (low weight, ownerapproved)

On Studio pages

Star average + count (threshold ≥ 3)

Studio Reputation Ring (spacescoped) with breakdown (reliability
includes deposit claim behavior)

Photo reviews encouraged (SFW), especially of space and amenities

In Search

Rep ring chip on cards; hover/tooltip with score reason

Filters: Min Reputation (0--100) and Min Stars (1--5)

Sort: Top Reputation, Rating, and Recent

E\) Reputation Score (0--100) --- computation (v1)

Weights (roleaware; spaceaware for studios)

Reviews & volume --- 40% (Bayesiansmoothed star mean; more weight with
more reviews; community references capped)

Reliability --- 25% (ontime completion, noshow rate, cancel fault,
dispute loss rate; deposit abuse for studios)

Responsiveness --- 10% (median first response time; response
consistency)

Verifications --- 15% (ID, Trusted Pro, Socialverified, Verified Studio)

Recent performance --- 10% (last 90 days weighted 2×)

Penalties & decay

Late cancellations/noshows/dispute losses apply sharp penalties that
decay over 60--120 days.

Smallsample protection: Bayesian prior (city/role baseline) prevents
"100 after 1 review."

Caps: Any single factor can affect at most ±12 points per month
(prevents sudden swings).

New accounts: show "New --- building reputation" until 3 verified
reviews or 10 completed bookings.

Transparency

"Why this score?" panel shows 5 bars and examples ("2 late cancellations
in last 90 days (--6)").

"How to improve" checklist (e.g., Enable Instant Book; verify ID; reply
faster; meet delivery SLA).

F\) Antigaming & Moderation

Ring detection: repeated mutual 5★ bursts across a tight user cluster
(IP/device/time overlap) → flag; reduce weight; investigate.

Incentivized reviews: explicit quidproquo offers ("5★ for discount") are
prohibited; detection via text patterns + reports.

Review gating: Providers/hosts cannot prompt reviews with incentives
inthread; system handles prompts neutrally.

One owner response per review; edits allowed for 15 minutes after
posting, then locked (typos only).

Flagging: "Report review" (harassment, personal info, hate, explicit
content, irrelevant, privacy breach).

Outofscope: We don't remove reviews for mere opinion or star rating;
removal is for policy violations only.

Anonymity options: Buyers can publish under brand/team name; personal
names are hidden by default.

G\) LBG (Linked Booking Group) behavior

One postbooking flow invites the buyer to review both bookings (Talent &
Studio) in a single step; each publishes to its own page.

Reviews remain independent; a studio's issues don't lower a
photographer's rating (and vice versa).

If one booking is canceled by fault, the other may still be reviewable
per its own rules.

H\) Safety Feedback (private, nonpublic)

Structured form in the review flow: boundary violations, harassment,
unsafe space, undisclosed cameras, access issues.

Feeds Safety Console with the booking context, checkin/out, docs, and
message snippets.
