allowlists prevent accidental national exposure. Admin has kill‑switches
for money and safety features with two‑person approval.\
• Admin Operability: No checklist is \'done\' unless Support can resolve
the top 3 edge cases without engineering and Trust can perform required
actions with an audit trail.\
• Help‑Center Alignment: All user‑facing copy is mirrored in the help
center with last‑updated dates and visual examples. We avoid legal
jargon; we explain outcomes and next steps.\
• QA Strategy: We prefer production‑like staging with seeded data and
synthetic bookings. We test under simulated load, outage, and edge cases
(ACH returns, 3DS failures, moderation queue spikes).\
• Holdouts & Experiments: Promotions, ranking, and any economic nudges
run with control cells and pre‑registered guardrails. We pause
experiments when guardrails breach.\
• Close‑the‑Loop: Post‑launch, we hold 7/30/90‑day reviews that tie
metrics to actions and retire ineffective steps.

Operational Disclaimer: This playbook bundle is an internal execution
guide. It is not a public policy document. Where compliance or legal
actions are required, consult Section 8 and counsel. Where money flows
change, consult Sections 3 and 4.

Context & Alignment: Our launch approach is city‑by‑city with nationwide
signups allowed, starting in Houston. We launch subscription‑free,
monetize through take‑rate and usage‑based promotions with strict
eligibility and caps, and keep public media within an artistic‑only
boundary with Safe‑Mode defaults for guests. Deliverables are handled
via external links (Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests. Instant
Book requires ID verification; background checks are opt‑in (Trusted
Pro). Payments include card (3DS when required) and ACH (with a reduced
buyer fee). Feature flags and city gates control blast radius, and the
Admin Console enables Support, Trust, Finance, and Ops to act without
code changes.

Goals:\
• Prove money moves correctly before opening the floodgates.\
• Keep contingency playbooks for processor or tax engine incidents.\
• Ensure receipts, payouts, and reconciliations are audit‑ready.

Processor Readiness:\
□ Card: auth, capture, partial refund, full refund, dispute webhook; 3DS
challenge test; card update flows.\
□ ACH: link, micro‑deposit fallback, return codes, buyer fee reduction,
retry logic.\
□ Payouts: bank connect, reserve holds, Early Payout per‑use, failed
payout retry.

Tax Engine Readiness:\
□ Quotes by state allowlist; latency SLO met; credit memos for refunds;
outage banner fallback.\
□ Receipts: itemized tax per leg; deposit auth not taxed; captured
deposit taxed as required.

Reconciliation:\
□ Daily close: match processor settlements; promotions wallet charges;
tax exports; variance alarms.\
□ Admin tools: amended receipts; ledger views; chargeback kit templates.

Owners & Roles:\
• Finance lead --- reconciliation and receipts.\
• Payments PM/Eng --- processor integration and webhooks.\
• Tax PM --- engine configuration and allowlists.\
• Support --- money macros; dispute intake.

Instrumentation & Readiness Signals:\
• Checkout success rate; tax quote success/latency; payout latency;
settlement variance; chargeback win rate.\
• ACH adoption and effect on buyer fee vs processor cost.

Top Risks & Mitigations:\
• Processor outage → ACH/card fallback; queue and retry; disable promos
if needed to protect performance.\
• Tax miscalculation → disable tax in affected state via allowlist;
message users; reconcile nightly.

Acceptance Criteria (Go/No‑Go):\
✓ 14 consecutive days of green daily close; variance within tolerance.\
✓ End‑to‑end test scenarios pass for both legs (talent and studio when
enabled).\
✓ Chargeback kit demonstrably complete; templates published.
