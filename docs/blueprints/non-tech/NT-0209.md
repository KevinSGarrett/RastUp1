es, cadences, and guardrails, we risk
stalled growth, policy drift, and support backlogs.

Operating principles:\
• Split teams by value stream (discovery/booking, money/tax,
trust/safety, promotions/growth, studios) rather than by technical
layer.\
• Treat admin and analytics surfaces as first‑class product; if support
cannot resolve an edge case without code, the feature is not done.\
• Ship behind flags; prefer reversible decisions; use city gates for
higher‑risk launches.\
• Everything that touches safety or money produces an audit trail and
measurable outcomes.

Operational themes & responsibilities:\
• Phased adds: FE/BE for Core App; BE for Money/Tax; BE for Promotions;
SRE after Beta; Ops hires for Support & T&S.\
• Budget guardrails: infra+data ≤ 15% GMV; CAC budgets tied to city
KPIs.

Processes & cadences:\
• Weekly business review: KPIs, incidents, error budgets, experiments,
city gating decisions.\
• Squad rituals: daily standups, mid‑week demos behind flags, Friday
retros; shared ship log.\
• Risk review: T&S, Finance, and Legal sign‑off for changes that alter
policy, money movement, or public content rules.\
• Post‑incident reviews: timelines, user impact, root causes,
code/config changes, owner, and follow‑ups.

Success metrics:\
• Burn multiple \< plan; hiring velocity meets targets; support FRT/FRR
in SLA; engineering operating time ≤ 30%.

Top risks & mitigations:\
• Hiring ahead of need; over‑rotation on contractors; hidden spend in
data/infra; untracked CAC in founding cities.

Launch checklist (acceptance):\
□ Headcount plan approved quarterly; offer templates ready; recruiting
pipeline metrics reported weekly.

Deep dive: Case study --- Houston Alpha: How the team used feature flags
and admin tools to run a safe Instant Book pilot without code changes
mid‑flight.\
We document the detection signals, the decision tree, the admin actions
available, and the roll‑forward/roll‑back conditions. Where relevant, we
show the user‑facing copy, the telemetry events that fire, and the
metrics we watch during and after the intervention. Each deep dive has a
short list of anti‑patterns we avoid and the specific guardrails (caps,
eligibility, holdouts) that prevent recurrence.

Deep dive: Scenario --- ACH returns spike: How Finance and Support
coordinate, which macros they use, and how the buyer‑fee discount copy
changes temporarily.\
We document the detection signals, the decision tree, the admin actions
available, and the roll‑forward/roll‑back conditions. Where relevant, we

Deep dive: Scenario --- Promotions abuse attempt: How invalid‑click
detection works, how credits are auto‑applied, and when Trust pauses
paid delivery for an account.\

available, and the roll‑forward/roll‑back conditions. Where relevant, we

Deep dive: Scenario --- Background check adverse action: FCRA steps,
Smart Docs templates, notice timing, and how the reputation score decays
and recovers.\
