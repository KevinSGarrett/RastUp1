nths or on risk events.

Tier 2 --- Background Check ("Trusted Pro", optional; passthrough
priced)

Triggers: optin for Trusted Pro badge; required for certain sensitive
categories if ever added.

Method: SSN trace, national criminal/sexoffender, sanctions; countylevel
where indicated by vendor logic.

Unlocks: Trusted Pro badge, provider fee --0.5% (see §3.1), RFP
priority, onetime \$15 Boost coupon.

Refresh: 12 months or on risk events; FCRAstyle adverse action + appeal
flow.

Tier 3 --- Studio Verification (optional; "Lite" first)

When: user wants a Studio Verified badge or frequently sets their own
space as the shoot location.

Lite (MVP, automationheavy): address claim + one supporting doc
(lease/utility/biz registration) → OCR + name/address match +
geocode/Place lookup → autoapprove if match confidence high; manual
review only on fails.

Full (defer to Phase 2): optional remote video walkthrough or thirdparty
inspection for highvolume venues.

Unlocks: Studio Verified badge; search filter "Studio access: verified";
fastpath location selection at checkout.

Social Verification (optional, free)

OAuth to IG/YT/TT/X; nightly sync metrics → verified chips and
perplatform search filters (see §1.2 addendum).

Age/NSFW Eligibility (derived)

Age derived from Tier 1; enables artisticnudity portfolios per policy
(mainstreamfirst stance).

C\) Flows & UX (keep it fast, clear, recoverable)

2minute ID flow target; progress meter; "Why you're seeing this"
explainer tied to the trigger (e.g., "Needed to release payouts").

Grace periods: If a trigger occurs midconversation, allow user to finish
current action and prompt verification before the next gated action.

Failure recovery: clear reason category + retake guidance; escalate to
manual only after 2 failed attempts.

No hard walls at signup: users can browse, build profile/portfolio, and
message within free limits before any KYC.

D\) Cost & Monetization Posture (launch → scale)

Who pays (launch):

ID (Tier 1): Platformpaid (subsidized) in founding cities.

Background (Tier 2): Passthrough pricing; we may add a small coupon to
encourage early adoption.

Studio Lite (Tier 3): Platformpaid doc review for first 200
studios/city; then \$19 docreview fee (waived by promo when needed).

Social OAuth: free.

Budget guardrails (Ops/Finance):

Set a monthly KYC budget cap per city (e.g., \$750--\$1,500),
autothrottle subsidies if exceeded (e.g., defer nonurgent Tier 1 until
payout trigger).

Track cost per verified and cost per incremental booking uplift; keep
CAC efficient.

Future levers (only postliquidity):

Optional expedited verification (24h fast lane) for a small fee.

Bundles (ID + BG) with modest margin only if conversion lift is proven
and churn impact is nil.

E\) Automation & Ops Model (devlight, scalable)

Vendors: one KYC SDK (ID + liveness), one BG vendor, geocode/Place API
for Studio Lite.

Manualexception queue: target \<10% of ID attempts; SLAs: ID \< 24h
(exceptions), BG ≤ 48h (county delays may vary), Studio Lite \< 24h for
failed automatches.

Staffing (pilot): 1 parttime reviewer per \~500--700 monthly
verifications (exceptions only).

Dashboards: pass/fail rates, exception volume, completion time, dropoff
at each step, cost per check, conversion lift vs. unverified.

F\) Data Handling & Compliance

We store: status (Pass/Fail/Needs info), reason codes, timestamp, vendor
ID; no raw ID images/biometrics.

Retention: verification attestations 24 months or until account
deletion; honor legal holds.

Consent: explicit consent screens; link to privacy, biometric notices
where applicable.

FCRA/EEOC: preadverse + adverse action for BG denials; individualized
assessment; appeal path.

Nondiscrimination: no targeting by protected class; policy + audits.

Marketplace role: verification conveys eligibility, not employment or
moral certification.

G\) Studio Verification --- MVP (what we do now vs later)

Do now (Lite): doc OCR + name/address match + geocode/Place check;
