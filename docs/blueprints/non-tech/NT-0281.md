asks without code changes.

Goals:\
• Rely on a tax engine for jurisdiction determination and rate
calculation; avoid hard‑coding volatile rules.\
• Document when we act as collector vs when the provider does, based on
service type and state posture.\
• Ensure receipts and exports itemize tax correctly; support amendments
and refunds.

Scope & Applicability:\
Applies to taxable services and fees in the United States where state or
local law imposes sales or similar transaction taxes. At launch we rely
on a tax engine configured for US‑only; coverage expands city‑by‑city
per §6.3.

Definitions (plain language):\
• Marketplace facilitator: a platform obligated in some jurisdictions to
collect/ remit tax on third‑party sales.\
• Taxable base: the portion of the transaction subject to tax (service,
fees, deposits if captured).\
• Sourcing: origin‑based vs destination‑based rules for services;
determined by the engine using addresses.

Policy Statements:\
• Engine‑first policy: we use tax provider quotes at checkout and store
a tax transaction id; we do not invent rates.\
• Role mapping: talent services vs studio rentals may be taxed
differently; we configure item categories accordingly.\
• Receipts: show tax lines by leg; deposit auth not taxed; captured
deposits taxed if jurisdiction requires.\
• Refunds & amendments: credit memos issued through the engine; partial
refunds adjust tax proportionally.\
• Allowlist rollout: only enable tax in states we have configured and
tested; show banner where tax is not yet collected.

Procedures & Operational Playbooks:\
• Admin tax map: city/state allowlist; category mapping; override flags
when the engine is down.\
• Nightly reconciliation: totals by jurisdiction; exception report for
missing tax ids; SLA checks for latency.

Enforcement & Remedies:\
• Outcomes: tax collected & remitted via engine; tax not applicable; or
pending due to outage (with user banner).\
• Mis‑classification: fix mapping; issue adjustments; document in
reconciliation logs.

Data, Privacy & Retention:\
• PII minimization: addresses and TINs stored in vault; tax data limited
to what is required; logs scrubbed.\
• Retention: export archives per finance schedule; legal holds paused
when necessary.

Templates & Required Notices (internal/external):\
• Templates: tax‑enabled banner copy; \'tax not collected yet in your
state\' banner; reconciliation playbook; outage copy.\
• Help‑center: \'How taxes work,\' \'Why was tax charged?,\' \'Which
services are taxed?\'

Compliance Metrics & Audits:\
• Tax latency; quote success rate; reconciliation variance; number of
overrides; user contacts about tax confusion.

Risks & Mitigations:\
• Volatile rules → centralize in engine; avoid bespoke logic in app;
maintain a small allowlist for coverage.\
• User confusion → show simple copy and itemized receipts; link to help
center; keep support macros ready.

Acceptance Checklist (ready to externalize):\
□ Engine configured; allowlist published; receipts itemize correctly;
nightly reconciliation and exports passing for 30 days.

Deep Dive: Scenario --- Unsafe off‑platform interaction: intake,
escalation, and law‑enforcement coordination.\
We capture intake checklists, decision trees, and user messaging; list
admin actions; define audit fields; and annotate guardrails. We avoid
legal conclusions in user‑facing copy and defer to counsel where
necessary, while keeping product/ops steps executable.
