on, discovery workspace,
redacted production pack.

E\) Simulators & Fakes (external dependencies)

Payments Processor Sim: card success/decline matrices, 3DS challenge
emulator, ACH microdeposit flow, payout states (queued/sent/fail),
chargebacks lifecycle with webhook playback.

Tax Engine Sim: city/state rate tables with toggles for timeouts/errors;
"zerowhereexpected" edge cases; efile stubs for 1099 runs.

ID/Background Sim: pass/fail with reason codes; throttling/bulk delays;
FCRA "adverse action" stub.

Content Scan Sim: NSFW classifier bands, OCR PII hits, virus flags.

Notifications Sim: email/SMS/web push sink with opens/clicks.

Maps/Geo Sim: distance & travel fee calculator; studio geocode
anomalies.

Social Metrics Sim: IG/TT/YT/X connectors return tokenized counts,
growth, and ratelimit errors.

Each simulator exposes: dashboard, force state switch, and replay last N
webhooks.

F\) Training Modes & Curricula

Role tracks: Support, T&S, Finance/Tax, City Ops, Studios Ops,
Moderation, Promotions/Ops, Legal.

Guided checklists inside the Admin UI: stepbystep tasks with
autovalidation ("Issue partial refund → amended receipt generated →
totals match calculator").

Inline coach marks & hint videos (60--120s) per task.

Autograding: pass/fail with explanations; require retry when policy
violated.

Certifications: "Sandbox Certified --- Support L1/L2", "T&S L1", etc.;
expire annually; printable PDF badges.

Practice datasets rotate monthly to prevent memorization.

G\) Incident Drills & Chaos Kits

Drill runner: schedule P0/P1 simulations (card processor outage, tax
engine down, promotions overspend).

Chaos toggles: inject latency, error spikes, partial dependency failures
(e.g., 20% payout API errors).

Scoring: MTTD/MTTR, correct use of degradations & runbooks, comms
timing, and adherence to guardrails (twoperson approvals).

Afteraction: autocompiled report; add action items to Observability
postmortem tracker (§4.14.13).

H\) QA & UAT Workflows (nocode)

Flag preview: flip §4.14.2 feature flags safely; simulate staged
rollouts and guardrail aborts.

Docs CMS UAT: assemble SOW/House Rules/releases; esign with fake
signers; pinned versions on fake bookings; PDF render checks.

Promotions UAT: CPC floors and QS weights simulations on a mirror of
last 7 days' synthetic queries.

Bulk Tools UAT: dryrun mass refunds, merges, and reindexes; verify
impact tiles and rollback templates.

Tax UAT: 1099 dryruns with edelivery consent flows; Efile stub returns
filing IDs.

Search & Ranking UAT: compare ranking diffs after rep formula/weight
changes on seeded data.

I\) Resets, Snapshots & Access Windows

Snapshot & restore: nightly baseline + manual snapshots preUAT; restore
in \<15 min.

Oneclick "clean room": wipe personal training footprints
(cases/messages) but keep seeds.

Access windows: training cohorts get timeboxed access; automatic disable
after window.

J\) Guardrails & Safety

Watermarks on every page; copy/paste of IDs adds "SANDBOX" suffix to
prevent misuse.

Downloads limited; CSVs watermarked; large exports blocked.

Money actions are virtual; Sandbox ledger kept separate; no external
funds ever move.

PII masks enforced; unmask buttons removed in Sandbox.

K\) Reporting & KPIs

Training completion rate by role/cohort; firstattempt pass %;
timetocertification.

Drill coverage: \# of drills/quarter; average MTTD/MTTR (Sandbox);
runbook adherence.

UAT throughput: \# of UAT sessions, issues found before Prod, rollback
rate reduction postUAT.

Simulator usage: webhooks replayed, failure modes exercised.
