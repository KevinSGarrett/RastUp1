F\) AutoChecks & Evidence (objective validation)

On upload or link attach:

Technical:

Images: resolution (≥ target px), color space (sRGB/Adobe RGB), aspect
ratio, file type, filesize, EXIF presence.

Video: container/codec (MP4/H.264 or ProRes proxy), resolution, fps,
audio channels, duration.

Integrity: virus scan; checksum recorded (SHA256) for proofs/finals (and
for external manifests when possible).

Policy guards: NSFW detection warning (so sellers avoid borderline
public previews); SafeMode validation on previews.

Link checks: provider type (Drive/Dropbox/OneDrive/S3), reachability,
headers (size/type), and expiry status.

Evidence pack: autocollects manifest, checks, and timestamps; used in
disputes.

G\) Revisions & Comments

Revision rounds: default 1 round (configurable per package); seller can
grant extras inthread.

Peritem comments (images); timecoded comments (video); resolve state for
each comment.

Change requests must be actionable (UI enforces structured notes: crop,
color, retouch notes, timecode ranges).

Timers: buyer must submit revision request within the acceptance window;
seller SLA per package (e.g., 3 business days).

H\) Downloads & Watermarks

Proofs: watermarked, previewonly (download toggle off by default).

Finals: download links visible immediately on publish, or after
acceptance (package option).

External originals: always via provider's storage
(Drive/Dropbox/OneDrive/S3/S3 presigned); we never host originals.

Retention: onplatform proxies kept 90 days; manifests retained 12--24
months; banner clarifies "Not a backup service."

I\) Acceptance, Autoaccept & Payout Triggers

Acceptance window: default 7 days (3/7/14 options).

Manual Accept: buyer can accept itemlevel or whole batch; license
certificate issues instantly.

Autoaccept: when timer ends without open revision; licenses issue
automatically; payout queues.

Partial acceptance: allowed; payout apportions across accepted items if
package contracted peritem pricing; otherwise paid on batch acceptance.

UGC/Promo: acceptance on verify + minlive; payout scheduled afterwards.

Early Payout (peruse): eligible sellers (Rep ≥ 85) can accelerate
postacceptance.

J\) Disputes & NonDelivery

Missing deliverables (seller uploaded fewer than contracted): buyer
opens Refund Request; system compares contracted vs manifest; partial
refunds computed.

Quality disputes (offspec): rely on Autochecks + SOW to determine
deviation; may provide partial refund or revision credit.

Expired external links: seller must refresh within 48h of buyer notice;
timers pause during refresh grace; repeated expiry → reputation hit.

Escalation to Neutral Review (per §3.9): evidence pack includes
manifest, checks, comments, timestamps, link status, and SOW terms.

Studios: route to studio deposit/adjustment flows (no file disputes).

K\) Security, Privacy & Policy

Virus scanning on all uploads; block executables; safe MIME validation.

EXIF privacy: warn on personal EXIF; provide "strip on proxy" option.

DMCA & IP: report flow; lock downloads when claim is open; notify both
parties.

Safe Mode: only SFW previews visible publicly; buyer & seller see full
content subject to policy; FanSub flows avoid explicit previews.

L\) UI Details (components & states)

ManifestList with status chips: Proof • Final • Needs action • Error •
Link expired.

AutoCheckStatus: green/yellow/red with tooltips (e.g., "Video exceeds
4GB proxy limit; original link captured").

Comment sidebar (per item) with timecodes & resolve checkboxes.

Timer banner: shows Acceptance ends in Xd Xh; pauses if revision round
is open.

License chip on each Final; View License opens certificate modal (terms,
project, booking ID).

UGC tracker: "Verifying post..." → "Live ✓ (48/72h remaining)" →
"Verified ✓".

M\) Notifications & Emails

Seller: "Buyer selected X proofs" • "Revision requested on N items" •
"Acceptance complete"
