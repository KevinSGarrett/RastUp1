§9.8 --- KPI Dashboard for Board Updates (Definitions & Sources)

Financial Modeling Disclaimer: This section provides planning
assumptions, formulas, and structures for internal modeling. It is not a
forecast or financial advice. All sample numbers are illustrative;
replace with real inputs once telemetry in §5 is live.

Context & Alignment: We operate a US‑only creative marketplace
connecting models, photographers, videographers, and content creators
with buyers and studios. Launch strategy is subscription‑free;
monetization is via take‑rate on bookings and usage‑based promotions
(capped, labeled, eligibility‑gated). Public content is artistic‑only;
deliverables use external storage with immutable manifests. Instant Book
requires ID verification; background checks are opt‑in (Trusted Pro).
ACH reduces buyer fee to 3% where enabled. Feature flags and city gates
control rollout; admin tools and audits turn policy into software.

Goals:\
• Define the board‑level KPIs, their exact formulas, and their data
sources so updates are consistent.\
• Ensure every KPI is explainable and tied to controllable levers.\
• Standardize red/yellow/green thresholds with owners.

Key variables & baselines:\
• KPI families: Liquidity (S→I, I→B), Growth (active buyers/providers),
Economics (GMV, take‑rate, margin), Trust (IDV %, safety), Payments (ACH
share, payout latency), Promotions (adoption, ROAS), Support (FRT,
FRR).\
• Sources: Gold tables from §5.5; event schemas from §5.1; freshness
SLOs from §5.12; admin actions from §4.14.\*.

Core formulas (structure; plug real telemetry later):\
• S→I = Inquiries / Searches (eligible)\
• I→B = Bookings / Inquiries (eligible)\
• GMV = Σ booking subtotals (completed legs)\
• Take‑rate = (ProviderFee + BuyerFee + Promotions − ProcessorCOGS) /
GMV\
• ROAS (promotions) = Incremental GMV × TakeRate / PromotionsSpend\
• CAC_blended = TotalMarketingSpend / NewActiveBuyers (or providers)

Explainability:\
We show source events, denominators, and example calculations. For ROAS,
we use holdout incrementality---not naive last‑touch attribution.

Thresholds:\
Red/yellow/green bands are set from §6 targets. Thresholds are reviewed
quarterly and ratcheted only after sustained performance.

Presentation:\
Board deck uses consistent tiles with spark lines, YoY/period deltas,
and short \'what moved\' memos per owner.

Instrumentation & success metrics:\
• KPI tile freshness (hours since last update); error budget burn;
number of data quality exceptions\
• Owner list with backups; on‑call data steward for board week

Top risks & mitigations:\
• Metric drift → lock definitions with a ledger; require changelog and
approver for edits\
• Gaming → monitor for anomalies; tie incentives to a basket of KPIs,
not a single metric

Acceptance checklist:\
□ Dashboard ready by T‑5 business days before board; freeze window
enforced.\
□ Single‑page appendix lists formulas and sources; DQ report attached.\
□ Owners sign off on their tiles with short narratives.

Modeling Deep‑Dive:\
• Scenario setup: Define a city cohort with starting supply and demand,
apply search→inquiry and inquiry→booking rates from §6.2/§6.3, then
layer on cancellations, lateness, and chargebacks. Compute GMV per
cohort and pass it through fee structure, taxes, and processor costs.\
• Unit economics: For a representative \$X booking, compute provider fee
(12%), buyer fee (5% or 3% with ACH), and processing cost. Show platform
net before variable ops (content safety scans, IDV/BG subsidies). Repeat
for small (≤\$150), mid (\$300--\$600), and large (\>\$1,000) bookings.\
• Promotions ROI: Using holdouts, estimate incremental GMV from paid
exposure. Attribute revenue to promotions net of invalid‑click credits.
Ensure quality score and eligibility keep paid from cannibalizing
organic relevance.\
