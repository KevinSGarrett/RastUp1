C\) Health Cockpit (Admin → Observability)

Status board tiles: API, Search, Checkout (Card/ACH), Escrow, Payouts,
Promotions, Uploads/Moderation, Tax Engine, Background Check, Studio
Deposits, Messaging, Notifications.\
Each tile shows current SLI/SLO, trend sparkline, errorbudget burn, and
degrade/kill buttons (where safe).\
Dependency pane: external provider status ingest; shows current
incidents & ETA.

Synthetic monitors:

Buyer path: search → profile → add to cart → checkout (card/ACH) →
receipt.

Seller path: accept → deliverables upload → acceptance.

Studio path: calendar → checkout with deposit hold.\
Runs per city (Houston focus + 3 canaries) every minute.

D\) Alerting Policy & Paging

Severities

S0 (P0): Platformwide checkout failure, data loss risk, security breach
→ page immediately (phone/SMS/Slack) to OnCall + Incident Commander
(IC).

S1 (P1): Degraded key flow in any city (e.g., Houston), payout stall,
tax calc outage, promotions overspend → page OnCall.

S2: Elevated error or latency with autoretries; backlog growth; single
dependency degraded → Slack alert to channel; acknowledge within 30 min.

S3: Nonurgent anomalies & dataquality drifts → daily digest.

Threshold examples (editable in §4.14.2):

Checkout success \< 98.5% 10min window (S1); \< 95% 5min (S0).

Tax exceptions \> 2% 15min (S1).

Payout failures \> 1% 30min (S1).

Promotions spend pacing \> +10% houroverhour (S1).

Upload backlog \> 5k or scan p95 \> 120s (S2).

Escalation: IC assigns Ops Lead, Comms/Scribe, and Resolver; if no ack
in 5 min, escalate to secondary.

E\) Incident Lifecycle (declare → close)

Detect (monitor or report) → Declare severity & IC in the tool.

Stabilize: apply degradation/kill switches (see G), raise banners, slow
traffic if needed, open support macro.

Communicate: internal incident room; post to public status page if
S0/S1; cadence every 30--60 min until resolved.

Mitigate & validate: rollbacks, feature flag flips, traffic shifting,
provider fallback.

Resolve: all SLIs normal; remove banners; undegrade; mark "Resolved".

Postmortem: within 5 business days---blameless, action items with
owners/deadlines.

Comms templates (from §4.14.10): internal alert, stakeholder update,
public status page incident, "all clear."

F\) Degradations & Kill Switches (oneclick)

Degrade (preferred) before kill: keeps core value flowing.

Checkout: disable ACH (fallback to card; buyer fee reverts to 5%);
disable multileg/LBG (separate flows) if grouping breaks.

Promotions: pause Featured, keep CPC with stricter caps; or pause all
paid Boosts.

Tax: grace mode---block checkout with clear retry banner (failclosed for
money safety) or delay acceptance with "tax pending" flag (adminapproved
only).

Uploads: switch to queueonly (no preview generation) and lengthen
moderation SLA; throttle size per file.

Payouts: enqueue only, delay send with banner; communicate ETAs to
sellers.

Background checks: switch to IDonly gating temporarily; queue requests.

Studio deposits: disable new auths (fallback to cleaning fee) if PSP
deposit path fails.

Kill switches (hard off; see §4.14.2): Instant Book, Promotions, LBG,
ACH, Deposits, Safe Mode stricton. All require reason + twoperson
approval for money/safety.

G\) Runbooks (top 12)

Card processor incident → route to fallback region; if full outage:
block checkout with banner; open S0; ACH off; autoretry queue.

ACH/Bank link outage → kill ACH; buyer fee back to 5%; announce;
reenable when synthetic passes 30 min.

Tax engine down → enable tax grace mode; hold checkouts or delay
acceptance (policy); alert Finance; reprice none.

Payouts failing → freeze sends; display "payout delayed" in UI; retry
after root cause; notify sellers.

Search index degraded → fall back to cached results/top N; disable
advanced filters; rebuild offline.

Uploads S3/CDN issue → switch to reduced image sizes; queue video; show
"processing longer than usual."

Moderation classifier offline → enforce SFW blur default
