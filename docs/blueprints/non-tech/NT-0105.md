n't lower a
photographer's rating (and vice versa).

If one booking is canceled by fault, the other may still be reviewable
per its own rules.

H\) Safety Feedback (private, nonpublic)

Structured form in the review flow: boundary violations, harassment,
unsafe space, undisclosed cameras, access issues.

Feeds Safety Console with the booking context, checkin/out, docs, and
message snippets.

Not public; may trigger a strike, IB suppression, or verification
recheck; submitter receives outcome summary when resolved.

I\) Prompting & Emails (biasfree)

Neutral subject lines and copy ("Share feedback about your experience").

No starnudging language; no images that could bias; SFW only.

Onetap stars deeplink on mobile; text field optional except for 1--2★
(reason required).

Followup once if unreviewed; no further nags after day 14.

J\) Metrics & Health Targets

Review completion rate ≥ 55% (either side)

Doubleblind submissions ≥ 35% (both sides submitted before day 14)

1--2★ share within expected band (watch for chilling effects)

Disputeadjusted satisfaction (4★+ after successful support outcome)

Flag rate \< 2% of reviews; removal rate \< 0.4% (policy violations
only)

Rep score stability (stdev \< 6 points over 30 days for steady accounts)

Correlation: Rep vs conversion uplift (target positive, diminishing
returns past \~85)

K\) Telemetry

review.request.sent/open • review.submit (stars, role\|studio) •
review.publish

review.flag (reason) • review.owner_response.submit

L\) Acceptance Criteria (mark 4.10 FINAL)

Doubleblind reviews with a 14day window; publish when both submit or on
expiry.

Rolescoped reviews & reputation for People; spacescoped for Studios;
never mixed.

Composer includes stars, tags, optional text, SFW photos, and private
safety feedback.

Display: profiles/pages show star average (≥3 reviews), latest reviews,
Reputation Ring with transparent breakdown.

Reputation Score computed with weights (40/25/10/15/10), Bayesian
smoothing, penalties with decay, caps on monthtomonth swing, and "New"
state until minimum data.

Search integrates Rep ring chips, filters (Min Rep/Min Stars), and sort
options.

Antigaming rules enforced: ring detection, no incentives, policybased
removals only; owner reply limits.

LBG review bundle flow implemented; each review publishes to its own
entity.

Safe Mode respected: no explicit media in reviews; emails/push SFW.

Telemetry & KPIs instrumented as listed.

M\) Why this works

Trustworthy by design: Only verified bookings yield public reviews; the
rest factor into reliability quietly.

Explainable, not mysterious: The 0--100 score with a clear "why" builds
confidence and guides improvement.

Hard to game, easy to use: Doubleblind timing, smallsample smoothing,
and ring detection keep ratings honest; the UI stays friendly.

Aligns with search & conversions: Strong reputation helps sort ties
without letting paid boosts hijack results.

§4.11 --- Support, Refunds & Disputes UX

Goal: Resolve issues quickly, predictably, and fairly with minimal human
touch. Keep everything policyaware, evidencefirst, LBGaware (Talent +
Studio), and feeaccurate (per §3.1). Make outcomes clear before users
commit to a request, and autoassemble evidence (docs, checkin/out,
delivery manifests, deposit settings) to reduce friction and fraud.

A\) Principles

Do it where the work lives: All flows start in the booking thread via
Inthread ▸ Get help; no context loss.

Outcome clarity upfront: Show a refund/charge preview based on policy
matrix and timestamps before submission.

Evidence beats rhetoric: Autoattach Smart Docs, Delivery manifests,
checkin/out, calendar logs, studio access logs, and payment lines.

Separate ledgers: Talent and Studio bookings are independent; LBG shows
a single summary with perbooking outcomes.
