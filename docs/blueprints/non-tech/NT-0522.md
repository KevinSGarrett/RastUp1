ts for SLA misses. • City
Sequencing: Some partners launch in founding cities only; we gate by
city to manage operational readiness. • Accessibility & Inclusion:
Ensure partner widgets meet WCAG 2.1 AA; provide text alternatives and
keyboard navigation.\
• Ethics & Brand Safety: Decline partners whose practices conflict with
user safety or our policy posture; include an ethics review in intake.

Implementation Notes:\
• Partner Governance: Maintain a single source of truth for partner
status (prospect, NDA, pilot, GA), contacts, contracts, scopes, and
SLAs. Tag all features behind partner flags and city gates to avoid
blast‑radius mistakes. • Privacy & Data: Apply least‑data
principles---only request scopes needed for the user value; rotate
tokens; revoke access on inactivity. • Security & Audits: Vendor
SOC/pentest reports stored with expiry reminders; incident bridges
pre‑arranged for Sev‑1/Sev‑0. • Co‑Marketing Discipline: Announce after
pilots prove value; enforce clear success metrics; align PR/brand tone
with our artistic‑only policy. • Support & Playbooks: Create
partner‑specific macros; train Support/Trust on integration quirks; log
incidents with partner tags. • Measurement: Attribute partner impact in
§5 dashboards (e.g., ACH share by vendor, IDV completion rate by
provider, studio attach from verified partners). • Contracts: Avoid
exclusivity unless compensated; require termination rights, data
return/delete clauses, and uptime credits for SLA misses. • City
