payout, not buyer total; shown as "Provider earns more with Instant
Book" tooltip.

Fee transparency

Inline "What do platform fees cover?" tooltip: escrow, contracts,
support, processing.

F\) Confirm Step

Success page shows two booking tiles (Talent • Studio) with: status,
dates, "Open thread," "Add to calendar," "View Docs," "Share itinerary."

Deposit hold line (Studio): clearly states authorization amount &
automatic release window (e.g., 48h postcheckout if no claim).

Trusted contact prompt (optional safety feature): share generalarea
location & times during the session.

Next actions:

Buyer: "Message" / "Request reschedule" / "Add notes for shoot"

Seller/Host: "Review details" / "Send prep notes" / "Share access code"
(studio)

G\) Pricing & Calculations (display rules)

cleaning + approved addons)

Buyer fee (5% card / 3% ACH when enabled; min \$3; nonrefundable on
buyer cancels per policy)

Deposit hold (Studio only; authorization)

Total charged now (escrow amounts)

Group total shown at bottom in LBG; collapsible breakdown.

H\) Edits & Reschedules (pre/postconfirmation)

Before confirmation

Edit time, add/remove addons; LBG validates both bookings.

Changing Talent time proposes Studio shift (and viceversa); if not
possible, show split option or alternatives.

After confirmation (flows in thread, per §1.3 addendum)

Propose reschedule to both bookings in LBG; new times quoted &
reauthorized if totals change.

Split LBG if only one party can accommodate change (buyer chooses);
refunds per respective matrices.

Change orders (Talent) & duration changes (Studio) recalc totals;
amended docs issued.

I\) Cancellations & Refund Preview

Inline policy previews on each panel with "Learn more" to KB.

Cancellation modal shows computed outcomes per booking (e.g., "Talent:
50% refund • Studio: 0% refund") and a group summary.

Host/Sellerfault cancels: autorefunds buyer fee for that booking;
goodwill credits as configured (§3.9).

J\) Receipts & Calendar

Unified receipt with two sections (Talent • Studio), fees, taxes, and
deposit authorization line (Studio).

ICS invites per booking; Linked Group itinerary (combined) downloadable.

Tax docs stored per booking (not shown at checkout).

K\) Error Handling & Edge Cases

Payment declined / 3DS fail: stay on Payment step; show reason; allow
method switch.

Deposit hold fail (Studio): surface amount & bank advice; offer to
remove Studio or retry.

Doublebooking race: if availability disappears between Details and Pay,
show conflict modal with alternatives.

Early exit policy note (Studio): no prorata refunds unless host agrees;
checkout governs overtime only.
