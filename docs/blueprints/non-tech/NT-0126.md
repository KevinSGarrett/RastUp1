g message using case type & policy;
agent reviews/edits.

Autoreminders: revision requested → followup in 48h; acceptance window
about to expire.

J\) Comms & Templates

Template packs (editable in §4.14.10): safetyneutral, plainEnglish,
localized.

Macros per case type with dynamic fields (names, amounts, dates, policy
links).

Tone checks: disallow blamey or legalese phrases; suggest neutral
alternatives.

K\) Integrations & Handoffs

Finance (§4.14.6): refunds/credits/deposit captures post to ledger;
payout holds released on resolve.

T&S (§4.14.3): safetycolored cases mirror to T&S; sanctions reflected
back.

Content (§4.14.4): if dispute reveals policybreaking content → removal &
strike handoff.

Tax (§4.12): amended receipts reflect tax deltas; yearend summaries
updated.

Analytics (Section 5): case and resolution data to warehouse.

L\) Metrics & QA

Ops KPIs

First response & timetoresolution by queue.

Refund error rate (target \< 1%).

\% cases resolved selfserve (target ↑ over time).

Chargeback win rate; deposit claim success rate.

CSAT after resolution; NPS impact for buyers/providers.

Quality

Weekly case reviews; coaching notes; macro hygiene; consistency checks
across agents/cities.

N\) Acceptance Criteria (mark 4.14.5 FINAL)

Multichannel intake + autocase triggers wired; LBGaware grouping.

Case view shows full context + evidence + policy helper + calculators.

Refund/Delivery/Travel/Deposit calculators apply outcomes and issue
amended receipts.

Standard workflows implemented for noshow, late/partial delivery, access
failure, deposit claims, chargebacks, LBG splits.

Neutral Review Panel flow live with documented outcomes and Reputation
updates.

Goodwill credits with caps and audit; abuse exclusions enforced.

Integrations with Finance, T&S, Content, Tax; ledger and payouts reflect
decisions.

SLA timers, metrics dashboards, and QA process; Telemetry events
emitted.

O\) Why this works

Fast, fair, consistent outcomes without engineering.

One case, full picture: booking, chat, deliverables, rules---reduces
backandforth.

Policyaccurate math via calculators prevents costly mistakes.

Auditable: amended receipts, evidence hashes, and documented rationales.

Goal: Run money ops safely and fast---payouts, reserves,

provide auditable, reversible actions with dualapproval where needed.
