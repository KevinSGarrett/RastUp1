adiness; drills; ACH fallback and banners.\
• In‑chat off‑platform warnings; escrow value copy; IB incentives for
verified users.\
• RBAC, JIT elevation, two‑person approvals; vendor due diligence; PII
vault.\
• Tax engine allowlists; nightly reconciliations; receipt itemization
tests.\
• Staffing buffers; calculators/macros; deflection via help‑center;
admin operability gates.

Incident playbooks (summary):\
• Moderation surge → raise Safe‑Mode thresholds; add moderators; publish
guidance.\
• Processor incident → switch rails; queue retries; pause promotions;
status page updates.\
• Fraud ring → tighten DM limits; require IDV; suppress Instant Book;
manual review.\
• PII incident → incident command; containment; counsel; notifications;
post‑mortem.\
• Tax outage → allowlist bypass; pending tax receipts; reconciliation
corrections.\
• Support overload → triage macros; priority queues; temporary hours
extension; surge staffing.

RACI / Owners:\
• Risk DRI (cross‑functional), City GM, Trust Lead, Payments PM, Tax PM,
SRE, Support Lead, Legal.

Instrumentation & success metrics:\
• Risk Priority Number (RPN) tallied monthly; top‑10 risks reviewed in
exec meeting.\
• Time to mitigation for red risks; number of incidents by SEV; audit
action completion rate.

Thresholds & triggers (Go/No‑Go, rollback, escalation):\
• Any red risk (RPN ≥ 16 on 1--5×1--5 with impact weighted) triggers
weekly review and action plan.\
• Two consecutive months with rising RPN in the same category triggers
board visibility.

Dependencies & assumptions:\
• Section 5 dashboards; Section 8 policies; Section 10 incident drills;
Admin §4.14 tooling.

Acceptance checklist (risk under control when):\
□ Risk register live with owners; reviewed monthly; versioned.\
□ Scoring rubric published; examples for each score; training
completed.\
□ Top‑10 risks have explicit mitigations, flags, and playbooks.

Scenario Deep‑Dive --- Conflicting risk mitigations:\
Context: A mitigation for promotions harms search fairness KPIs.\
Trigger: Organic S→I drops \> 10% after promotions tweak.\
Immediate actions: Revert via flag; expand holdout; convene
cross‑functional review; adjust QS weight.\
Communication: Internal only; no user comms unless visible changes
persist.\
Rollback/Forward: Restore prior QS; publish learnings in registry.\
Owner: Growth + Product \| Telemetry: S→I, buyer hide/report rates, ROAS
\| Evidence: A/B logs; click maps; holdout diffs

Execution Notes:\
• Every risk has a dashboard tile with an owner, a definition of the
denominator, and a weekly narrative. • Risk reviews pair with §10
post‑launch 7/30/90‑day reviews and §8 compliance calendar. • Where a
risk spans multiple squads, the city GM or Risk DRI chairs the review;
actions have due dates. • We prefer reversible changes (flags) and
narrow blast radius (city gates). • We avoid \'security by obscurity\';
we publish clear user guidance, train staff, and keep audit trails for
all sensitive actions. • The risk register itself is versioned; changes
record rationale and observed metrics.
