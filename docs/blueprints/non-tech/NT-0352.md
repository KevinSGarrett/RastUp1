leverage (support, SRE).

Modeling Deep‑Dive:\
• Scenario setup: Define a city cohort with starting supply and demand,
apply search→inquiry and inquiry→booking rates from §6.2/§6.3, then
layer on cancellations, lateness, and chargebacks. Compute GMV per
cohort and pass it through fee structure, taxes, and processor costs.\
• Unit economics: For a representative \$X booking, compute provider fee
(12%), buyer fee (5% or 3% with ACH), and processing cost. Show platform
net before variable ops (content safety scans, IDV/BG subsidies). Repeat
for small (≤\$150), mid (\$300--\$600), and large (\>\$1,000) bookings.\
• Promotions ROI: Using holdouts, estimate incremental GMV from paid
exposure. Attribute revenue to promotions net of invalid‑click credits.
Ensure quality score and eligibility keep paid from cannibalizing
organic relevance.\
• Sensitivity toggles: Vary ACH adoption (10--40%), chargebacks
(0.2--0.6%), cancellations (3--10%), and promotions adoption (5--25%) to
see contribution margin swings.\
• City expansion: Add a second city with a 3--6 month lag. Reuse
maturation curves and observe shared services leverage (support, SRE).
