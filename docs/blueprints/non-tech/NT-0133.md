ating enforced (ID
Verified + Rep ≥ 70 + no strikes).

Density & frequency caps configurable; respected at runtime; Promoted
labeling present.

QS weights tunable with simulation; ordering formula log(bid)\*α +
QS\*(1−α) enforced within paid slots only.

Fraud controls: invalid click detection with autocredits; overspend
guard; abuse autopause.

Experiments on caps, QS α, ribbons; autostop on trust KPI breach.

Reporting: spend, CPC, CPB, attributed bookings/GMV, incremental ROAS
via holdout, invalid click & hide rates, revenue contribution.

Wallet & Finance linkage for charges, credits, makegoods; audit trail
intact.

Alerts on spikes, quality thresholds, low ROAS, inventory saturation;
Telemetry events firing.

M\) Why this works

Citybycity control without code lets you stabilize early markets and
price inventory rationally.

Fairness preserved: relevance first, paid only in marked slots, strict
caps---so buyers trust results.

Provable value keeps spend durable (holdoutmeasured ROAS).

Operationally safe: fraud shielding, autocredits, experiments with
guardrails, and quick rollbacks.

§4.14.9 --- City Ops & Supply Seeding

Goal: Give Ops a nocode cockpit to launch and grow each city: set supply
targets by role, seed highquality providers and studios, run
foundingcity perks, balance demand vs. supply, and keep
rotations/spotlights fair---without code changes.

A\) Scope, Roles & Guardrails

Who uses this: City/Market Ops (lead), Marketing (copilot), Trust &
Safety (eligibility), Finance (budgets), Readonly Auditor.\
What it controls: city cohorts, supply targets, foundingcity perks,
verification subsidies, invite/referral programs, "Top in {City}"
rotations, studio seeding, demand seeding (brands/RFP), local events
("Collab Day"), and city health dashboards.

Guardrails: All perks that change fees or issue credits draw from
approved budgets and obey eligibility (ID Verified, Rep ≥ 70, no
strikes). Fee/price changes use §4.14.2 approvals.

B\) City Dashboard (at /admin/city/{city})

Health tiles (last 28 days, rolesplit: Models / Photographers /
Videographers / Creators)

Active supply (# with packages + availability) • Verified % • Instant
Book %

Buyer demand (searches, inquiries, bookings) • Fill rate (% inquiries →
bookings)

Repeat bookings % • Median response time • Cancellation/noshow rates

Pricing bands median vs target • Bookings heatmap by neighborhood •
Studio availability

Alerts

Supply/demand imbalance (e.g., photogs \< target ratio to models)

Verified % below threshold • Response time drift • High cancel/noshow
pockets

Studio coverage below target • Budget burn approaching 80%

C\) Targets & Ratios (editable, guardrailed)

Supply targets by role (absolute \# and % verified):

Example (Houston P0): Models 300 (≥60% ID Verified), Photographers 220
(≥55%), Videographers 120 (≥50%), Creators 200 (≥55%).

Balance ratios (min/max):

Model:Photographer target 1.2--1.8 • Model:Videographer 2.0--3.0 •
Creator:Photographer 0.7--1.3.

Studio coverage: ≥25 Verified Studios across ≥8 neighborhoods.

Responsetime goal: median ≤ 2h; Instant Book share ≥ 35%.

(All thresholds live as keys in §4.14.2; dashboard shows current →
target with color coding.)

D\) Cohort Builder & Invites

Filters (role, distance radius, verification status, Rep, perplatform
social metrics, price band, availability, touring flag).\
Actions

Generate invite cohort: preview list, dedupe by email/social handle;
export or send.

Invite send: email/SMS templates (from §4.14.10), optional boost coupon
attachment.

Autoinvite rules: "When a provider in HOU links IG ≥ 25k & ID Verified →
send 'Founding Creator' invite + \$15 Boost."

CSV import: offplatform prospect lists (studios, creators). Merge/match
to existing accounts; privacysafe.

Tracking

Conversion funnel: sent → opened → signup → verified → first package →
first booking.
