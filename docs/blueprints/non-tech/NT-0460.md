Dependencies & Inputs:\
• Processor production; tax engine; comms; support staffing; moderation
staffing; studios partner outreach groundwork.

Top Risks & Mitigations:\
• Moderation backlog; tax errors; money reconciliation variance;
chargeback narratives; harassment waves.

Instrumentation & KPIs:\
• City S→I ≥ 20%; I→B ≥ 35%; time‑to‑first booking; dispute loss ≤
target; ACH share; payout latency; moderation SLA.

Acceptance Criteria (Go/No‑Go):\
✓ KPIs hit for 30 days; daily close green; dispute kit quality high;
help‑center parity; incident drills passed.

Staffing & Ownership:\
• City GM; Support; Trust; Payments/Tax; Growth; Data; SRE.

Milestones & Checkpoints:\
• Beta review at T+30 and T+60; PR moments; creator meetups;
endorsements.

Implementation Notes:\
• Flag Discipline: Each capability ships behind a named flag with a
runbook, owner, rollback, and blast‑radius notes. Flags default to
\'off\' in new cities.\
• Admin Operability: No workstream is \'done\' until admin tools enable
Support/Trust/Finance to handle the top 3 edge cases without
engineering.\
• Copy & Policy: All flows have help‑center articles and email/SMS
templates; copy avoids legalese and links to policy examples.\
• QA & Drills: Staging mimics production data shapes; drills include
processor/tax outages, moderation surges, and incident command
handoffs.\
• Experimentation: Features that affect marketplace economics (ranking,
boosts, fees) include holdouts and guardrails; we measure incremental
impact.\
• Data Wiring: Events land in Bronze/Silver/Gold (§5); KPIs pull only
from Gold with freshness SLOs. Definitions live in a metrics catalog.\
• Accessibility: New UI complies with WCAG 2.1 AA; screen‑reader and
keyboard paths verified; contrast ratios checked; defects triaged.\
• Security & Privacy: PII masked by default; JIT elevation for sensitive
admin actions; vendor scopes minimal; audits immutable.\
• City Readiness: City‑first artifacts (press kit, creator ambassadors,
studio partners) prepared in §10.1 runbook.\
• Post‑Launch: 7/30/90‑day reviews convert observations into roadmap
changes; flags let us tune by city without forks.
