Ensure quality score and eligibility keep paid from cannibalizing
organic relevance.\
• Sensitivity toggles: Vary ACH adoption (10--40%), chargebacks
(0.2--0.6%), cancellations (3--10%), and promotions adoption (5--25%) to
see contribution margin swings.\
• City expansion: Add a second city with a 3--6 month lag. Reuse
maturation curves and observe shared services leverage (support, SRE).

Financial Modeling Disclaimer: This section provides planning
assumptions, formulas, and structures for internal modeling. It is not a
forecast or financial advice. All sample numbers are illustrative;
replace with real inputs once telemetry in §5 is live.

Context & Alignment: We operate a US‑only creative marketplace
connecting models, photographers, videographers, and content creators
with buyers and studios. Launch strategy is subscription‑free;
monetization is via take‑rate on bookings and usage‑based promotions
(capped, labeled, eligibility‑gated). Public content is artistic‑only;
deliverables use external storage with immutable manifests. Instant Book
requires ID verification; background checks are opt‑in (Trusted Pro).
ACH reduces buyer fee to 3% where enabled. Feature flags and city gates
control rollout; admin tools and audits turn policy into software.

Goals:\
• Establish a city‑first marketing plan with measurable CAC and payback
windows.\
• Use incentives (verification subsidies, Boost coupons) instead of
subscriptions to drive quality supply.\
• Balance organic loops (boards, posts, referrals) with targeted paid
tests.

Key variables & baselines:\
• Channels: Creator referrals, studio partners, social ads (limited
tests), content marketing, PR, email sequences, RFP broadcasts.\
• Incentives: IDV subsidies for early providers; Trusted Pro coupon;
buyer fee holidays for first booking in new city.\
• Budget framing: CAC caps relative to LTV; city‑level spend with clear
stop/go criteria.

Core formulas (structure; plug real telemetry later):\
• CAC_channel = Spend_channel /
NewActiveBuyers_or_Providers_from_channel\
• Payback_months = CAC / MonthlyContributionMargin_per_user\
• LTV_user = Σ (ContributionMargin_t × Retention_t) over horizon H

City‑first tactics:\
Leverage local studios, meetups, and micro‑influencers. Feature local
creators in home carousels. Offer limited buyer‑fee holidays
(time‑boxed) to spur first bookings.

Quality over volume:\
We avoid paying for low‑intent traffic. We favor channels that yield
ID‑verified providers and ready‑to‑book buyers.

Attribution:\
UTM discipline, post‑signup surveys, and blended CAC reporting prevent
false confidence in any one channel.

Instrumentation & success metrics:\
• CAC by channel; blended CAC; first‑booking rate; time to first
booking; repeat rate at 60/90 days\
• IDV adoption; Trusted Pro share; promotions usage among active
providers

Top risks & mitigations:\
• Vanity signups → require package publishing and first inquiry to count
as activation\
• Over‑spend on paid social → cap tests; demand ≥2× contribution payback
within 9--12 months\
• Referral fraud → limit per‑account rewards; require verified activity

Acceptance checklist:\
□ City marketing brief approved; budget caps and stop‑rules configured.\
□ Referral tracking live; coupon issuance and abuse guards in admin.\
□ Attribution dashboards validated with holdout cells where feasible.

Modeling Deep‑Dive:\
• Scenario setup: Define a city cohort with starting supply and demand,
apply search→inquiry and inquiry→booking rates from §6.2/§6.3, then
layer on cancellations, lateness, and chargebacks. Compute GMV per
cohort and pass it through fee structure, taxes, and processor costs.\
• Unit economics: For a representative \$X booking, compute provider fee
(12%), buyer fee (5% or 3% with ACH), and processing cost. Show platform
net before variable ops (content safety scans, IDV/BG subsidies). Repeat
