vice to tax code mapping (e.g., Talent service,
Photography/Videography service, Studio shortterm rental, Cleaning fee,
Digital license).

Editor: pick codes from tax engine catalog; perstate overrides where
needed; reason required; dual approval for overrides.

Simulation: price example shows expected tax in a target city/county;
compares before/after.

Exemptions (Phase 2)

Buyer tax exemption certificates: upload, verify, expire; statespecific
validation; apply per booking only if valid and applicable; audit record
kept.

F\) Calculation Monitoring & Exceptions

Live Monitor

Success %, latency p95/p99; top states/cities by volume.

"Zero where expected" detector: service/location combos historically
taxable now returning 0.

Timeouts: fallback policy (failclosed for money safety) blocks checkout
or shows "Tax unavailable---please retry"; agent override path (rare)
requires dual approval and postfix reconciliation.

Exception Resolution

No code found: add/adjust category mapping; rerun calc; annotate case.

Jurisdiction mismatch: verify location; correct geocode; recalc.

Engine outage: enable grace mode flag (killswitch in §4.14.2) →
temporarily suspend new checkouts or switch to backup strategy;
autonotify Eng/Ops.

G\) Filing Calendar & Remittance

Calendar

State filing frequencies (monthly/quarterly/annual) with due dates;
owner assigned; reminders at T14/T7/T2 days.

Each filing stores: period, gross taxable, tax collected, returns
submitted, confirmation numbers, PDFs.

Rollups: city/county breakdowns; shortpaid/overpaid trackers.

Payments

Record ACH/epay confirmations; reconcile remitted vs collected; variance
report.

Exports

Jurisdiction CSV for the period (state/county/city), taxable base, tax,
count, exempt amount; importready for filing portals or CPA.

H\) Knowledge Base & Policy Text (External)

KB articles linked from receipts/Tax Center: "Where we collect tax",
"Why was tax charged?", "How 1099 works", "How to fix a W9 mismatch".

Templates maintained via §4.14.10 Smart Docs CMS; localized; review by
Tax.

I\) Metrics & Alerts

KPIs

W9 coverage ≥ target (e.g., 98% of active payees).

TIN mismatch resolution median (≤ 7 days).

1099 ontime issuance rate (target 100%).

Calc error rate \< 0.5%; average calc latency \< 1.5s.

Tax collected vs remitted variance (target \< 0.5%).

Nexus trigger alerts resolved within 5 business days.

Alerts

New state approaches economic nexus threshold (≥80%).

Calc exceptions \> threshold in any state.

1099 bounce rate \> target; undelivered forms \> N.

Filing due in ≤ 2 days and not marked "Submitted."

J\) Telemetry (Tax Ops)

K\) Acceptance Criteria (mark 4.14.7 FINAL)

W9/TIN module with payoutblock, consent capture, mismatch workflow, and
signed PDFs stored with audit.

1099 run system: preflight, preview, dualapproval, efile,
edelivery/paper fallback, corrections flow with version chain.

Nexus map and economic triggers; twoperson approval to toggle; scheduled
effective dates.

Category mapping editor with simulation; perstate overrides; approvals &
audit.

Calc monitor with latency, errorrate, and "zero where expected"
detectors; outage grace mode.

Filing calendar with reminders, submission records, confirmations, and
jurisdiction exports.

KB links & templates maintained via §4.14.10; Support sees statuses for
ticket replies.

Metrics & alerts dashboards; Telemetry events for all listed actions.

L\) Why this works

Automates the heavy lifting (forms, calcs, filings) while keeping humans
in the loop where judgment matters.

Prevents surprises with nexus monitoring, exception queues, and dual
approvals on exposurechan
