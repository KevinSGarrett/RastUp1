heckin/out
timestamps, areashare logs, studio rules, delivery manifest.

Preserve evidence (oneclick): chat transcripts, attachments, IP/device,
booking metadata, profile revisions → writeonce storage with hash
(chainofcustody).

Immediate controls (if needed):

Payout freeze (partial) on involved bookings.

IB suppression on reported party (auto for P0).

DM ratelimit for suspected spam.

Profile quarantine (search hidden) pending review.

Contact counterparties via case thread (templated, safe language).

Decide: resolve, sanction, or escalate to Neutral Review Panel
(multiagent decision) for ambiguous, highimpact cases.

D\) Evidence: What Good Looks Like

System logs: booking creation/acceptance, checkin/out, location fuzz
logs, deliverables acceptance, payment attempts (incl. offplatform
keywords).

Conversations: timestamped chat, read receipts, media (with original
metadata), message redactions visible in audit.

Studio artifacts: house rules, access codes, deposit photos/evidence,
door logs if provided.

Verification: ID/Background outcomes, studio proofs, social connect
status.

User history: cancellations/noshows, prior strikes, dispute outcomes,
responsetime stats.

Agent tooling: sidebyside view, sensitive PII masked by default; "Unmask
(reason)" gated by §4.14.1 scopes.

E\) Sanctions & Remedies (Proportionate Ladder)

Soft controls:

Education notice (policy excerpt + safer alternative).

DM throttling (reduced newconversation credits for 7--30 days).

IB off for N days (auto for P1/P2; indefinite for P0 until cleared).

Boost suppression (removes promoted eligibility temporarily).

Strikes (expire after N days unless renewed):

Strike1 (30 days): visible internally; mild ranking dampening.

Strike2 (90 days): IB off, search demotion, promotions blocked.

Strike3 (180 days): account hold or suspension; payout freezes resolved
per policy.

Hard outcomes:

Account suspension (reversible with review)

Permanent disable (twoperson approval; limited to egregious or repeated
harm)

Studio delisting (Studio Verified badge revoked)

Law enforcement referral (via §4.14.15 workflow)

Autosanction triggers (configurable in §4.14.2):

≥2 P1 cases in 90 days → auto Strike2

Any P0 credible harm → Strike3 + suspension

Repeated offplatform payment attempts after warnings → IB off + DM
throttle

F\) Risk Rules Engine (ConfigDriven)

Signals: newaccount velocity, message spam patterns, offplatform payment
phrases, device mismatch, sudden rating bursts, selfclick promos, NSFW
keyword hits.

Actions: autothrottle DMs, quarantine profile, flag to T&S queue,
suppress IB, block Boosts, require reverify.

Explainability: every auto action records rule_id, inputs, and
confidence; surfaced in case panel; tunable via §4.14.2
(weights/thresholds).

Failures safe: false positives decay; manual override clears the flag
and adds rule feedback.

G\) Background & Identity (Link to §4.13)

Background "Consider/Review" → T&S evaluates role fit, recency,
rehabilitation; adverse action flow (preadverse notice, 7day response).

Underage concerns: immediate suspension, ID reverify, documentation
gate; report via child safety playbook if credible.

Impersonation/catfish: require live selfie/ID recheck; quarantine
portfolio; strike if intent to defraud.

H\) StudioSpecific Safety

Access failure (P1): verify instructions sent, code validity; if failure
owed to host → refund policy path + deposit void; if guest misconduct →
partial capture per rules.

Unsafe conditions: hazards misrepresented → Strike & delist until
corrected; require updated photos.

Thirdparty conflicts: landlord complaints or neighbor incidents →
temporary delist; require documentation.

I\) Buyer & Provider Protections (Immediate Mitigations)

Trusted Contact ping (if enabled) for delayed checkout / SOS keywords.

Relocation: for studio lockout, offer curated alternates (Houston
list) + goodwill credit (config limits in §4.14.2).

Emergency path: surface "Get help now" → safety car
