fety Addendum (if strobe/haze/open flame indicated)

Esign before checkin: access instructions (door code) unlock only after
signatures.

Minors: if talent under 18, Minor/Guardian Release required (already in
§3.5/§3.7); studios can display "No minors" if host policy forbids.

D\) Safe Mode & Visibility

Safe Mode (18+) affects people profiles and feed content, not studio
visibility.

Studio photos and copy must remain SFW (no explicit imagery). It's
acceptable to reference "suitable for fineart nude photography" if
aligned with policy.

E\) OnSite Safety & Conduct (baseline)

Arrival & Checkin: geofenced checkin/out required for dispute
protection.

Chaperones: allowed unless host rules prohibit (hosts must state policy
clearly).

Boundaries: all onset conduct must respect talent boundaries and house
rules; harassment → immediate removal & Safety action.

Loadin/out & Crew Limit: must be honored; overages handled via
PostBooking Adjustment workflow.

Prohibited: explicit sexual acts, hate content, weapons discharge,
pyrotechnics (unless permitted & declared), illegal substances.

F\) Privacy, Cameras & Sensitive Areas

Surveillance disclosure required: hosts must disclose all cameras (fixed
or smart).

No cameras in bathrooms, dressing/makeup rooms, or other private
areas---strict violation.

Consent signage: if any camera is present in a nonprivate area, host
must display a "recording in progress" sign.

Audio recording: must be disclosed; recording conversations without
consent is prohibited where unlawful.

G\) Access, Security & Emergency

Access methods: keypad/concierge/hostmeet; share instructions
postsigning.

Emergency contact: host phone provided postbooking; platform emergency
contact tile present in thread for P0 safety use.

Incident triage: Safety P0 (threat, medical, harassment) → immediate
hotline; IB & boosts suppressed pending review.

H\) Hazard & SpecialUse Disclosures

Required rule toggles: strobe, haze/fog, loud audio, open flame,
ladders/scaffolds, wet floors, heavy props.

If toggled: Smart Docs adds Safety Addendum & checklist; buyer must
acknowledge and assume responsibility to follow posted procedures.

Open flame/pyro: disallowed unless local permits uploaded (attachment
field) and host allows.

I\) Accessibility & Accuracy

Accessibility attributes: stepfree access, elevator, restroom type, door
widths, parking.

Hosts must not misrepresent accessibility; repeated inaccuracies →
listing suppression and strike.

J\) Insurance & Deposits (clarity)

We do not provide insurance at launch. Hosts may require a COI upload
(optional field in booking thread).

Damage deposit (card hold): explained to buyer prepay; captured only on
approved claim (per §3.1/§3.9).

No platform fee on deposit captures; abuse (frivolous claims) →
penalties.

K\) AntiDiscrimination & Inclusion

Standard marketplace antidiscrimination applies to studio access
(protected classes).

Service animals: must be allowed where legally required; disclosure
needed for allergysensitive environments.

L\) Enforcement & Strikes (studiospecific)

Strikeworthy: hidden cameras / privatearea cameras, undisclosed
surveillance, unsafe conditions knowingly concealed, explicit content
facilitation, repeated access failures, repeated misrepresentation of
amenities/accessibility.

Interim measures: Instant Book disable, paid promotion suppression,
search throttling.

Remedies: require listing edits, additional disclosures, or verification
recheck.

Removal: severe or repeated violations → delist studio and potential
account suspension.

M\) Safety UX Hooks (lightweight)

Preshoot tips injected to the thread 24h prior ("Bring a chaperone if
preferred," "Share trusted contact," "Review house rules").

Trusted contact link: share session times & generalarea location with a
designated contact (fuzzed to 100--150m).

Safety banner on studio detail page: "Read House Rules & emergency exit
info on arrival."
