1 (current phase) covers our initial launch
in our first city (or region), which establishes our beachhead and
refines our core service. Assuming Section 1 covered the success of our
pilot market, we are now leveraging those learnings to expand further.
Phase 2 will consist of launching in the next set of high-priority
cities (Tier 1 markets from our selection process). We anticipate
launching in X new cities in the first 6 months of expansion, focusing
on cities that scored highest on our opportunity scorecard (for example,
\[City A\], \[City B\], and \[City C\]). These initial expansions are
milestone-driven: before moving on, we aim for each new city to achieve
key targets such as reaching Y active users and attaining a baseline
revenue or engagement level that proves local viability.

Phase 3 will expand to Tier 2 markets -- a broader set of cities once
the playbook is validated in Phase 2. In this phase (perhaps months 6-18
of the plan), we might roll out to an additional N cities each quarter,
accelerating our coverage. Here we apply our tiered strategy: some
cities might be in \"launch mode\" focusing on user acquisition and
refining unit economics, while others (including our earliest markets)
graduate to \"growth mode\". Importantly, we will set different goals
for different stages: for example, a city in its first 3 months of
launch may target customer acquisition and awareness as the primary
KPIs, whereas a city in month 12 may target repeat usage and
profitability. Our plan explicitly accounts for these stage-based goals.
As noted earlier, soft launch vs. scale stages have different success
metrics. We will not prematurely force a new market to hit the same
numbers as an established one; instead, we track its progress against
stage-appropriate milestones (e.g., by month 3 post-launch, achieve X%
customer retention and an improving LTV/CAC trend).

Throughout the timeline, we'll maintain a live roadmap of city launches
with key dates and criteria. A sample milestone plan could be:

Q1 2024: Launch in 3 cities (A, B, C). Milestone: Each reaches 5,000
users and \$50k monthly gross revenue within first 3 months.

Q2 2024: Launch in next 5 cities (D, E, F, G, H) using refined playbook.
Milestone: Reduce average customer acquisition cost by 20% versus Q1
launches.

Q3 2024: Pause new launches to consolidate and improve operations if
needed (or continue with next wave if metrics are healthy). Milestone:
Achieve overall LTV/CAC \> 1.5 in at least 5 markets as a signal of
approaching profitability.

End of 2024: 8-10 cities live. Milestone: Prove the model can scale; hit
corporate revenue target of \$X million from new markets.

(The exact numbers and cities are placeholders for planning purposes and
will be adjusted based on real-time feedback and results.) By laying out
a timeline with such milestones, we can track our progress and make
go/no-go decisions for each subsequent wave of expansion. If milestones
are met or exceeded, it's a green light to continue scaling. If we fall
short in a particular city, we will troubleshoot and improve the model
before proceeding further, ensuring we don't expand faster than we can
manage quality and performance.

Section 2.6 --- Success Metrics & Continuous Improvement

To ensure the Go-to-Market and city launch plan stays on track, we will
closely monitor success metrics and institute a cycle of continuous
improvement. Each city launch will be accompanied by a dashboard of KPIs
that measure how well our strategy is working. Key metrics include:

User acquisition metrics: number of sign-ups, activation rate (how many
of those sign-ups become active customers), and growth rate
week-over-week in the early months.

Supply-side metrics: number of service providers/partners onboarded,
their activity levels, and the supply-demand ratio (e.g. are there
enough drivers to fulfill ride requests within target wait times).

Engagement and retention: repeat usage rates, cohort retention of
customer
