ementation notes (brief)

Search index: Each Service Profile is its own document; social metrics
fields are written only for Verified Social accounts (with a usertoggle
to include/exclude unverified numbers in search results).

Metrics storage: Perplatform table of daily snapshots → compute 30/90day
growth and ER.

UI copy: On filters, add "ⓘ Verified by platform connection"; on
unverified, "ⓘ Selfreported (not platform verified)".

Addendum to §1.2 (Search)

RoleSpecific Data & Advanced Search

Recommendation: Insert these as new subsections after your existing role
filters (e.g., §1.2.7 → §1.2.11). Keep all trust/verification
definitions in §1.5; only keep here what directly affects search UI,
filters, results, and ranking.

§1.2.7 PerPlatform Social Search (IG, YT, TT, X; Phase2: LinkedIn,
Facebook Pages, Snapchat)

New filter group: "Social Platforms." Users toggle any mix of platforms,
then set perplatform filters:

Instagram --- Followers (min--max), Engagement Rate (min %), 30/90day
growth (min %).\
Live when the user connects an IG Business/Creator account; Business
Discovery may show limited public metrics for other pro accounts, within
policy.

YouTube --- Subscribers (min--max), Avg views/video (min), 30/90day
growth.\
Live when channel is connected.

TikTok --- Followers (min--max), Avg views/video (min), Engagement Rate
(min %), 30/90day growth.\
Live when account is connected (scopes required).

X (Twitter) --- Followers (min--max), Engagement (avg
likes+reposts+replies), growth.\
Subject to API access level/quotas.

Phase2 (optin): LinkedIn Pages/Members, Facebook Pages, Snapchat Public
Profiles --- Followers/subscribers if connected and API access granted.\
Until then: linkonly + selfreported stats (clearly marked Unverified).

Filter logic:

Match ANY (default) or Match ALL selected platforms.

Verifiedonly toggle (only include metrics pulled via official
connections/APIs).

Optional Include selfreported toggle to expand results.

Result cards: perplatform chips, e.g., IG 182k • 2.8% ER, TT 530k • 120k
avg views, with a "ⓘ Verified by platform" tooltip.

§1.2.8 Engagement Metrics --- Definitions & BeginnerFriendly UX

Computed consistently (shown in tooltips):

IG ER = avg (likes + comments) on last 12 feed posts ÷ followers.

TikTok ER = avg (likes + comments + shares) on last 20 public videos ÷
followers; also show avg views.

YouTube = avg views on last 20 uploads (Shorts vs longform shown
separately) ÷ subscribers.

X = avg (likes + reposts + replies) on last 20 posts ÷ followers.

Controls:

Simple mode: "Engagement level" slider (Low ↔ High) with presets (e.g.,
Top 20%, Top 10% in city/role).

Advanced mode: numeric inputs (ER ≥ %, Avg views ≥ N).

Inline explainer: "Followers ≠ engagement" (1sentence card with
example).

Freshness: nightly sync + manual refresh up to 3×/day per platform
(ratelimited).

§1.2.9 Supported Platforms --- Day1 vs Phase2

Day1: Instagram (Business/Creator), YouTube, TikTok, X/Twitter
(connected accounts).

Phase2: LinkedIn Pages/Members (partner access), Facebook Pages,
Snapchat Public Profiles (partner access).

Always linkonly fallback: users can selfreport (labeled Unverified) and
request manual verify for large accounts.

§1.2.10 Search Integration with Trust Signals & Boosting (hooks)

(Definitions and policies live in §1.5; this subsection defines how
search uses them.)

Studio access (from §1.5): add Search filter: Studio access = Verified.

References (from §1.5): add Search filter: Has verified references (≥
N).

Reputation Score (from §1.5):

Filter: Min Rep Score; Sort: Top Reputation.

Ranking: Rep Score is a tiebreaker after relevance, availability,
distance, price.

Paid Boosting (pricing & rules detailed later in Monetization):

Search can render Promoted placements (Search Boost, Profile Highlight)
only if the result still matches all active filters.

Enforce ad density caps (e.g., ≤2 promoted in top 20; ≤1 above the
fold).

Eligibility checks (Rep ≥ 70, ID Ver
