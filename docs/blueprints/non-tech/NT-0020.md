Addendum --- §1.3 Booking, Payments & Disputes (Studios integration)

Goal: Integrate Studios (space listings) into booking & payments without
complicating talent flows. Keep talent and studio as separate bookings
that can be purchased together in one checkout as a Linked Booking
Group. Preserve clear rules, escrow, deposit holds, and dispute outcomes
per type.

A\) Booking Objects & Linked Group

Two booking types:

Talent Booking (person-based: Model/Photographer/Videographer/Creator).

Studio Booking (space-based: hourly rental with rules).

Linked Booking Group (LBG): if a buyer checks out with both a talent and
a studio, we create two bookings tied under one group ID.

Independent policies & payouts per booking; the UI shows a group
summary.

Time sync: studio start/end must align to the talent schedule
(respecting min hours & buffers).

B\) Studio Checkout (what the buyer confirms)

Pricing line items: base \$/hr × booked hours + min hours enforcement +
cleaning fee (if any) + estimated taxes (if applicable) + deposit hold
(authorization, not captured).

Rules & access: house rules, max capacity, noise policy, overtime
policy, loadin/out, door/access code (released after confirmation),
parking notes.

Smart Docs (autoattach): Property/Space Release + House Rules (sign
before checkin).

Address privacy: public page shows neighborhood; exact address and
access details reveal only after confirmation.

C\) Instant Book vs Request to Book (studios)

Default: Instant Book ON (host may toggle "Approval required").

Instant Book guardrails: Instant Book requires Studio Lite verification
or host ID verification (policy toggle).

Conflicts: if the studio is IB but the linked talent is requestbased,
the LBG holds the studio slot for X minutes while talent accepts.

D\) Funds Flow: Escrow & Authorizations

Talent booking: escrow per existing §1.3 rules.

Studio booking: escrow the studio rental amount at checkout.

Damage deposit: place a card hold (configurable per listing, e.g.,
\$200--\$1,000). Not counted in GMV; expires or is partially/fully
captured only upon a verified claim.

Cleaning fee: charged as part of studio subtotal (refundable only if
host cancels).

Payment method mix: both bookings appear on one receipt; behind the
scenes, we maintain two ledgers and two payouts.

E\) Reschedules & Edits (groupaware)

Propose change (buyer or provider/host): new time/date proposed to both
bookings in the LBG.

If both accept → times shift; Smart Docs autoamend; any price deltas
(e.g., longer hours) are quoted & reauthorized.

If only one can move → buyer chooses to split the group (proceed with
one, cancel the other per its policy) or cancel both per each policy.

Price adjustments:

Talent: change orders/addons as usual.

Studio: hours & cleaning adjustments; additional fees quoted before
reauth.

F\) Onsite Flow: CheckIn/Out & Overtime (studios)

Checkin/out: geofenced Start/End taps; logs timestamps and duration.
