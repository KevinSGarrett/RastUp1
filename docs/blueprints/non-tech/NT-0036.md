continued failure.

Quality disputes: compare against package spec + sample images; propose
partial refund tiers; escalate if \>\$X requested.

Safety: immediate suppression of risky features on accused; collect
details; document local law guidance (no legal advice).

IP/device, deliverable checksums).

Content takedowns: DMCA intake; remove if valid; counternotice flow;
repeat offenders.
