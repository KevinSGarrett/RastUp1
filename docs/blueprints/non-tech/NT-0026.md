verables; optional extras.

Buyer receives an Amendment Offer card to Accept/Decline.

Add Extras / Add Overtime

Standard action cards; buyer must accept.

Incremental charge collected; escrow updated; contract addendum
generated.

Adjust Travel (downward) / Waive Fees

Provider can lower/waive automatically calculated travel; cannot
increase without buyer acceptance.

Change Location

Issue Full Refund & Cancel (Providerinitiated cancel)

Applies policy rules; may record a provider strike depending on timing.

Buyer notified immediately; calendar unblocked.

All actions render as Action Cards in the thread and update the Project
Panel in real time.

4\) Money Movement & Fee Logic (Automatic)

Escrow up / down:

Increases (extras, upgrades): capture incremental charge on buyer
acceptance.

Decreases (discounts, partial refunds): reduce escrow instantly and
adjust platform fee prorata.

After payout:

Refunds become postbooking adjustments: provider authorizes a debit (or
we net from next payout). Buyer receives refund net of any
nonrecoverable processing costs per policy.

Platform & processing fees:

Platform fees adjust proportionally to the final job value.

Processing fees follow processor policy; communicate clearly if some
fees are nonrefundable after a window.

Taxes:

Amendment updates taxable base where applicable; amended invoice/receipt
issued to both parties automatically.

5\) Buyer AutoApprove Rules (Optional, SetandForget)

Buyers can preauthorize certain provider changes:

Time shift: autoapprove up to ±30/60/90 min same day.

Date move: autoapprove sameday or within X days window.

Location change: autoapprove within ≤ 5 miles of original.

Price decreases / discounts: always autoapproved.

Travel fee reductions/waivers: autoapproved.

No autoapprove for price increases, deliverable reductions, or license
downgrades.

This lets busy buyers give trusted providers flexibility without
constant taps.

6\) Locks & Fairness Windows

Hard Lock (e.g., \< 24h before start): Provider cannot unilaterally
change time/date; must request or cancel (policy applies).

Soft Lock (24--48h): Provider request requires buyer acceptance; if
declined, original stands or provider may cancel under policy (risking
penalty).

During session: Extensions via Overtime only (both accept).

After session, predelivery: Provider may apply discounts; increasing
price requires buyer approval.

7\) Notifications & Calendar

Buyer receives clear cards: "Provider proposes new time →
Accept/Decline".

On acceptance, update both calendars, send new ICS, refresh Project
Panel timeline.

Decline returns parties to current terms; provider may propose
alternatives or cancel per policy.

8\) Disputes Interplay

Amendments are authoritative in disputes.

If parties disagree on an unaccepted proposal, original terms prevail.

Partial refunds/discounts applied by provider are final (cannot be
clawed back by provider through the UI).

If changes were forced outside rules (bug/abuse), Support can revert via
admin tools (audit trail shows all).

9\) Abuse & Rate Limits

Change attempt caps: e.g., max 3 pending proposals per booking at once.

Cooldowns if repeated declines.

Provider score impact for excessive late reschedule attempts; affects
search ranking and Instant Book eligibility.

10\) Examples (Concrete)

Provider shifts start time by 30 minutes (same day):

Buyer has autoapprove set to ±60 minutes → Instantly applied; ICS
updated.

Provider proposes moving shoot from Sat 10am to Sun 2pm:

Buyer must Accept/Decline; if decline, original remains; provider can
counter or cancel under policy.

Provider realizes commute is shorter; waives travel fee:

Applies immediately; buyer notified; escrow reduced; new receipt issued.

Buyer asks for 10 extra edited photos after the shoot:

Provider uses Add Extras → Buyer accepts → card ch
