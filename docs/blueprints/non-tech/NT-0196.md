lytics & DQ (GA expansion)

Facts: fact_lbg (group), fact_booking_leg, fact_payment(+lines),
fact_payout(+legs), fact_deposit, fact_tax, fact_promo.

DQ gates (per §5.8): allocations match, deposits math, settlement recon
≤0.5% variance, invalidclick \<7%, tax latency \<500ms median.

KPIs: LBG attach rate, studio conversion, Early Payout usage & loss
rates, Promotions ROAS/CPB, takerate, safety/1k, payout latency, tax
coverage by city.

F\) Growth & Safety Guardrails

Promotions never outrank organic relevance; caps: ≤2 in top20, ≤1 above
the fold; strict eligibility; holdouts for incrementality.

Ranker can't change paid slots; diversity caps and newseller exposure
floors enforced.

Studios require houserules esign and deposit auth; dispute evidence
collection is mandatory for capture.

NSFW policy unchanged: artisticonly in public; autoscan + human override
workflow.

G\) Operational Runbooks (GA adds)

LBG changes/refunds: apply to one or both legs; amended receipts rules.

Deposits: evidence checklist; capture/partial capture rules; time
windows; autovoid if no claim.

Early Payout: eligibility appeals, fee disputes, reserves escalation.

Ranker incidents: rollback to heuristic ordering; experiment halt
procedure.

City2 pilot: playbook for gating, promos pricing, and tax coverage.

H\) GA KPIs (exit gates)

Liquidity: Search→Inquiry ≥ 22%, Inquiry→Booking ≥ 38% (Houston trailing
4 weeks).

Studios: Studio leg attach on eligible shoots ≥ 20%; deposit claim rate
≤ 3% of studio legs; valid claim win rate ≥ 70%.

Economics: Takerate 12--13% blended on bookings; Promotions contributes
10--15% of platform revenue with median ROAS ≥ 2.5×.

Trust: IDV ≥ 65%, Trusted Pro ≥ 18% of active providers; safety reports
≤ 0.2 / 1,000 legs.

Payouts: Median payout latency ≤ 2.5 days; Early Payout used in 10--20%
of eligible legs with negligible loss.

Tax: Coverage enabled in ≥ 8 states we transact in; reconciliation
clean.

Ranker canary: ≥ +3--5% lift in Search→Inquiry with no guardrail breach.

I\) Risks & Mitigations (GAspecific)

LBG complexity → support load\
Mitigate: excellent receipts, leglevel timelines, macros, and audit;
phased rollout by city.

Deposit disputes → poor NPS\
Mitigate: clear house rules, photo evidence flow, capped captures,
structured review.

ML ranker trust concerns\
Mitigate: explainable reasons on cards, diversity caps, newseller
floors, quick killswitch.

Promotions scale → "paytowin" perception\
Mitigate: strict caps/labels/eligibility; holdoutbased incrementality
reports visible to sellers (proof of value).

Tax misclassification\
Mitigate: role/jurisdiction mapping validated; fallback banners; Admin
overrides; nightly audits.

ACH return spikes\
Mitigate: riskbased ACH eligibility; proactive comms; autofallback to
card; analyzer for return codes.

J\) Acceptance Criteria (mark §6.3 FINAL)

LBG checkout ships: unified cart, split allocations, conflict checks;
group + leg receipts; change/refund/amendments work per leg.

Studios marketplace live (citygated) with verified badge, amenities,
deposits (auth/capture/void), houserules esign.

Early Payout available peruse to eligible providers; fee applied;
statements show clear math.

Promotions GA with floors, caps, QS ordering (paid slots only),
holdouts, invalidclick credits, ROAS dashboards.

Tax engine expanded to allowlisted states; refunds/amendments correct;
daily tax exports.

Experimentation platform operational; ML ranker canary ≤10% traffic,
guarded, rollback proven.

Payments hardening (ACH returns automation, partial refunds across legs,
settlement recon v2) complete.

Admin tools for LBG timelines, deposits, promos config, and tax map
live; all actions audited.

GA KPIs (above) met or trending for 4 consecutive weeks; City2 pilot
activated behind gates.

K\) Why this works

Delivers the complete, twosided value: talent + space in one flow, with
clear money and safety controls.

Keeps monetization usagebased and fair, measured by incrementality.
