terly refreshers for T&S, Support, Finance; FCRA basics;
chargeback representment; accessibility etiquette.\
• Measurement: we track leading/lagging indicators to tune thresholds
and staffing.

Implementation Notes:\
• Feature Flags & City Gates: externally visible policy toggles ship
behind flags; Admin can rollback with a two‑step confirmation; events
are audited.\
• Admin Operability: every rule has a corresponding tool in Admin
(approve/deny/redact/pause/escalate) with immutable logs.\
• Evidence Hygiene: store hashes and immutable links; redact PII in
views; never edit originals; legal holds override deletion where
applicable.\
• Copy Clarity: explain outcomes and next steps; avoid citing laws in
emails; link to help‑center with examples.\
• Training: quarterly refreshers for T&S, Support, Finance; FCRA basics;
chargeback representment; accessibility etiquette.\
• Measurement: we track leading/lagging indicators to tune thresholds
and staffing.

Disclaimer: This document is a policy and process blueprint intended for
product and operations planning. It does not constitute legal, tax, or
compliance advice. Consult qualified counsel before publishing external
policies or taking actions that create legal obligations. All examples
are illustrative and may need adaptation for jurisdiction‑specific law.

Context & Alignment: We are launching a US‑only creative marketplace
focused on models, photographers, videographers, and content creators.\
We have chosen a subscription‑free go‑to‑market with monetization via
take‑rate and optional, usage‑based promotions that are
eligibility‑gated and capped.\
Public content is artistic‑nudity‑only; Safe‑Mode defaults for guests
apply. Deliverables are transferred via external storage (Drive/Dropbox)
with immutable manifests.\
Payments flow through card (3DS where required) and ACH (with a
buyer‑fee discount); funds are escrowed and released on acceptance.\
Instant Book is gated by ID verification; background checks are opt‑in
(Trusted Pro). Feature flags and city gates are used for reversible,
auditable launches.\
Admin consoles enable Support, Trust & Safety, Finance, and Ops to
perform routine tasks without code changes.

Goals:\
• Create a predictable cadence for legal and compliance tasks so nothing
is reactive.\
• Bundle policy reviews with product milestones; keep public pages fresh
and versioned.\
• Audit vendors and internal controls on a regular schedule.

Scope & Applicability:\
Applies to Trust & Safety, Finance, Legal, and Data teams; coordinated
by an owner who maintains the shared calendar.

Definitions (plain language):\
• Quarterly: policy reviews, RBAC access review, vendor SLAs and
security attestations, data retention jobs audit.\
• Monthly: finance close QA, tax reconciliation, promotions
invalid‑click review, privacy access ledger report.\
• Annual: SOC evidence pack progress, pentest, DMCA agent check,
ADA/accessibility review, disaster recovery drill.

Policy Statements:\
• Owners: named DRI for each recurring task; backups assigned;
escalations defined.\
• Artifacts: checklists stored in admin; timestamps captured; outcomes
posted to an internal \'compliance log\'.\
• City‑by‑city: calendar reflects city launches; tasks added as tax,
promotions, and studios enable in new cities.

Procedures & Operational Playbooks:\
• Enforcement: missed tasks trigger escalation; repeat misses lead to
process changes; calendar visible to execs.\
• Risk‑based prioritization: high‑risk tasks take precedence during
incident weeks; low‑risk items may defer with approval.

Enforcement & Remedies:\
• Data hygiene: purge jobs verified; evidence repositories trimmed;
legal holds reviewed and released when resolved.\
• Privacy: DSR volume monitored; training refreshers scheduled; secrets
rotation logged.

Data, Privacy & Retention:\
• Templates: quarterly review ch
