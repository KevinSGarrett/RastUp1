fer reversible changes (flags) and
narrow blast radius (city gates). • We avoid \'security by obscurity\';
we publish clear user guidance, train staff, and keep audit trails for
all sensitive actions. • The risk register itself is versioned; changes
record rationale and observed metrics.

Execution Notes:\
• Every risk has a dashboard tile with an owner, a definition of the
denominator, and a weekly narrative. • Risk reviews pair with §10
post‑launch 7/30/90‑day reviews and §8 compliance calendar. • Where a
risk spans multiple squads, the city GM or Risk DRI chairs the review;
actions have due dates. • We prefer reversible changes (flags) and
narrow blast radius (city gates). • We avoid \'security by obscurity\';
we publish clear user guidance, train staff, and keep audit trails for
all sensitive actions. • The risk register itself is versioned; changes
record rationale and observed metrics.

Risk & Process Disclaimer: This section is an internal risk‑management
blueprint. It does not constitute legal, tax, or security advice.
Coordinate with counsel and security leaders before externalizing any
policy or committing to obligations. All examples are illustrative and
must be adapted to the realities measured in Section 5 dashboards.

Context & Alignment: US‑only marketplace launch; subscription‑free
start; monetization via take‑rate and usage‑based promotions with strict
eligibility and caps. Public content is artistic‑only with Safe‑Mode
defaults for guests. Deliverables are exchanged via external links
(Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests; escrowed payments release on
acceptance. Instant Book requires ID verification; background checks are
opt‑in (Trusted Pro). Rollouts are city‑gated behind feature flags.
Admin Console enforces least‑privilege, JIT elevation, two‑person
approvals, and full audit trails.

Goals:\
• Prepare for high‑impact, low‑probability events with rehearsed drills
and clear command.\
• Coordinate public communications that are honest, timely, and
user‑centric.\
• Recover quickly while preserving evidence and trust.

Risk statements (top of mind):\
• Data exfiltration of PII; public leak.\
• Payments freeze (processor outage); delayed payouts; mass refunds.\
• Content policy crisis with press amplification.\
• Law‑enforcement emergency request mishandled or leaked.\
• Tax miscollection discovered post‑fact with state inquiry.

Primary causes & contributing factors:\
• Zero‑day exploit or human error; inadequate segmentation; weak secrets
management.\
• Single point of failure; webhook lag; missing fallbacks.\
• Edge moderation cases; inconsistent enforcement; unclear examples.\
• Poor intake; inadequate counsel coordination; staff inexperience.\
• Allowlist gaps; mapping errors; missed reconciliation signals.

Leading indicators & early warning signals:\
• SIEM alerts; unusual export volumes; media contact; external
researcher reports.\
• Checkout failures; payout backlog; angry tickets; social mentions.\
• Reporter inquiries; creator backlash; surge in appeals.\
• LEA emails; urgent calls; subpoenas without proper service.\
• State notices; reconciliation variances; user complaints about taxes.

Preventive controls & mitigations:\
• Zero‑trust posture; RBAC/JIT; secrets rotation; backups; drills.\
• Multi‑processor readiness; ACH fallback; status page; clear banners;
queue resilience.\
• Examples gallery; Safe‑Mode; training; appeals path; PR playbook.\
• LEA intake process; counsel oversight; audit trails; emergency
disclosure policy.\
• Tax engine allowlists; nightly reconciliation; corrective memos;
disclosure templates.

Incident playbooks (summary):\
• Breach response: contain, assess, notify as required; public
statement; long‑term hardening.\
• Processor incident: prefer ACH; pause promos; display banners;
proactive emails on payouts.\
