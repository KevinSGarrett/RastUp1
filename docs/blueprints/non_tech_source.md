Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) Index -- DO NOT CHANGE ID CODES

WBS-1: Core Product & Platform (technical implementation, SEO,
messaging, payments, admin, etc.)

WBS-2: City Launch & Go-To-Market (market research, city selection,
launch operations, marketing)

WBS-4: Talent Supply & Role Verticals (Models, Photographers,
Videographers, Content Creators / Influencers)\
\
SubSection 1.1 --- Role System Design

1\) Core Concept: "Linked Service Profiles" under One Account

One account per person (single login, single identity).

Each account can attach one or more "Service Profiles" (SP) --- one per
role:

Model SP

Photographer SP

Videographer SP

Content Creator SP

Each Service Profile is a self-contained, bookable offering with its
own:

Rolespecific fields (e.g., measurements vs. gear list)

Portfolio (images/videos assigned to that role)

Rates/packages & availability

Reviews & rating (per role)

Search index entry and URL

The Account has shared, global elements:

Display name, avatar, city/region, verification badges, background check
badge

Follower/following counts (global)

Unified inbox (roleaware threads)

Unified feed (posts can be tagged to one/more roles)

Favorites boards (can hold userlevel or rolelevel items)

Why: Treating each role as a distinct, bookable "Service Profile" makes
search and booking crystal clear while keeping life simple for multirole
users via one login and shared assets.

2\) URLs & Navigation

User overview: /u/{handle}\
Shows account header + tabs for each Service Profile (e.g., Model \|
Photographer \| Creator), global posts, and "About".

Service Profile canonical pages:

Model: /u/{handle}/model

Photographer: /u/{handle}/photographer

Videographer: /u/{handle}/videographer

Creator: /u/{handle}/creator

Search results always link to the rolespecific page (not the account
overview) to keep context tight.\
Example: From "Model" search, clicking Jane goes to /u/jane/model. From
there, users can switch roles via tabs ("Also offers: Photographer").

3\) Profile UI (What viewers see)

Header (shared)

Name, city, avatar, verification badges, backgroundcheck badge, overall
followers, quick actions (Message, Share, Report).

Role chips: Model \| Photographer \| Videographer \| Creator (active
role highlighted).

Tabs (roleaware, contextual default):

Work (role portfolio) --- grid/lightbox, role tags on media; NSFW gating
if applicable.

About (role fields) --- e.g., for Model: height, measurements,
hair/eyes, categories; for Photographer: specialties, gear, software;
for Creator: platform links, verified follower counts, engagement rate.

Rates & Packages --- hourly/day rates, packaged offers (e.g., "2hr
studio shoot w/ 10 edits").

Availability --- calendar, travel notes, response time.

Reviews --- rolespecific (default to the role you're viewing) with
toggle to view All Roles.

Posts --- profile feed; filter chips to display posts from this role by
default.

Primary CTA (contextual):

On role pages: "Book {Role}" and "Message about {Role}"

On overview: disabled until a role is selected (or show a small role
selector popover).

4\) RoleSpecific Data (Minimum Fields)

Model SP

Height, weight, measurements, dress/shoe size

Hair color, eye color, skin tone/ethnicity (selfascribed)

Categories (fashion, fitness, swim, glam, etc.)

Willingness: TFP/paid only; NSFW allowed? (if policy permits)

Base rates, travel radius/fees

Photographer SP

Specialties (portraits, fashion, boudoir, commercial, events)

Gear (camera bodies, lenses, lighting), studio access

Editing software/turnaround time

License/usage terms defaults (for contracts)

Base rates/packages

Videographer SP

Specialties (reels, music videos, events, product)

Equipment (cameras, gimbals, drones), editing tools

Deliverables (duration, formats), turnaround

Base rates/packages

Content Creator SP

Platforms (IG, TikTok, YT, OF, etc.) with verified follower counts &
computed engagement rate (if integrations enabled)

Niche(s), audience geo %, age/gender splits (if available)

Promo formats offered (grid post, story, reel, live)

Base rates/packages

Notes: All SPs inherit shared basics (bio, location), but require
rolespecific fields to be indexed for search.

5\) Search & Discovery (CategoryFirst)

Search begins by selecting a category (role): Models \| Photographers \|
Videographers \| Creators.

Home search bar has a leading role selector (defaults to last used).

Each role has its own advanced filters (different fields, operators, and
ranges).

Indexing: Each Service Profile is a separate search document.

A multirole user appears once per relevant role (e.g., "Jane --- Model"
and "Jane --- Photographer" are distinct cards).

Result Cards (rolescoped):

Avatar, name, city, role label, role rating (e.g., ★4.9 • 32), starting
rate, key highlights per role (Models: height/measurements; Creators:
followers/engagement; Photographers: specialties), verification badges.

Quick actions: Book, Message, Save to Board.

Subtext: "Also offers: Photographer" (clickable) --- but doesn't pollute
the current role results.

Saved searches & alerts are rolescoped (e.g., "Models in Houston, 5\'8+
fitness, \$\$/hour").

6\) Booking (RoleAnchored)

A booking is always tied to a Service Profile (the role being hired).

Request flow: Date/time, location, brief, deliverables, rate/packages;
optional contract terms (usage rights, model release template).

Calendar integration: One unified availability for the account; bookings
from any role block out time globally to prevent conflicts.

Rescheduling/cancellation apply to the rolebound booking, but time
blocking stays global.

7\) Reviews & Ratings (Clear & Fair)

Only bookers can review. One review per completed booking.

Rolespecific ratings:

Each Service Profile has its own star rating and review list.

On the account header (and in search cards), show perrole ratings if
they exist (e.g., "Model ★4.9 (32) \| Photographer ★4.6 (12)").

Overall rating (optional/secondary): A weighted composite (by \# of
reviews per role). Display lightly on the overview, never used in
rolespecific ranking.

Review visibility: Default to the role you're viewing with a toggle to
see All Roles (clearly labeled).

Why: Keeps feedback relevant to the service hired while still showing
crossrole reputation if desired.

8\) Messaging (Unified Inbox, RoleAware)

One inbox for the user, with smart organization:

Thread type: General Inquiry vs. Booking Thread #ID

Role context tag: e.g., Model, Photographer

Counterparty and project title/date

Status chips: New, Awaiting Reply, Payment Pending, Completed

Read receipts (✓ sent, ✓✓ read) with timestamps.

Filters & folders: By role, by status (Unread, Awaiting response), by
city/date.

Thread merge policy:

Each booking always gets its own thread.

Prebooking inquiries by role are separate threads per role (prevent
confusion).

The inbox shows conversation bundles by counterpart (expand to see
rolespecific threads).

Attachments: Mood boards, references, call sheets.

Safety: Inline tips for firsttime connections; easy report/block.

Incentives (ties to verification; see §12): base monthly newconversation
credits + bonus credits for verified tiers. Bookings and reply threads
do not consume credits.

9\) Portfolio & Tagging (Per Role, Easy to Maintain)

Media Library (account level): upload once, then assign media to one or
more roles (checks).

Role Portfolios: Each SP has Albums (e.g., "Editorial", "Fitness").
Media show role tags and collaborator tags.

Tagging collaborators: Add other users to media with role credit (e.g.,
"@Sam --- Model").

Approval queue for the tagged user; on approve, the media appears in
their Collaboration section (rolespecific).

NSFW controls (if allowed): mark media NSFW; hidden by default unless
viewer opts in.

Maintenance speed: Assigning media to roles is a multiselect action.
Bulk actions to clone albums across roles.

10\) Follows & Favorites (Boards)

Follow (global, simple):

Follow the user account (not per role) to keep counts meaningful.

Feed preferences let a follower choose which roletagged posts they want
to see (All / Model / Photographer / ...).

Favorites ("Boards"):

Save either the role card ("Jane --- Model") or the user ("Jane --- All
Roles").

Boards can mix items but default to roleconsistent when saved from a
role search.

Create projectspecific boards (e.g., "Q2 Lookbook Models") with notes,
tags, and share/collab options (optional future).

Quick actions on cards: Compare, Bulk message, Request availability
(future).

11\) Posts & Feeds (RoleTagged, Unified View)

Users can post updates (text, image, video). Each post must be tagged
with one or more roles.

Profile Posts tab defaults to the role being viewed; toggle to "All
roles".

Global follower feed shows posts from accounts you follow; filter by
role tags.

Post types (examples): Portfolio release, BTS, Availability,
Lookingtocollab (but avoid "job board" styling), Deliverables showcase.

12\) Verification Badges & DM Credits (Incentives)

Badge tiers:

Email verified

Phone/SMS verified (+5 newconversation message credits/month)

ID verified (+10 credits, search boost)

Background checked ("Trusted Pro") (+∞ credits for new conversations,
top search tier)

Display: badges in header & on search cards.

Search boost rules: Verified profiles rank above unverified (within
relevance range). Backgroundchecked get an extra boost.

Rationale: Tangible perks make verification desirable beyond trust (more
DMs, higher visibility), aligning with your incentive idea.

13\) Admin & Safety Controls (RoleAware)

Role completeness gates: a Service Profile must meet a minimal
completeness score (mandatory fields + 6+ portfolio items) to appear in
search.

Moderation by role: media, posts, and reviews are flagged in context of
a role.

Dispute/Report always tied to a booking (and thus to a role), keeping
records clean.

14\) Analytics (User & Internal)

For users (per role and overall):

Views, saves to boards, messages started, booking requests, conversion
rate, avg. response time.

Content performance: portfolio item views, post engagement.

For ops (internal):

Liquidity by city/role, search→inquiry→booking funnel, verification
adoption, dispute rates by role.

15\) Edge Cases & UX Rules

Multirole appearing in one search: Show only the matching role card;
breadcrumb says "Also offers: X" (link to other SP page).

Switching roles on profile: Keep sticky tabs visible; switching tabs
changes CTA & fields seamlessly.

Adding a new role later: Onboarding wizard for that role (fields +
minimal portfolio) before activation.

Calendar conflicts: Booking on any role blocks the account calendar.
Attempting overlapping requests prompts a conflict resolution UI.

Reviews spillover: Do not mix ratings across roles in search ranking.
Display crossrole ratings in the header for transparency only.

16\) MVP vs. PhaseUp (for scope control)

MVP must haves:

Linked Service Profiles; rolefirst search; rolespecific fields &
portfolios; roleanchored bookings; rolespecific reviews; unified inbox
with role tags; basic follows; basic favorites boards; verification +
incentives (email/phone/ID); availability blocking; NSFW gating switch
(policy-dependent).

Phase 2+ enhancements:

Packages catalogs, advanced board collaboration, post analytics, social
metrics verification integrations, audience demographics for creators,
compare view for boards, saved search alerts, deep calendar sync, and
DND windows.

17\) Acceptance Criteria (we can check these off)

From a Model search, multirole users appear only as Model cards with
rolespecific fields.

On reaching a profile from search, the Model tab is active; switching
tabs shows other roles without leaving the page.

Booking, messaging, and reviews are tied to the active role.

The inbox groups threads with role context and shows read receipts.

Users can post once and tag the role(s); feeds and profile posts filter
accordingly.

Favorites boards accept both role cards and full users; boards are
organizable and shareable.

Verification badges grant DM credits and search boost; credits are
visible in a simple meter.

Calendar is global; bookings on any role block time across all roles.

Design Rationale (short)

Rolescoped everything (search, rates, reviews, portfolio) = zero
confusion for buyers.

One account, linked Service Profiles = low maintenance for multirole
users (shared assets, one inbox).

Incentivized verification = safer community + tangible growth perks.

Categoryfirst search = faster decisionmaking + cleaner filters.

Boards & posts = stickiness, collaboration, and social proof without
turning into a job board.

Addendum to §1.1 --- Roles & IA

FanSubscription Creator (OnlyFans/Fansly/etc.) --- Role Definition

New role (toplevel): FanSubscription Creator (icon + label). Appears
alongside Model / Photographer / Videographer / Creator in nav and
onboarding.

Age gate & safe mode: The global "18+ results" toggle defaults OFF for
guests/new users. Turning it ON (with age confirmation) reveals
FanSubscription Creators and any profiles with Nudity Tier \> Lingerie.

Portfolio policy: Onplatform nonexplicit content only (artistic nudity
allowed per policy). Explicit sexual content/acts are prohibited. Links
to paid fan platforms are allowed in a dedicated "Links" block.

Deliverables scope: We support SFW collaborations and promo deliverables
(IG/TT/YT/X). We do not facilitate explicit content production or sale.

Acceptance criteria

"FanSubscription Creator" is its own role in the role picker, navbar,
and category landing pages.

Global 18+ toggle (default OFF) gates visibility; explanatory tooltip
clarifies policy.

Profile "Links" block exists; portfolio upload filters block explicit
content.

Addendum --- §1.1 Roles & Entity Model (Studios as Space Listings) ---
FINAL

Goal: Introduce Studios as space listings (not roles) that complement
talent bookings without diluting the core multirole account model. Keep
terminology crisp so search, profiles, reviews, and booking policies
remain coherent.

A\) Entities & Terminology (strictly §1.1 scope)

Account --- one login that can own multiple assets.

Service Profile (Role) --- a person-based offering the account can
operate under:\
Model • Photographer • Videographer • Creator • FanSubscription Creator
(unchanged).

Space Listing (Listing Type) --- a place-based offering the account can
own: Studio.

When verified via the light process in §3.4, it displays the Verified
Studio badge.

Key distinction: Studios are listings, not roles. Service Profiles
represent people; Studio represents a rentable space.

B\) Relationships (what can link to what)

An Account may own 0..N Service Profiles and 0..N Studio listings.

Linking (optional): A Service Profile may link one of the Account's
Studio listings (e.g., a photographer links their cyclorama).

Result: the Service Profile shows a "Owns/Has Studio" chip; the linked
Studio's detail page shows "Hosted by {Profile}".

Independence: Studios can exist without any Service Profile (e.g., host
who only rents space).

C\) Classification & Surfaces

Public categories (highlevel):

People (roles): Model / Photographer / Videographer / Creator /
FanSubscription Creator

Places (listings): Studio

Search role selector (later detailed in §4.1/§1.2) includes Studio
alongside People roles.

Profiles vs Listings:

Service Profile page = person's offering + booking widget.

Studio Listing page = space details + hourly booking widget.\
(UX/page map specifics belong to §4.0/§4.1; this addendum only defines
the entities.)

D\) Reviews, Reputation & Policies (alignment only)

Reviews & scores are typescoped:

Service Profiles accrue rolespecific reviews.

Studios accrue spacespecific reviews.

Reputation Score is computed separately for Service Profiles vs Studios
(consumed by ranking later).

Policies: Talent bookings follow talent matrices; Studio bookings follow
studio matrices (per §3.9/Studio addendum). (This addendum only records
that they are distinct.)

E\) Verification & Gating (entitylevel)

Service Profiles: ID → Instant Book; Background → Trusted Pro
(unchanged).

Studios: Studio Lite verification (address/doc check) → Verified Studio
badge; Instant Book may require verification (policy in §3.4).

Safe Mode: applies to people profiles with 18+ settings; Studios are not
gated by Safe Mode.

F\) Data Model (nontechnical description)

ServiceProfile: role_type, role_fields (varies by role),
verification_status (ID, BG), reputation metrics.

StudioListing: listing_type=studio, studio_fields (address neighborhood,
capacity, amenities), verification_status (unverified \| lite_verified),
reputation metrics.

Link: optional association from ServiceProfile → StudioListing for
"owns/has studio" chip.

Booking: distinct booking objects for Service vs Studio; can be Linked
at checkout (see §1.3/§4.0 later).

G\) Acceptance Criteria (to mark §1.1 addendum FINAL)

Studios defined as Space Listings, distinct from Service Profiles
(roles).

Account may own multiple Service Profiles and Studio listings.

Linking from a Service Profile to an owned Studio is supported (for
crosssurfacing chips only; no coupling of reviews).

Review/Rep separation: Service reviews remain rolescoped; Studio reviews
are spacescoped.

Verification: Studio uses Studio Lite → Verified Studio badge; Service
verification unchanged.

Policy separation acknowledged: talent vs studio matrices handled in
their own sections.

H\) Why this works

Clarity: People (roles) vs Places (studios) eliminates ambiguity in
search, reviews, and policies.

Scalability: One account can grow horizontally (new roles) and
vertically (add studio listings) without schema contortions.

Low coupling: Linking is optional and displayonly, preserving clean
ownership and independent

SubSection 1.2 --- RoleSpecific Data & Advanced Search

1\) Design Goal

Make search pinpoint and commercially relevant (not gear-nerdy), so a
buyer can quickly find the exact look, reach, budget fit, availability,
and reliability they need---then book in a few clicks.

2\) Global Search UX (CategoryFirst)

Step 1 (Required): User selects a Role to search: Models / Photographers
/ Videographers / Creators.

Step 2: Search bar accepts keywords; Advanced Filters change per role.

Result Card = Service Profile (rolescoped): name, city, role label, role
rating, starting rate, 2--3 rolespecific highlights, verification
badges, followers/engagement (if connected), and Instant Book badge (if
enabled).

Clickthrough: Goes to the role page (e.g., /u/jane/model) with sticky
tabs to view Jane's other roles.

3\) Global Filters (apply to every role)

Location & distance radius

Available on (date/time picker) → "Only show profiles available on this
date"

Budget / starting rate (range)

Rating (min stars) & \# of reviews (min)

Verification (ID / Backgroundchecked / Socialverified)

Response time (e.g., "usually replies within 2h")

Completion / cancellation rate (reliability)

Instant Book toggle (see §7)

Languages; Travel willing (local only / regional / national)

Last active (e.g., last 7 days)

These are the "what buyers care about" filters---availability, price,
quality, trust, reliability, and speed.

4\) RoleSpecific Filters (what truly matters)

4.1 Models

Look & presence (high impact):

Height, measurements (bust/chest, waist, hips; cup optional),
dress/clothing, shoe

Body type, tattoos, piercings, hair (color/length), eye color, skin
tone, facial hair (if applicable)

Age (18+ only platform), ethnicity (selfdescribed)

Categories/levels (fashion, beauty, fitness, swim, lingerie, artistic
nude if allowed---see §9)

Commercial/operational:

Rate (hour/day), travel radius & travel fee, chaperone friendly, release
preference (e.g., standard model release)

Reliability signals: noshow rate, ontime rate, average reply time

Social signals (if connected): platform(s), followers range, engagement
rate, audience top geos, growth rate 30d (see §5)

Competitors already filter basics like hair/height/measurements; we add
reliability, availability, and audience quality---which they lack.

4.2 Photographers

Focus on result buyers see, not gear:

Specialties (portrait, fashion/editorial, beauty, commercial, product,
events)

Style descriptors (natural light, moody, highkey, cinematic, colortrue,
retouchedlook)

Deliverables (e.g., "# edited images", RAW available?, lookbook,
campaign, ecomm sets)

Turnaround (e.g., 48h, 1 week)

Studio access (yes/no), preferred shoot types (instudio, outdoor),
chaperone welcome

Rate (hour/day/packages)

Reliability (completion rate, ontime rate), rating

Social signals (if connected): followers, engagement, recent growth

We remove gear/software filters; nonphotographer buyers don't care. We
foreground style, deliverables, turnaround, studio access, price,
reliability.

4.3 Videographers

Content types (shortform reels, promo, music video, event, interview,
product)

Deliverables (duration formats, aspect---vertical/horizontal), \# of
revisions, sound capture (yes/no), captions (yes/no)

Turnaround, rate, travel

Style (snappy/reels, cinematic, docu, productclean)

Reliability, rating

Social signals (followers, avg views---if connected)

4.4 Content Creators / Influencers

Platforms (IG/TikTok/YouTube/...); posting frequency

Followers range, engagement rate, avg video views, story views (if
available)

Audience demographics (top countries/cities, age/gender splits) & brand
safety tag

Niches (beauty, fitness, cosplay, gaming, fashion, etc.)

Deliverables & rates (grid post, story set, reel/short, live, bundle),
lead time

Growth rate 30/90d, prior brand collabs

Reliability (ontime posting rate), rating

Verified social metrics & audience demographics are available via
firstparty APIs when the creator connects their accounts (details §5).
TikTok Creator Marketplace & IG Graph API support verified metrics for
optedin professional accounts; YouTube API provides channel stats.

5\) Social Metrics: Live, Verified & Searchable

What's possible (2025):

Instagram (Graph API): For Creator/Business accounts that connect, we
can fetch followers_count, media stats, and some insights; Business
Discovery lets you query other professional accounts' public metrics
within policy. (Regular personal accounts are limited.)

YouTube Data/Analytics APIs: Provide subscriber counts, view counts,
watch time & more for connected channels.

TikTok: Via Login/Display API we can show connected profile/video info;
richer audience/engagement demographics are available through Creator
Marketplace / Business integrations for optedin creators/partners.

OnlyFans: No official public API; thirdparty wrappers rely on
reverseengineering and are not official or guaranteed. So we should not
promise live OF metrics; we can let creators link OF and selfdisclose
stats, optionally verified manually.

Product approach:

"Connect Socials" module for any role. If connected, we show a Verified
Social badge + live counts on profile & enable search filters
(followers/engagement/growth/audience geos) for those users.

Privacy & consent: Only metrics the user consents to share are displayed
and indexed.

Fallback when not connected: userentered stats (clearly marked
Unverified; not searchable by metrics).

Data freshness: sync nightly; fast ondemand refresh button with
ratelimits.

6\) Packages & Extras (Fiverrstyle) --- Required on every Service
Profile

Each role supports:

Packages (Basic / Standard / Premium) with deliverables, turnaround,
revision count, and price.

Extras (addons): examples by role

Models: "Wardrobe change packs", "Travel to location (miles)", "Social
shoutout addon", "Rush booking"

Photographers: "Extra edited images", "Rush delivery", "RAWs", "Studio
included", "MUA coordination"

Videographers: "Extra revisions", "Captions/subtitles", "Vertical
cutdowns", "Thumbnail package"

Creators: "Extra story frames", "Link in bio (X days)", "Pin post (X
days)", "Crosspost to TikTok"

Usage/licensing tiers (Commercial / Paid Ads / Exclusive / Buyout) with
clear pricing.

Instant Book allowed when provider sets autorules (e.g., package X,
availability, radius).

This removes TFP ambiguity and makes booking pure ecommerce: see options
→ add extras → pay → schedule.

7\) Fixing the "Manual Networking" Problem (for low and highfollower
users)

A. Instant Book + Smart Availability

Talent can optin to Instant Book by defining guardrails (packages,
calendar windows, location radius). Search filter "Instant Book" shows
readytobook now talent.

Smart availability filter: pick date/time → show only available Service
Profiles.

B. Smart Invites (private, not a job board)

A buyer can select up to N profiles and send a single, personalized
booking invite that reaches each privately (no public listing).

Autoaccept rules (for busy/highfollower talent): "autoaccept if: package
≥ \$X, travel ≤ Y, brand safe, date in my windows."

C. Concierge (Pro)

For VIPs and brands: a paid Concierge that assembles shortlists, handles
invites, negotiates packages/extras, and schedules. Revenue:
subscription or perengagement fee.

D. Collab Mode (for highhigh, noncash)

Zerocash collaboration contracts with deliverables (shoot + crossposting
obligations). Both sides sign; platform tracks performance (proofofpost,
content delivered).

We monetize via Pro plan features, not commission, and still accrue
reviews + reliability metrics.

E. AudienceFit Match

For creators/models: filter/score by audience geos and engagement (e.g.,
"US female 18--24 heavy") so buyers pay for reach that matters.

Existing platforms make you post castings or DM endlessly; Swipecast
leans into job posts with live chat. We avoid public job boards and keep
1to1 booking, plus powerful smart invites and autoaccept to remove the
manual grind.

8\) Boards (Favorites) for Real Projects

Save role cards into project boards, add notes (budget, fit, priority).

Bulk actions: Invite all, Request availability, Compare (rates, social
reach, reliability).

Share board as private link to collaborators (internal/agency use).

9\) NSFW & OnlyFans Policy --- Decision Framework & Recommendation

Reality: payment processors (Stripe/PayPal) restrict adult content;
explicit sexual content risks account shutdowns.

Options

Mainstreamfirst (Recommended)

Allow SFW + artistic nudity (nonexplicit) with NSFW gating and age/ID
verification; disallow explicit sexual content onplatform.

Allow OnlyFans creators as users; portfolios must follow our content
rules. They can link to OF externally; we don't ingest OF metrics (no
official API).

Use mainstream processors (easier scaling & brandsafe).

Adultfriendly lane (complex)

Permit explicit content in a segregated, agegated area; requires
adultfriendly payment processors and heavy compliance (age checks,
recordkeeping). High ops/compliance cost; potential ad restrictions.

Recommendation: Option 1 for launch. Capture the boudoir/glamour
business and OF creators (as creators) without explicit content on the
site. Revisit a dedicated adult lane only after strong traction and
compliance capability.

10\) SingleCompose Feed (No Double Posting), Smart Delivery

User posts once, tags one or more roles (Model/Photog/etc.).

Delivery:

Followers choose role preferences when following a user; the feed shows
posts matching their interests first.

Dedupe: if a post is multitagged, we only show it once to the follower.

Profile Posts tab defaults to the role you're viewing; toggle "All
roles".

Templates: Availability update, Portfolio drop, BTS, Looking to collab
(private invite CTA, not public job).

Optional: crosspost to connected socials (later).

This keeps posting simple for multirole users while giving followers
clean, relevant feeds.

11\) Extra Verifications (low cost, high trust)

Baseline (free): email + phone/SMS; 2FA optional.

ID & Age (paid): document + selfie liveness via IDV provider (e.g.,
Persona/Onfido). Typical SMB pricing starts around \$250/mo platform
minimums or percheck fees; we can pass costs to users wanting the badge.

Background Check (paid, optional "Trusted Pro"): US checks via vendor
(e.g., Checkr packages \~\$30--\$90/report). We pass through + small
margin; renewal annually.

SocialVerified (free): connect IG/TikTok/YT for verified metrics badge
(see §5).

PaymentVerified (free): valid card/bank on file.

StudioVerified (optional): onetime address + utility/biz doc for studio
listings.

ReferenceVerified (free): after N completed bookings with \>4★ average,
earn "Great Partner" ribbon (automated).

Incentives: Each badge improves search boost and DM credits (as we set
in §1.1), so verification increases bookings and offsets its cost.

12\) Pricing Impact of Verifications

We do not absorb expensive checks at scale; instead:

Passthrough direct costs (IDV/background) with small margin.

Bundle into Pro subscription (includes 1 ID check + search boost +
analytics Pro).

Net effect: verifications pay for themselves via higher ranking, more
DMs, Instant Book eligibility, and higher conversion. (We'll track
uplift in Analytics, §13.)

13\) ProviderSide Analytics (RightSized)

Core (free)

Views → Messages → Bookings funnel (per role)

Search queries & top filters that surfaced you (e.g., "5′8″+ fitness
models in Houston")

Avg position in search for your key filters (est.)

Package performance (acceptance, upsell to extras)

Reliability metrics (response time, cancellation rate)

Social snippet if connected: followers, engagement trend (30d)

Pro (paid)

Audience analytics (for creators): geo/age/gender summaries from APIs

Benchmarking: your rates/turnaround vs. local peers (by role & rating)

Price optimizer suggestions (raise/drop by X% based on conversion)

Boarding intelligence: who saved you to boards; abandoned invite
recovery prompts

ROI calculators (e.g., cost per 1k engaged audience for creators/models)

We'll use public platform benchmarks to contextualize engagement
expectations (e.g., TikTok engagement averages).

14\) Acceptance Criteria (for this section)

Rolefirst search with rolespecific filters deployed.

SocialVerified users show live metrics and can be filtered by
followers/engagement/audience (platform permitting).

Packages + Extras required for checkout across roles.

Instant Book, Smart Invites, and Autoaccept rules working (nonpublic,
not a job board).

NSFW policy implemented per recommendation (artistic nudity only;
explicit disallowed; NSFW gating + 18+ checks).

Singlecompose, multitag feed with follower role preferences and dedupe.

Verification badges confer search boost + DM credits; paid checks
passthrough costs.

Core Analytics panel live; Pro Analytics gated behind subscription.

15\) Competitive Notes (Why this wins)

ModelMayhem/PurplePort: filters exist for appearance but lack
availability, reliability, and true audience metrics; UX is dated and
often forum/casting dependent. We modernize with ecommerce booking,
reputation signals, and socialverified discovery.

Swipecast: strong on job posts & payments, but our smart invites +
instant book + verified social metrics deliver faster 1to1 bookings and
eliminate the "manual casting call" drag.

Quick Answers to Your Specific Points

"Live display of social metrics & searchable?" Yes, for connected
Instagram Creator/Business, YouTube, and TikTok (within respective
APIs/permissions). OF has no official public API---so no live OF search.

"Don't show gear/software for photographers." Done---our filters focus
on style, deliverables, turnaround, rate, reliability, studio access.

"No TFP in search; make it like Airbnb/Fiverr." Agreed---Packages +
Extras with instant book/escrow = frictionless paid bookings. We support
Collab Mode separately for highhigh noncash pairings (keeps brand clean
& still builds reputation).

"NSFW & OnlyFans?" Launch mainstreamfirst (allow artistic nudity with
gating, no explicit content). Allow OF creators on the platform but
don't ingest OF metrics. This keeps payments simple
(Stripe/PayPalcompatible) and brandsafe.

"One post or multiple per role?" One post with role tags; followers see
only what they opted into; profile posts default to the active role tab.

"More verifications?" Added SocialVerified, PaymentVerified,
StudioVerified, ReferenceVerified---lowcost, hightrust. Paid checks (ID,
Background) are passthrough with perks to offset cost.

"Analytics size?" Start with Core (funnel, search terms, package
performance), then upsell Pro (benchmarks, audience analytics, price
optimizer).

A\) Global search flow (unchanged)

Step 1 (required): pick a role to search (Models / Photographers /
Videographers / Creators).

Step 2: rolespecific filters appear; result card is a Service Profile
(SP) with role label, rating, starting price, highlights, verification,
social metrics (if verified), and Instant Book badge (if enabled).

B\) Rolespecific filters (final list)

Global filters (all roles): Location+radius, Available on (date/time),
Budget (range), Rating & \# reviews, Verification (ID / Background /
SocialVerified), Response time, Completion rate, Instant Book,
Languages, Travel willing, Last active.

Models --- "find the look + reliability + reach"

Look: height; measurements (bust/chest, waist, hips; cup optin);
dress/clothing; shoe; body type; tattoos; piercings; hair
(color/length); eye color; skin tone; facial hair (if applicable); age
(18+ only); ethnicity (selfdescribed).

Work & logistics: categories (fashion, beauty, fitness, swim, artistic
nude); base rate (hour/day); travel radius/fee; chaperonefriendly;
release preference.

Reliability: reply time, ontime rate, noshow rate.

Social (if connected): platform(s), followers range, engagement rate,
30day growth, audience geos.

Photographers --- "style, output, speed, price"

Style/specialty: portrait, fashion/editorial, beauty, commercial,
product, events; style descriptors (natural light, cinematic, highkey,
moody, colortrue).

Deliverables: edited image count, RAW provided?, lookbook/ecomm sets;
turnaround; studio access (yes/no); preferred shoot type
(studio/outdoor).

Rates: hour/day, packages.

Reliability: completion, ontime, rating.

Social (if connected): followers, engagement, recent growth.

Videographers --- "format, deliverables, speed, price"

Types: reels/shorts, promo, music video, event, interview, product.

Deliverables: runtime(s), aspect (vertical/horizontal), revisions, sound
capture, captions.

Turnaround, rate, travel.

Style: snappy/reels, cinematic, docu, productclean.

Reliability & social (as above).

Creators/Influencers --- "reach that matches goals"

Platforms: IG/TikTok/YouTube (multiselect).

Followers, engagement rate, avg views, story views (if available).

Audience: top countries/cities; age/gender split (if available).

Niches: beauty, fitness, cosplay, gaming, fashion, etc.

Deliverables & rates: grid post, stories pack, reel/short, live,
bundles; lead time.

Growth (30/90d); prior brand collabs; reliability (ontime posting rate),
rating.

Note: these social filters are enabled when a user has granted the
platform access via Instagram Graph / YouTube / TikTok APIs; otherwise
results can include Unverified stats only if the buyer toggles them on.

C\) Packages & extras (final)

Booking baseline (required): Every SP must have either

≥1 package (Basic/Standard/Premium with deliverables, turnaround,
revisions), or

A clear hourly/day rate (min duration + what's included).

Extras (optional but encouraged):

Models: wardrobe changes; travel miles; social shoutout; rush booking.

Photographers: extra edits; rush delivery; RAWs; studio included; MUA
coordination.

Videographers: extra revisions; captions; vertical cutdowns; thumbnails.

Creators: extra stories; linkinbio days; pinnedpost days; crosspost to
TikTok.

Usage/licensing tiers for all roles (Commercial / Ads / Exclusive /
Buyout) with transparent pricing.

D\) Instant Book / Smart Invites / Autoaccept (final)

Instant Book (optin):

Talent defines rules: which packages, price minimum, travel radius, date
windows, advancenotice buffer.

If the buyer's request matches, they can book instantly (escrow charged;
calendar autoblocked; chat opens for details).

Talent can cap daily/weekly instant bookings to avoid overload.

Smart Invites (private, not a job board):

A buyer selects up to N profiles and sends a single invite (shared
brief, proposed date/time/package, budget).

Each recipient receives a private request; the buyer can award 1 slot
(first to accept or manual choose) or multiple slots for team shoots.

Prevents broadcast spam; keeps everything 1to1.

Autoaccept (for highdemand users):

Talent can set autoaccept rules (e.g., "autoaccept Standard or Premium
packages ≥ \$X, weekday 10am--2pm, within 10 miles").

Perfect for highfollower users who don't want backandforth.

Payment is captured on accept; cancellation rules apply.

These three together eliminate the "manual chase" for both lowfollower
buyers (instant transactions) and highfollowertohighfollower pairings
(autoaccept + Smart Invites).

E\) Social metrics (productized)

Connect Socials (any role):

Instagram (Creator/Business): followers_count, recent media stats, and
Insights where permissioned.

YouTube: subscriberCount, views, watch time via Data/Analytics APIs.

TikTok: Display/authorized user info (follower counts where scopes
permit).

OnlyFans: link only (no live metrics---no official public API).

Verification levels:

Verified Social (connected): metrics shown, appear in Verifiedonly
filters.

Unverified (selfreported): labeled clearly; excluded when buyers toggle
"Verified only."

How we compute "engagement rate":

IG: avg(likes+comments) on last 12 feed posts ÷ followers.

TikTok: avg views/likes on last 20 public videos ÷ followers (show both
ER and avg views).

YouTube: avg views per video last 20 ÷ subscribers (plus shorts vs
nonshorts disclosure).\
(Exact formulas displayed in "ⓘ" tooltips on the filter panel.)

Freshness & load:

Nightly sync; manual refresh up to 3×/day per platform (ratelimited).

We store daily snapshots to calculate 30/90day growth and show a trend
sparkline.

Privacy: users choose which platforms to show and which metrics to index
in search.

F\) NSFW & OnlyFans (launch rules)

Allowed: SFW and artistic nudity (nonexplicit), behind an NSFW toggle;
18+ verified users only.

Disallowed: explicit sexual content, pornographic acts,
escorting/services.

OF creators welcome: can link OF; onsite portfolio must follow our
rules; no live OF metrics.

Why: Stripe/PayPal restrictions on adult content; this path preserves
mainstream payments and brandsafe growth.

G\) Feed (singlecompose, multitag)

Creators post once and tag one or more roles.

Follower preferences: when following, users choose which role tags they
want to see; feed shows relevant posts once (deduped).

On profile, Posts defaults to the active role tab; toggle "All roles."

H\) Acceptance criteria (updated)

Rolefirst search with final role filters above.

Verifiedonly social filters work for IG/YouTube/TikTok when connected;
Unverified stats clearly labeled and excluded by default.

Every SP has ≥1 package or a base rate; extras optional.

Instant Book, Smart Invites, and Autoaccept function as specified.

NSFW policy enforced (artistic nudity gated; explicit disallowed); OF
linking allowed.

Singlecompose, multitag feed with follower role preferences and dedupe.

Implementation notes (brief)

Search index: Each Service Profile is its own document; social metrics
fields are written only for Verified Social accounts (with a usertoggle
to include/exclude unverified numbers in search results).

Metrics storage: Perplatform table of daily snapshots → compute 30/90day
growth and ER.

UI copy: On filters, add "ⓘ Verified by platform connection"; on
unverified, "ⓘ Selfreported (not platform verified)".

Addendum to §1.2 (Search)

RoleSpecific Data & Advanced Search

Recommendation: Insert these as new subsections after your existing role
filters (e.g., §1.2.7 → §1.2.11). Keep all trust/verification
definitions in §1.5; only keep here what directly affects search UI,
filters, results, and ranking.

§1.2.7 PerPlatform Social Search (IG, YT, TT, X; Phase2: LinkedIn,
Facebook Pages, Snapchat)

New filter group: "Social Platforms." Users toggle any mix of platforms,
then set perplatform filters:

Instagram --- Followers (min--max), Engagement Rate (min %), 30/90day
growth (min %).\
Live when the user connects an IG Business/Creator account; Business
Discovery may show limited public metrics for other pro accounts, within
policy.

YouTube --- Subscribers (min--max), Avg views/video (min), 30/90day
growth.\
Live when channel is connected.

TikTok --- Followers (min--max), Avg views/video (min), Engagement Rate
(min %), 30/90day growth.\
Live when account is connected (scopes required).

X (Twitter) --- Followers (min--max), Engagement (avg
likes+reposts+replies), growth.\
Subject to API access level/quotas.

Phase2 (optin): LinkedIn Pages/Members, Facebook Pages, Snapchat Public
Profiles --- Followers/subscribers if connected and API access granted.\
Until then: linkonly + selfreported stats (clearly marked Unverified).

Filter logic:

Match ANY (default) or Match ALL selected platforms.

Verifiedonly toggle (only include metrics pulled via official
connections/APIs).

Optional Include selfreported toggle to expand results.

Result cards: perplatform chips, e.g., IG 182k • 2.8% ER, TT 530k • 120k
avg views, with a "ⓘ Verified by platform" tooltip.

§1.2.8 Engagement Metrics --- Definitions & BeginnerFriendly UX

Computed consistently (shown in tooltips):

IG ER = avg (likes + comments) on last 12 feed posts ÷ followers.

TikTok ER = avg (likes + comments + shares) on last 20 public videos ÷
followers; also show avg views.

YouTube = avg views on last 20 uploads (Shorts vs longform shown
separately) ÷ subscribers.

X = avg (likes + reposts + replies) on last 20 posts ÷ followers.

Controls:

Simple mode: "Engagement level" slider (Low ↔ High) with presets (e.g.,
Top 20%, Top 10% in city/role).

Advanced mode: numeric inputs (ER ≥ %, Avg views ≥ N).

Inline explainer: "Followers ≠ engagement" (1sentence card with
example).

Freshness: nightly sync + manual refresh up to 3×/day per platform
(ratelimited).

§1.2.9 Supported Platforms --- Day1 vs Phase2

Day1: Instagram (Business/Creator), YouTube, TikTok, X/Twitter
(connected accounts).

Phase2: LinkedIn Pages/Members (partner access), Facebook Pages,
Snapchat Public Profiles (partner access).

Always linkonly fallback: users can selfreport (labeled Unverified) and
request manual verify for large accounts.

§1.2.10 Search Integration with Trust Signals & Boosting (hooks)

(Definitions and policies live in §1.5; this subsection defines how
search uses them.)

Studio access (from §1.5): add Search filter: Studio access = Verified.

References (from §1.5): add Search filter: Has verified references (≥
N).

Reputation Score (from §1.5):

Filter: Min Rep Score; Sort: Top Reputation.

Ranking: Rep Score is a tiebreaker after relevance, availability,
distance, price.

Paid Boosting (pricing & rules detailed later in Monetization):

Search can render Promoted placements (Search Boost, Profile Highlight)
only if the result still matches all active filters.

Enforce ad density caps (e.g., ≤2 promoted in top 20; ≤1 above the
fold).

Eligibility checks (Rep ≥ 70, ID Verified, no recent strikes) come from
§1.5 signals.

§1.2.11 Acceptance Criteria (Search addendum)

Search supports perplatform filters (IG, YT, TT, X), Verifiedonly
toggle, and ANY/ALL logic; Phase2 placeholders for
LinkedIn/Facebook/Snapchat.

Result cards show perplatform chips with verified tooltips; profile
pages show chips + trend sparklines.

Engagement filters offer Simple (Top 10/20%) and Advanced (ER %, Avg
views) modes; tooltips explain each metric plainly.

Filters for trust signals (Studio Verified, Verified references, Min Rep
Score) are available and integrated into ranking as specified.

Promoted slots render with clear labeling, density caps, and only within
matching searches.

Addendum to §1.2 --- Search (Models/Creators) --- Comfort & Boundary
Filters + FanSubscription Creators (FINAL)

Policy anchor: We're mainstreamfirst. Artistic nudity (nonexplicit) is
allowed; explicit sexual content/acts are not. All nudityrelated options
are 18+ and IDgated (see §3.4). Processors remain mainstreamsafe.

A\) Comfort & Boundary Filters (visible on Model/Creator profiles & in
search)

Nudity tier (multiselect, 18+ only):

No Nudity

Lingerie/Swimwear

Implied Nudity (no explicit exposure)

Topless (nonsexualized context; policycompliant)

Artistic Nude (nonexplicit; no sexual acts)

Content boundaries (toggle chips): sheer/seethrough, bodypaint, boudoir,
glamour, fetish (not allowed) clearly flagged as disallowed.

Comfort notes: freetext "Do/Don't" section (e.g., "comfortable with
implied shower scenes; no oil/latex").

Chaperone policy: "Chaperone welcome" toggle; "Femaleonly teams
preferred" toggle.

Search panel gets these as filters; results show chips like "Artistic
Nude • Chaperone OK".

B\) FanSubscription Creators (e.g., OnlyFans/Fansly) --- role & search
support

Role mapping: treat as a Creator subtype: "FanSubscription Creator".

Portfolio rules: no explicit sexual content on our platform; link outs
allowed in a dedicated "Links" section.

Metrics: since there's no reliable public API, show selfreported
subscriber counts with "Unverified" label; allow manual verification on
request (e.g., screenshot billing dashboard → staff verifies → "Verified
by Platform" chip).

Search filters: "FanSubscription Creator: Yes", Subscriber count
(selfreported), Open to Collabs toggle.

Collab deliverables: add preset deliverables like IG Collab Post, Story
Mention, TT Duet/Stitch, with posting windows (e.g., within 72h) and
link verification (see §3.5 addendum below).

C\) Age & Policy Gates

IDverified 18+ required to select any nudity tier above
Lingerie/Swimwear.

Booking form includes Nudity & Boundaries step; both parties confirm
tiers and chaperone policy.

Autoflagging: briefs requesting explicit sexual acts are blocked with
policy guidance.

D\) Acceptance Criteria

Search filters for Nudity Tier, Chaperone OK, Comfort notes present;
chips displayed on cards/profile.

Creator subtype "FanSubscription Creator" live; linkout section;
selfreported metrics with "Unverified" label + optional manual verify.

Booking brief includes Nudity & Boundaries acknowledgments; ID gate
enforced.

Addendum to §1.2 --- Search & Discovery

Filters & Chips for FanSubscription Creators

New filter group: Creator Type

FanSubscription Creator (toggle) --- shows only creators who
selfidentify in this role.

Metrics (roleaware)

Subscriber count (selfreported) --- ranges: 0--1k, 1--5k, 5--20k,
20--100k, 100k+ (shown with Unverified label unless manually verified).

Promo readiness --- "Open to collabs," "Open to SFW shoots," preferred
platforms (IG/TT/YT/X).

Social metrics --- perplatform followers/ER/growth (from OAuth
connections), as already defined in §1.2 addendum.

Comfort & safety chips (present for this role too)

Nudity Tier (No Nudity, Lingerie/Swim, Implied, Topless, Artistic Nude),
Chaperone OK, Femaleonly teams preferred.

Results UI

Cards display role chip: "FanSubscription Creator", plus social chips
(IG 182k • 3% ER) and, if supplied, Subs 5--20k (Unverified).

Acceptance criteria

New role filter & result chips live; 18+ toggle must be ON to surface
these results.

Subscriber count is labeled Unverified by default; manual verification
adds a Verified by Platform chip.

Addendum --- §1.2 Search & Discovery (Studios) --- FINAL

Goal: Add Studios as a searchable space listing type with
creativespecific filters, clear result cards, savedsearch support, and
ranking rules that keep talentfirst flows intact. This does not elevate
Studios to a coequal pillar---just a complementary search mode and
attach step.

A\) Role Selector & Entry Points

Role selector (top of Search) adds Studio alongside Model / Photographer
/ Videographer / Creator / FanSubscription Creator.

Safe Mode: does not hide Studios (no 18+ gating for spaces).

Attach in flow: When a buyer searches talent with a date/time, a
"Suggest Studios nearby" pill appears; clicking opens the Studio search
prefiltered by city/date/time.

B\) Filters (Studio role only)

Core

City & radius (mi/km)

Date & time window (single slot or range)

Duration (hours) with Min hours enforcement

Price / hr (min--max)

Capacity (people)

Size (sq ft / m²) (optional)

Creative amenities (toggle chips)

Natural light (orientation optional: N/E/S/W)

Cyclorama wall (chip) + dimension field (optional)

Blackout capable

Ceiling height ≥ N ft

Soundtreated / quiet

Parking / loadin (street, lot, garage; freight elevator)

Makeup station / dressing room

Seamless paper available (colors count)

Grip/lighting available (Yes/No; rental addon)

Climate control (A/C)

Kitchenette / bathroom / shower

Set builds / backgrounds allowed

Rules & policies

Instant Book only (toggle)

Verified Studio only (toggle)

Overtime policy shown (readonly pill in results)

Sort

Best match (default), Price, Distance, Availability first, Rating

C\) Results UX

Card content

Cover image; Title; Neighborhood; Price / hr; Min hours

Verified Studio badge (if Liteverified)

Amenity chips (e.g., Natural light • Cyc wall • Blackout • 14' ceilings)

Instant Book chip (if enabled)

Capacity; Rating (★, count)

Map view

Optional toggle; markers show price/hr; hover sync with list.

Empty states

If no matches: show nearby neighborhoods, relaxfilters tips, and
"Broaden date window" quick actions.

D\) Saved Searches & Alerts

Users can Save Search in Studio mode (all filters preserved).

Daily batched alerts for new/updated studios matching the saved query.

Combo templates: "Talent + Studio in \[City\] this weekend" creates two
saved searches (talent & studio) tied to the same date window.

E\) Ranking Logic (Studio role)

Order = Relevance to filters → Availability match (slot fit, min hours)
→ Distance → Price fit (to buyer's range) → Reputation (space reviews) →
Verified Studio tiebreak → Instant Book tiebreak.

No paytowin: Paid promotions (if enabled later per §3.3) sit in clearly
labeled, densitycapped positions and never bypass filter matching.

Freshness: recent calendar updates get a small boost (avoids stale
listings).

F\) AttachinFlow (from Talent Search)

When a buyer has a talent query with a date/time:

A "Attach a Studio" pill appears above results.

Clicking opens the Studio search preseeded with city/date/time/duration;
top three results appear in an inline drawer with amenity chips.

Selecting a studio adds it to the checkout summary as a Linked Booking
Group (see §1.3 addendum).

G\) Analytics & Events

search.role=studio, filter.apply.amenity, studio.instant_book.filter_on

saved_search.create.studio, alert.open.studio

attach_studio.opened, attach_studio.suggested_click,
attach_studio.selected

H\) Acceptance Criteria (mark §1.2 addendum FINAL)

Studio appears in role selector; Safe Mode does not gate Studio
visibility.

Studiospecific filters implemented (core, creative amenities, rules).

Result cards show Verified badge, Instant Book chip, amenity chips,
capacity, rating.

Saved search & daily alerts work in Studio mode; combo template creates
paired searches.

Attach a Studio pill appears in talent searches with date/time; opens
prefiltered Studio drawer; selection persists to checkout.

Ranking follows relevance → availability → distance → price fit → rep →
verified → IB; no paytowin.

I\) Why this works

Creators' needs first: Filters reflect real shoot needs (light, cyc,
blackout, loadin).

Low friction attach: Suggesting studios in context boosts award rates
without bloating nav.

Clean ranking: Availability & fit come before badges, keeping search
results trustworthy.

SubSection 1.3 --- Booking, Payments & Disputes

Purpose: Make booking as fast and trustable as Airbnb/Fiverr: clear
options, instant or nearinstant confirmation, escrowed payment,
transparent cancellation rules, and a fair dispute process --- all
optimized for repeatable revenue and low support overhead.

A\) Key Concepts & Objects

Service Profile (SP): The bookable unit for a role (Model / Photographer
/ Videographer / Creator). All bookings are tied to a specific SP.

Package: A preconfigured offer (deliverables, duration, turnaround,
revisions, price). Each SP must have ≥1 package or a base hourly/day
rate.

Extras (optional): Addons the buyer can select at checkout (rush, extra
edits, travel miles, etc.). Not required to publish.

Usage License: A selectable tier (Commercial / Ads / Exclusive / Buyout)
with clear terms & price adders.

Instant Book: Book without messaging if the request matches the SP's
autorules.

Smart Invite: Private multirecipient invite (no public job board) that
lets the buyer send one request to N profiles and award 1 or more slots.

Autoaccept Rules (optin): Talent-defined conditions that autoaccept
requests (e.g., package ≥ \$X, weekday window, \<=10 miles).

B\) Booking Modes (How a booking starts)

Instant Book (optin by talent)

Visible "Instant Book" badge in search.

Buyer selects date/time, package, extras, license, location, pays →
booking confirmed immediately if within rules.

Calendar blocked; chat thread opens automatically.

RequesttoBook

Buyer configures the same elements; sends a request.

Talent can Accept / Decline / Counter (send Custom Offer with different
package/price/time).

On Accept, payment is captured and booking confirmed.

SLA nudges: autoexpire unanswered requests (e.g., 48h) to keep the
funnel clean.

Smart Invite (private)

Buyer selects up to N profiles → writes one brief (date/time,
package/budget).

Each recipient receives a private invite; buyer can award one or
multiple hires.

Reduces backandforth while avoiding a public job board.

C\) Checkout & Payment Flow (Buyer experience)

Select Offer: Choose package or base rate duration; pick extras and
license tier.

Pick Date/Time: Required; availability filter helps show open slots.

Location: Address or "studio provided by talent" if applicable; travel
fee dynamically calculated if the SP adds permile pricing.

Contract Pack (autoattached):

Booking Agreement (scope, deliverables, schedule, payment terms,
cancellation, safety rules).

Usage License (for photographer/videographer deliverables; simple,
prepriced tiers).

Model Release (autoattached if booking a model).

Content Promotion Terms (for Creators: posting timeline, tag/credit
rules).

Parties esign at checkout; all docs stored with the booking.

Summary & Fees: Subtotal, platform fees (see §E), taxes (if any), and
escrow notice.

Pay & Confirm: Card or bank method; funds moved to escrow; confirmation
screen and email. Calendar blocks for both parties; chat opens.

Tip: Show a small "What you get" panel (deliverables, revisions,
turnaround, license) and a separate "What's not included" to reduce
postshoot disputes.

D\) Escrow, Release, and Payouts (Money movement)

Escrow on Accept/Book: Buyer is charged; funds held in custodial escrow.

Completion signal:

Timebased jobs (e.g., hiring a model): Provider taps "Completed" after
session; client has 24--48h to confirm or raise a dispute.

Deliverablebased jobs (e.g., photo/video/creator posts): Provider marks
individual milestones (Shoot done → Proofs delivered → Finals delivered)
or single "Delivered" if simple. Client has review window per milestone.

Autorelease: If no dispute is opened by the end of the window, payout is
autoreleased.

Payout timing:

Standard: Release 48h after completion confirmation (or window expiry).

New provider risk policy: First X payouts delayed up to 7 days or
reserve % held to reduce chargeback/fraud risk; relax as reputation
builds.

Payout methods: Bank transfer (ACH) primary; backup options (PayPal,
etc.).

Tips: After completion (or milestone), buyer can add a tip (0% platform
fee on tips to encourage generosity).

E\) Fee & Pricing Strategy (Revenue model)

Goal: be simpler and fairer than legacy directories, with enough margin
to fund verification, support, and growth.

Recommended baseline (US launch):

Provider fee (commission): 12% of booking subtotal.

Buyer service fee: 5% (min \$2).

Processing costs: Covered within these fees (we keep the math simple for
users).

Elastic incentives (drive behaviors we want):

Instant Book discount: Provider fee -- 1% on Instant Book transactions
(promotes "buy now").

Verified boosts: Backgroundchecked providers get --0.5% fee and ranking
boost (ties to Trust incentives).

Highvalue tiering: For any single booking subtotal \> \$1,000, provider
fee on the portion above that drops to 10%.

Alternatives to test (A/B later):

15% provider, 0% buyer (simpler, common in marketplaces).

8% provider, 7% buyer (shifts load to buyer; sometimes better acceptance
with pros).

We'll start with the baseline, track conversion and sentiment, and
optimize. Promotions (e.g., zero buyer fee for first booking) can
accelerate adoption.

F\) Changes, Overtime & OnSet Additions

Overtime: In booking thread, either party can propose overtime in
30/60min increments at a preset rate; both tap to confirm; card is
incrementally charged; calendar extended.

Extras after checkout: Provider can offer postcheckout extras (e.g.,
"+10 edits") as onetap upsells; buyer approves & pays.

Travel/expenses: Preapproved extras (travel miles, parking, studio
rental). For adhoc expenses: upload receipt → buyer approves (or
dispute) → charge processed.

G\) Rescheduling & Cancellations (Policies)

Providers choose one of three policy templates per SP (or per package).
Buyers see the policy before paying.

Noshows & late arrivals (defaults):

Noshow (buyer): 0% refund; provider may still be reviewed.

Noshow (provider): 100% refund + strike; buyer may review; provider
flagged for support review.

Grace: 15minute grace window; beyond that, time may be deducted or
counted as noshow per policy.

Safety & force majeure exceptions:

Harassment, unsafe location, severe illness, natural events → Support
can override to full/partial refund; strikes applied accordingly. A
"safety cancel" reason shields public review text (but logs internally).

Reschedule flow:

Either party proposes a new time; if accepted, booking updates.

If not accepted within policy windows, original cancellation terms
apply.

H\) Disputes (Fair, timeboxed, evidencedriven)

When: Buyer or provider can open a dispute before payout (or within X
hours after if autoreleased; we'll keep this window short).

What we collect (inthread):

Timeline: checkin/out times, chat logs, shared files, signed contracts,
location pin (if enabled).

Evidence uploads: screenshots, deliverables, RAW proof (when relevant).

Resolution paths:

Noshow / not as described / deliverables missing:

Timebased jobs: prorated or full refund depending on attendance.

Deliverablebased: partial refund based on % of agreed deliverables; or
full refund if nothing delivered.

Partial performance: Mediation suggests partial settlement (we generate
a proposed split both can accept).

Bad faith / repeated issues: Strikes, suspension, or removal (internal
policy).

Outcome handling:

If settlement agreed → escrow splits accordingly.

If not → platform decides per policy & evidence; decision is final (per
ToS).

Chargebacks: We retain evidence packets to contest with processor;
repeat chargebackers flagged.

I\) Contracts & Releases (Builtin)

Autoattach the right forms based on roles & selected license:

Booking Agreement (scope, payment, cancellation, IP).

Model Release (for shoots with a model).

Usage License (creator → buyer; tiered).

Promotion Terms (for creators: posting dates, tags).

Esign at checkout (both parties).

Perbooking vault: Timestamped PDFs accessible to both; immutable log.

Templates: We provide clear, plainlanguage templates; providers can
upload a Custom Addendum (subject to platform review).

J\) AntiCircumvention & Safety

Onplatform payments are required. Messaging attempts to share external
payment details trigger gentle warnings and, if repeated, temporary
messaging limits.

Why it's better here: payment protection (escrow), cancellation
coverage, dispute support, verified reviews, DM credit incentives.

Emergency tools: Inthread "Safety flag" → prioritizes to Support;
optional checkin toggle that marks arrival/departure time & general area
(not visible publicly).

K\) Taxes & Compliance (US launch)

We facilitate payments between buyer and provider and will follow
applicable tax reporting obligations as a marketplace facilitator (exact
thresholds can change; we'll align with the processor's reporting
workflow).

Sales tax: Most creative services are servicebased; taxability varies by
jurisdiction. The platform will support tax toggles per state/city and
adjust at checkout when applicable.

Yearend docs: Providers get a yeartodate earnings report and any
required tax forms via the payout provider dashboard.

We avoid giving tax advice; we provide the records and surface
processorlevel reporting where applicable.

L\) Notifications & Calendar

Email/push for: requests, invites, accept/decline, payment received,
reminder (24h/2h before), reschedule, dispute events, payout sent.

Calendar: 2way sync (readonly in MVP; writeback in Phase 2). ICS file in
confirmation email.

M\) Provider & Buyer Dashboards

Provider (per role + overall):

Next bookings; outstanding requests; required actions (confirm, deliver,
message).

Earnings (pending, available, lifetime), payouts history.

Policy & pricing quick edit; Instant Book toggles; Autoaccept rules.

Disputes center: upload evidence, view status.

Buyer:

Upcoming shoots; requests & invites; Reschedule/Cancel; Add extras;
Leave review; Receipts and invoices.

N\) Analytics Touchpoints (tiein to §1.2)

Booking funnel: Profile views → addtocart → request/IB → confirmed →
completed (per role).

Cancellation & dispute rates (per policy, per package).

Revenue by package/extras/license (help providers tune offers).

Time to accept / response time (feeds search filters).

Promo impact: Track fee discounts vs. conversion and LTV.

O\) Acceptance Criteria (for engineering & QA)

Three booking modes fully functional (Instant Book, RequesttoBook, Smart
Invite), all roleanchored.

Escrow holds funds on accept/book; autorelease on completion with
dispute window.

Overtime and postcheckout extras can be added and charged midthread with
bothparty confirmation.

Cancellation policies selectable per SP (or package) and enforced with
prorated and exception handling.

Dispute center collects evidence, supports partial refunds, and logs
final decision.

Contracts & releases autoattached and esigned at checkout; PDFs stored
with booking.

Fees applied per model (12% provider, 5% buyer) with Instant Book and
verification adjustments.

Payouts: standard delay 48h; newprovider reserve/delay policy enforced.

Notifications & calendar work endtoend (email + inapp; ICS export).

Dashboards show accurate states and histories for both sides.

P\) Rationale (why this will convert)

Fewer steps + Instant Book = more completed bookings.

Packages + optional extras clarify scope and upsell without complexity.

Escrow + clear policies reduce buyer fear and provider noshow risk.

Disputes with evidence keep support load manageable and outcomes
predictable.

Fee incentives nudge the behavior we want (Instant Book, verification)
while keeping takerate competitive.

Contracts bakedin prevent most misunderstandings that plague legacy
platforms.

Addendum to §1.3 --- Travel & Distance Pricing & Logistics (FINAL)

1\) Product goals

Make travel predictable and fair for both sides.

Prevent accidental longdistance bookings.

Keep Instant Book clean (no surprise costs).

Support true longhaul bookings with clear rules (day rates, lodging,
perdiem) without overcomplicating MVP.

2\) Talent travel policy (per Service Profile)

Each SP (Model/Photographer/Videographer/Creator) sets:

A. Base location

Home city + map pin (hidden publicly; we show city/ZIPlevel to users).

B. Included radius

e.g., 15 mi included (no travel fee). Buyer search defaults to
radiusfiltered results.

C. Travel pricing model (choose one)

Permile beyond included radius (e.g., \$0.75/mi roundtrip, cap
optional), or

Pertime travel rate (e.g., \$30/hr drive time), or

Zones (simple flat fees):

Local (≤ included radius): \$0

Regional (e.g., 16--75 mi): flat \$X

Outofarea (e.g., 76--150 mi): flat \$Y

Longhaul (\>150 mi): Requestonly (no Instant Book), requires custom
quote (flight/train/hotel likely).

D. Longhaul rules (toggle per SP)

Travelday rate (if a day is lost to transit).

Lodging required (Yes/No; minimum star rating optional).

Perdiem (meal allowance) or "expenses at cost with receipts."

Flight class policy (e.g., economy basic/economy).

These appear automatically when the distance exceeds the SP's Longhaul
threshold.

E. Instant Book guardrails

Maximum travel distance/time eligible for Instant Book (e.g., ≤25 mi or
≤45 mins driving).

Anything beyond becomes RequesttoBook (forces a conversation/quote).

F. Touring calendar (optional)

Talent can publish "On tour" dates (e.g., "In Dallas Nov 12--13").

On those dates, search treats them as local to that city (travel fees
suppressed/adjusted).

3\) Buyer search & guardrails

Default search radius (e.g., 25 mi) with a conspicuous "Expand radius"
toggle.

Results beyond the SP's Instant Book limit display "Travel
required---Request to Book."

"Visiting talent" toggle shows users who've set touring dates in the
buyer's city/date.

If a buyer selects a date/location first, we prefilter to available &
traveleligible profiles only.

4\) Travel fee calculation (checkout)

We estimate distance/time using a mapping service (e.g., Distance Matrix
API) based on talent's base location and the buyer's shoot location,
then apply the SP's chosen model (Permile/Pertime/Zones).

Line items at checkout:

Package price

Travel fee (breakdown: miles/time/zones)

Extras (if any)

License tier (if any)

Platform fee(s), tax (where applicable)

For longhaul: Instant Book disabled; buyer sees "Travel quote required."
The request flow collects flight/hotel expectations and/or "expenses at
cost" consent.

Dallas ↔ Houston example (longhaul):

If distance exceeds SP's Longhaul threshold (e.g., 150 mi), checkout
switches to RequesttoBook. The SP's longhaul rules (travel day, lodging,
perdiem) appear automatically so both sides know the terms before money
is held.

5\) Dayof transportation (local rides)

We considered offering buyers the option to prepay a rideshare for
talent. Here's the practical approach:

MVP recommendation:

Do not directly book rides inside our app. Instead, let buyers:

Cover travel via the Travel fee (fixed & predictable), or

Offer a "Local ride credit" addon (flat \$ amount) that the talent can
use as they wish.

Why not deep rideshare integration for MVP?

Uber's consumer Ride Request widget is deprecated; today they recommend
deep links to m.uber.com/app rather than thirdparty apps creating rides
endtoend.

Uber for Business and Vouchers API (and Lyft Concierge API) exist, but
they're designed for enterprise programs (credits/vouchers/guest rides),
which adds account setup, policy, reconciliation, and support overhead
we don't need at launch.

Phase2 option (if demand is strong):

Add an "Attach rides voucher" flow for enterprise buyers using Uber for
Business Vouchers or Lyft Concierge, where the buyer funds a capped ride
credit tied to the booking. We'd still keep our Travel fee logic for
nonvoucher cases.

6\) Preventing bad bookings

Hard stops: If distance \> SP's Max travel allowed, booking cannot
proceed (UI explains "Out of travel range; request a remote option or
choose visiting dates").

Soft stops: If distance triggers longhaul, we force RequesttoBook and
surface the SP's travel rules.

Calendar conflicts: Long travel times also block adjacent slots (buffer)
to avoid doublebooking.

7\) Payments & escrow for travel

Travel fees are part of the escrow amount and follow the same
cancellation/dispute policy as the job (unless flagged as nonrefundable
expenses after tickets/hotels are purchased with buyer approval).

For expenses at cost workflows (flight/hotel receipts): provider uploads
receipts → buyer approves → platform charges card and adds to escrow or
settles as a postcheckout extra.

8\) UI copy (concise and proactive)

Search chips: "Local (≤ 25 mi)", "Include traveling talent".

Result badges: "Travel required---Request to Book", "Visiting your city
on \[dates\]".

Checkout: "Travel fee calculated from distance/time using talent's
policy," (ⓘ) tooltip with formula.

Longhaul panel: "This booking requires travel arrangements
(flight/hotel/perdiem). Send a request to confirm details."

9\) Acceptance criteria (travel)

SPs can configure Included radius, Travel pricing model, Longhaul
threshold/rules, and Instant Book limits.

Search respects radius by default and clearly marks travelrequired
results.

Checkout computes travel fee via distance/time API and shows a
transparent line item.

Longhaul disables Instant Book, requires RequesttoBook, and surfaces
travel rules.

"Local ride credit" addon supported; no rideshare booking in MVP.

(Phase2) Can attach Uber/Lyft vouchers for enterprise buyers.

Addendum to §1.3 --- Contracts, Releases & Paperwork (Templates,
Requirements, Signatures) --- FINAL

Goal: Make paperwork automatic, standardized, and enforceable---so
deliverables, rights, and usage are crystal clear without forcing every
user to lawyer up.

A\) Smart Docs Engine (builtin, templatefirst)

Autoattach at booking: Based on roles in the booking, the platform
attaches a default pack of documents (below) prefilled with names,
dates, location, deliverables, fees, and licensing.

Esign builtin: Simple, legally binding esign (draw/type) with audit
trail (IP, timestamp, device).

Bringyourown: Providers/brands may upload custom addenda (PDF/DOCX) to
sign in the same flow.

Jurisdiction & minors: City/state choice adjusts venue law; minor flag
adds guardian consent + stricter photo policy.

B\) Minimum Document Set (autoselected)

Service Agreement / SOW (always): scope, timeline, payment schedule,
revisions, cancellation, dispute venue.

License/Usage Addendum (if media usage): media types, geos, durations,
paid vs organic, exclusivity options, optional workforhire clause.

Model Release (if any model present): publicity rights grant; adult vs
minor variants; explicit nopornography covenant.

Property/Studio Release (if private or providerowned space): permission
to shoot, house rules, damages.

NDA (optional toggle from buyer): mutual or oneway.

Safety Addendum (if Nudity Tier \> Lingerie): attire/coverage, chaperone
policy, changing/privacy, closed set, onsite contact.

Defaults are editable by parties before signing; diffs logged.

C\) When Are Docs Required?

Before checkin. All required docs must be esigned by both parties before
"Start" can be tapped in the app.

Brief stage: Buyers see the default pack preview on the brief; providers
see it when quoting.

No "paperless" bookings where releases are expected (e.g., shoots with
models).

D\) Enforceability Hooks

Escrow gating: Funds won't release until required docs are signed and
deliverables accepted.

Deliverables manifest references the SOW + License; disputes use these
as source of truth.

Audit trail: Signed PDFs with hash, IP/device/timestamps downloadable by
both parties.

E\) Special Cases

TFP/Collab mode: SOW + noncommercial license by default; optional
upgrade to commercial later (with price).

Fansubscription creators: Adds Posting & Attribution Addendum (see §3.5
addendum) detailing deadlines and minimum live duration; autoverify
posts via OAuth/URL.

Minors: Guardian esign required; extra safety terms; no nudity tiers
available.

Union/agency talent: Upload agency rider; overrides conflicting defaults
where allowed.

F\) Templates & Ownership

Platform maintains jurisdictionaware templates reviewed by counsel
(disclaimer: not legal advice).

Users retain rights per the signed License/Usage Addendum; platform is
not a party beyond payment terms and dispute venue.

G\) Acceptance Criteria

Smart Docs attach automatically by role; users can edit before sign.

Esign with audit trail; PDFs stored & versioned; available in booking
thread.

Checkin blocked until required docs are signed; escrow release blocked
without docs + acceptance.

Minor/guardian flows, safety addendum for nudity tiers, property/studio
release when applicable.

Addendum --- §1.3 Booking, Payments & Disputes (Studios integration)

Goal: Integrate Studios (space listings) into booking & payments without
complicating talent flows. Keep talent and studio as separate bookings
that can be purchased together in one checkout as a Linked Booking
Group. Preserve clear rules, escrow, deposit holds, and dispute outcomes
per type.

A\) Booking Objects & Linked Group

Two booking types:

Talent Booking (person-based: Model/Photographer/Videographer/Creator).

Studio Booking (space-based: hourly rental with rules).

Linked Booking Group (LBG): if a buyer checks out with both a talent and
a studio, we create two bookings tied under one group ID.

Independent policies & payouts per booking; the UI shows a group
summary.

Time sync: studio start/end must align to the talent schedule
(respecting min hours & buffers).

B\) Studio Checkout (what the buyer confirms)

Pricing line items: base \$/hr × booked hours + min hours enforcement +
cleaning fee (if any) + estimated taxes (if applicable) + deposit hold
(authorization, not captured).

Rules & access: house rules, max capacity, noise policy, overtime
policy, loadin/out, door/access code (released after confirmation),
parking notes.

Smart Docs (autoattach): Property/Space Release + House Rules (sign
before checkin).

Address privacy: public page shows neighborhood; exact address and
access details reveal only after confirmation.

C\) Instant Book vs Request to Book (studios)

Default: Instant Book ON (host may toggle "Approval required").

Instant Book guardrails: Instant Book requires Studio Lite verification
or host ID verification (policy toggle).

Conflicts: if the studio is IB but the linked talent is requestbased,
the LBG holds the studio slot for X minutes while talent accepts.

D\) Funds Flow: Escrow & Authorizations

Talent booking: escrow per existing §1.3 rules.

Studio booking: escrow the studio rental amount at checkout.

Damage deposit: place a card hold (configurable per listing, e.g.,
\$200--\$1,000). Not counted in GMV; expires or is partially/fully
captured only upon a verified claim.

Cleaning fee: charged as part of studio subtotal (refundable only if
host cancels).

Payment method mix: both bookings appear on one receipt; behind the
scenes, we maintain two ledgers and two payouts.

E\) Reschedules & Edits (groupaware)

Propose change (buyer or provider/host): new time/date proposed to both
bookings in the LBG.

If both accept → times shift; Smart Docs autoamend; any price deltas
(e.g., longer hours) are quoted & reauthorized.

If only one can move → buyer chooses to split the group (proceed with
one, cancel the other per its policy) or cancel both per each policy.

Price adjustments:

Talent: change orders/addons as usual.

Studio: hours & cleaning adjustments; additional fees quoted before
reauth.

F\) Onsite Flow: CheckIn/Out & Overtime (studios)

Checkin/out: geofenced Start/End taps; logs timestamps and duration.

Overtime: billed per listing rule (e.g., per 30 min at 1.5×).

If overtime detected (End \> booked End), host files a PostBooking
Adjustment within 24h with evidence (checkout log, photos).

Buyer has 48h to accept/dispute; we may autoapprove if evidence is clear
(policy toggle).

Crew size overage / rule violations: host can submit an adjustment claim
with evidence within 24h (caps & allowed reasons defined in listing).

G\) Cancellations, NoShows & Safety (group and pertype)

Pertype matrices apply independently (talent follows talent policy;
studio follows studio policy).

Group UX: buyer sees a combined summary showing outcomes for each
booking.

Host cancel (studio): buyer gets 100% refund on studio + \$25--\$50
goodwill credit; talent booking remains unless buyer also cancels it.

Safety exception: unsafe conduct → waive platform fees, refund
appropriately, and open Safety case; access to space can be revoked
remotely if applicable.

Noshow:

Studio: if buyer fails to check in within grace window and host was
present/available → studio payout per matrix; deposit not captured
unless damage or specific violation.

H\) Damage Deposits & Claims (studios)

Hold timing: authorize at checkout or 24h prior (host preference);
release 48h after checkout if no claim.

Claim flow: host opens claim within 24h with photos & description;
amount requested up to hold cap.

Adjudication: Neutral Review may approve full/partial capture or deny;
capture appears as a separate charge (not escrow).

Abuse guard: repeated frivolous claims throttle host visibility and may
remove deposit privileges.

I\) Completion & Payouts

Studio completion trigger: autocomplete on successful checkout (no
deliverables).

Talent completion trigger: acceptance of deliverables or autoaccept per
§1.3/Delivery Room rules.

Payout timing:

Studio: 24--48h after checkout, minus adjustments under review.

Talent: 48h after acceptance/autoaccept.

Early Payout (peruse): available to eligible hosts/providers (Rep ≥ 85)
with the 0.5% acceleration fee as defined in §3.2 (peruse, not
subscription).

J\) Receipts, Taxes & Invoices

Unified receipt shows two sections (Talent • Studio), fees, taxes (if
any), deposit hold (authorization only), and separate cancellation
policies.

Taxes: talent services vs space rental may differ by locale; we surface
hostprovided tax settings; lineitemized.

Documents: signed Smart Docs (Service Agreement, Property/Space Release,
House Rules) downloadable from the booking thread.

K\) Edge Cases & Safeguards

Doublebooking protection: instant revalidation of studio availability at
payment step; if collision, buyer gets a failsafe choice (waitlist or
alternative suggestions).

Early exit: no refunds for unused time unless host agrees; checkout time
is source of truth for overtime only (not undertime credits).

Access failures (e.g., bad code): host must provide alternate access
within 30 min; otherwise buyer may cancel for cause (full refund).

Travel fees: remain talentonly; no travel fees on studio bookings.

L\) Events & Analytics

M\) Acceptance Criteria (mark §1.3 addendum FINAL)

Two booking types implemented; Linked Booking Group supported in
checkout, thread, and receipts.

Studio checkout includes hourly pricing, min hours, cleaning fee, rules
& access, Property/Space Release esign, and deposit hold.

Instant Book for studios with optional "approval required"; guardrails
for verification.

Reschedule proposes synchronized changes; buyer can split or cancel with
pertype policies applied.

Checkin/out geofenced for studios; overtime & overage adjustments flow
live with evidence & timers.

Damage deposit lifecycle (authorize → claim window → capture/deny →
release) implemented.

Completion & payouts follow pertype triggers; Early Payout (peruse)
eligible for highrep accounts.

Receipts/invoices show separate lines & policies; tax handling surfaced;
Smart Docs downloadable.

Edge cases handled (doublebooking, access failure, early exit, travel
fees talentonly).

Analytics events instrumented.

N\) Why this works

Clarity & fairness: Separate bookings keep policies, disputes, and
payouts clean---no crosscontamination.

Low friction: Instant Book + deposit holds match studio norms while
escrow preserves trust.

Group convenience: Linked groups let buyers plan shoots endtoend with
predictable outcomes if plans change.

Operationally sane: Evidencebased adjustments and timeboxed claims keep
support scalable.

SubSection 1.4 --- Messaging, Inbox & Collaboration UX

Goal: Make communication effortless and professional from first contact
through final delivery. Keep everything in one place, roleaware, and
bookingaware to cut backandforth, prevent misunderstandings, and
increase completed bookings.

A\) Principles

Roleaware & Bookingaware: Every conversation is clearly tied to a role
(Service Profile) and, when applicable, a specific booking.

Single source of truth: Chat, briefs, shot lists, files, contracts,
location, schedule, extras, and payments live inside the thread/project.

Fast & respectful: Read receipts, quick replies, templates, and
structured forms reduce friction and ambiguity.

Safety first: Prominent tools to report, block, escalate, and check in;
privacy by default.

Anticircumvention: Keep the value onplatform (escrow, protection,
reviews), while being transparent and fair.

B\) Objects (data model at a glance)

Thread (id, type, role_context, participants, status)

Type: Inquiry (prebooking), Invite (Smart Invite), Booking (postaccept),
Dispute, System

Role Context: Model / Photographer / Videographer / Creator (from the

C\) Inbox: layout & organization

Layout:

Left pane: Folders + thread list

Center: Messages

Right pane: Project Panel (context & actions)

Folders:

All, Unread, Starred, Inquiries, Invites, Bookings, Disputes, Archived,
Spam

Filters: by Role (Model, Photographer, ...), by Status (Awaiting reply,
Payment pending), by City/Date, by Has files

Bundles: Threads are bundled by counterparty; expand to see separate
rolescoped conversations

Thread list item:

Avatar + Name, Role chip, Type chip (Inquiry / Booking / Invite), Status
chip, last message preview, unread count, date, read receipt icon if
your last message was read

Thread search:

Keyword search, file type filters, date range, role filter

Message requests:

Firsttime contacts land in Requests (under Inquiries) with Accept /
Decline / Block.

Bypass to Inbox automatically if sender meets your contact filters
(e.g., IDverified, inradius, budget disclosed).

D\) Compose & credits (spamsafe by design)

New conversation credits (monthly) per account, with bonus credits from
verification badges (as defined in §1.1).

Unlimited replies in existing threads and unlimited messaging for
confirmed bookings.

Contact filters: Talent can require IDverified only, budget disclosure,
or date provided to message.

Quick replies & snippets: Providers can save templated responses; we
autosuggest based on context ("Thanks, I'm available that day---package
options attached").

Message booster: For buyers, optional oneoff priority ping
(limited/charged) to nudge highdemand talent.

E\) Thread header & Project Panel (right pane)

Thread header (always visible):

Counterparty name + avatar; Role chip; Type chip; Status

Booking summary bar when applicable: date/time • location • package •
price • escrow status • policy

Project Panel tabs (Booking threads):

Summary: package, extras, license, price, escrow status, timeline
(proposal → accepted → shoot → delivery → review)

Schedule: date/time, buffers, reschedule button, ICS export

Location: map pin, parking notes; travel terms; share location (toggle)

Participants: buyer, provider, assistants (optional), MUA/stylist tags
(FYI only); roles & contact via chat

Brief: project description + structured brief fields (theme, wardrobe,
references)

Moodboard: pinned images/links, dragreorder, annotate with comments

Shot List: checklist of shots; statuses (planned, in progress, done)

Call Sheet: autogenerated PDF (time, location, contacts, setup notes,
schedule blocks, wardrobe list)

Files & Deliverables: proofs, finals, RAW (if allowed); preview &
approvals; watermarked previews until marked "accepted"

Contracts: booking agreement, model release, usage license, promo terms
(esigned PDFs)

Expenses: travel miles/time fees, receipts, approvals

Actions: add extras, add overtime, propose reschedule, cancel, open
dispute, mark complete

F\) Collaboration features (in chat, zero friction)

Action cards render inline (mobilefriendly):

Propose new time → selector → both see Accept/Decline

Add extra (catalog) → confirm & pay in one tap

Overtime (30/60min blocks) → both approve → charge

Upload proofs → gallery preview with Approve/Request changes

Upload finals → mark milestone "Delivered" → triggers release timer

Expense receipt → buyer approve/pay

Share location (general area, not exact address unless both consent)

Safety flag (see §H)

Annotations: On moodboard and shot list items, inline comments +
\@mentions.

Pin message: Keep key messages at top (address, wardrobe, parking code).

Labels & notes: Private labels ("VIP", "High budget", "No reshoots")
visible only to you.

Voice notes (Phase 2) and video call link (Phase 2) if needed---kept
lightweight.

G\) File handling & delivery guardrails

Supported types & limits (MVP):

Images up to 25MB each; Videos up to 500MB; Docs up to 50MB; Zips up to
1GB

Perthread storage cap (e.g., 10GB) with option to add more (paid or Pro
plan)

Preview & watermark: Proofs autowatermarked (provider setting). Finals
unlock watermark once client taps Accept or escrow autoreleases.

Large deliverables: Allow external links (Drive/Dropbox), autocapture
file manifest (name/size/checksum), and warn on expired links.

Versioning: When reuploading finals, keep prior version accessible with
timestamps.

Retention: Files retained for N months after completion (export
reminders sent before purge).

Copyright & license: Display active usage license above deliverables;
warning if buyer requests use beyond license.

H\) Safety & moderation

Safety flag (red button):

Reasons: harassment, unsafe location, payment pressure, illegal request,
explicit content violations, impersonation, other.

Immediate priority route to Support; autosuspend of Instant Book on the
accused until triage; discreet handling.

Checkin: Optional "I've arrived / I'm leaving" timestamps; can share
general location radius with counterparty; private to thread & support.

Block & report: One tap to block future messages; reporting requires a
short reason.

Automoderation:

Contact sharing & offplatform payment detection → inline warning +
educational tooltip ("You lose escrow protection, reviews, and
cancellation coverage offplatform").

NSFW policy enforcement: image scanning + manual review queues for
suspected violations.

Privacy defaults: Email/phone hidden; reveal toggle after booking
(optional per user).

DND / Quiet hours: Peruser settings; requests still deliver silently
with summaries.

I\) Anticircumvention (fair + educational)

Prebooking: External payment links/phrases prompt an educational nudge
and are softblocked; persistent attempts throttle sender's
newconversation ability.

Postbooking: External coordination is allowed (we still encourage
onplatform for records); deliverables & approvals should remain in
project for dispute coverage.

Value reminders: Periodic banners highlight benefits: escrow,
cancellation coverage, verified reviews, analytics, and search boost for
verified users.

J\) Notifications

Push/email for: new message, invite/request received, accepted/declined,
payment captured, files uploaded, approvals requested, reschedule
proposal, dispute updates, payout sent.

Digest mode: For busy users, bundle notifications every X hours unless
"Booking day" (then realtime).

K\) Roles & permissions

Owner participants: buyer & provider (full read/write).

Secondary participants (optional): assistants, MUA/stylist; invited by
owner; readonly or filesonly permission; cannot alter payments or
policies.

Tag & consent workflow: When provider tags a collaborator on media, that
user receives an Approve/Decline card in chat; on approve, media appears
on both profiles (rolescoped per §1.2/§1.1).

L\) Tieins to other modules

Booking & Payments (§1.3): Add extras, overtime, expenses from chat;
payment capture + escrow state visible in header & Project Panel.

Search & Profiles (§1.2/§1.1): Response time & reliability metrics
update based on chat behavior (first response SLA, noshow, delivery
confirmations).

Verification (§1.1): Verified users get extra newconversation credits
and priority inbox surfacing.

M\) MVP vs. Phase2

MVP

Unified inbox; roleaware threads; read receipts & typing

Project Panel (Summary, Schedule, Location, Participants, Brief,
Moodboard, Shot List, Call Sheet, Files, Contracts, Expenses, Actions)

Action cards (reschedule, extras, overtime, proofs/finals, expenses,
mark complete, dispute, safety flag)

File upload + watermark previews; external link capture

Safety flag, block/report, automoderation for offplatform attempts

DND; message requests; contact filters; quick replies

Notifications + ICS export

Phase2

Voice notes; lightweight video calls

Shared whiteboard for lighting diagrams

Realtime coediting of shot lists

Deep calendar writeback (Google/Apple)

Enterprise attachments (brand asset libraries)

Uber/Lyft vouchers (only if enterprise demand)

Inthread AI assist (generate call sheet, summarize chat, draft briefs)

N\) Acceptance criteria (for engineering & QA)

Unified inbox shows threads with role and type chips, filters and
bundles by counterparty.

Message requests workflow with Accept/Decline/Block; contact filters
honored.

Read receipts and typing indicators work across web & mobile.

Project Panel exists for Booking threads with all tabs; data stays
synced with booking object.

Action cards execute: reschedule, add extras, add overtime, upload
proofs/finals with approvals, mark complete, expense approvals, dispute
open.

File handling: previews, watermarks (toggle), versioning, external link
manifest, storage caps.

Safety: safety flag escalates; block/report works; automoderation nudges
on contact/offplatform phrases.

Notifications & DND behave per settings; ICS export for schedule.

Response time & reliability metrics update and feed search filters.

Accessibility: Keyboard navigation, proper aria labels; attachments
preview alttext.

O\) Rationale (why this will convert)

Role/booking context eliminates confusion for multirole users.

Project Panel centralizes everything---no lost emails, no conflicting
docs.

Action cards replace drawnout negotiation with onetap, auditable steps.

Safety & moderation reduce offplatform leakage and protect users,
increasing trust and repeat business.

Quick replies & templates lower response time, boosting search ranking
and request acceptance

Addendum to §1.4 --- ProviderManaged Changes & Adminless Ops

Goal: Let User B (provider) modify an existing booking with zero admin
intervention---reschedule, change price, add/waive fees, issue
refunds---while preserving buyer consent, clear contracts, escrow
accuracy, and an immutable audit trail.

1\) Change Types & Consent Matrix

2\) "Amendment" Object (Single Source of Truth)

Every approved change produces a versioned Amendment attached to the
Booking:

Fields changed (before → after), initiator, timestamp, reason code
(required), 双方 esign if it alters contractual terms (date, price,
deliverables, license).

PDF added to Contracts tab and to both receipts (for taxes and
disputes).

Audit trail (readonly) visible to both parties and Support.

3\) Provider Portal --- "Manage Booking" Actions

Propose New Time (Reschedule)

Date/time picker; optional note; shows buyer availability hints.

Autoapprove rules honored (see §5). Otherwise buyer gets Accept/Decline
card.

Apply Discount / Issue Partial Refund

Enter amount or %; choose reason (goodwill, less time, deliverables
adjusted).

Shows new totals, fee adjustments, and payout impact preview.

No buyer acceptance needed (refunds are onedirectional benefits).

Send Custom Offer Amendment (price ↑ / package swap / license change)

Configure new package/price/deliverables; optional extras.

Buyer receives an Amendment Offer card to Accept/Decline.

Add Extras / Add Overtime

Standard action cards; buyer must accept.

Incremental charge collected; escrow updated; contract addendum
generated.

Adjust Travel (downward) / Waive Fees

Provider can lower/waive automatically calculated travel; cannot
increase without buyer acceptance.

Change Location

Pick new address; system recalculates travel. If cost rises, requires
buyer acceptance; if cost drops, autoapplies and notifies.

Issue Full Refund & Cancel (Providerinitiated cancel)

Applies policy rules; may record a provider strike depending on timing.

Buyer notified immediately; calendar unblocked.

All actions render as Action Cards in the thread and update the Project
Panel in real time.

4\) Money Movement & Fee Logic (Automatic)

Escrow up / down:

Increases (extras, upgrades): capture incremental charge on buyer
acceptance.

Decreases (discounts, partial refunds): reduce escrow instantly and
adjust platform fee prorata.

After payout:

Refunds become postbooking adjustments: provider authorizes a debit (or
we net from next payout). Buyer receives refund net of any
nonrecoverable processing costs per policy.

Platform & processing fees:

Platform fees adjust proportionally to the final job value.

Processing fees follow processor policy; communicate clearly if some
fees are nonrefundable after a window.

Taxes:

Amendment updates taxable base where applicable; amended invoice/receipt
issued to both parties automatically.

5\) Buyer AutoApprove Rules (Optional, SetandForget)

Buyers can preauthorize certain provider changes:

Time shift: autoapprove up to ±30/60/90 min same day.

Date move: autoapprove sameday or within X days window.

Location change: autoapprove within ≤ 5 miles of original.

Price decreases / discounts: always autoapproved.

Travel fee reductions/waivers: autoapproved.

No autoapprove for price increases, deliverable reductions, or license
downgrades.

This lets busy buyers give trusted providers flexibility without
constant taps.

6\) Locks & Fairness Windows

Hard Lock (e.g., \< 24h before start): Provider cannot unilaterally
change time/date; must request or cancel (policy applies).

Soft Lock (24--48h): Provider request requires buyer acceptance; if
declined, original stands or provider may cancel under policy (risking
penalty).

During session: Extensions via Overtime only (both accept).

After session, predelivery: Provider may apply discounts; increasing
price requires buyer approval.

7\) Notifications & Calendar

Buyer receives clear cards: "Provider proposes new time →
Accept/Decline".

On acceptance, update both calendars, send new ICS, refresh Project
Panel timeline.

Decline returns parties to current terms; provider may propose
alternatives or cancel per policy.

8\) Disputes Interplay

Amendments are authoritative in disputes.

If parties disagree on an unaccepted proposal, original terms prevail.

Partial refunds/discounts applied by provider are final (cannot be
clawed back by provider through the UI).

If changes were forced outside rules (bug/abuse), Support can revert via
admin tools (audit trail shows all).

9\) Abuse & Rate Limits

Change attempt caps: e.g., max 3 pending proposals per booking at once.

Cooldowns if repeated declines.

Provider score impact for excessive late reschedule attempts; affects
search ranking and Instant Book eligibility.

10\) Examples (Concrete)

Provider shifts start time by 30 minutes (same day):

Buyer has autoapprove set to ±60 minutes → Instantly applied; ICS
updated.

Provider proposes moving shoot from Sat 10am to Sun 2pm:

Buyer must Accept/Decline; if decline, original remains; provider can
counter or cancel under policy.

Provider realizes commute is shorter; waives travel fee:

Applies immediately; buyer notified; escrow reduced; new receipt issued.

Buyer asks for 10 extra edited photos after the shoot:

Provider uses Add Extras → Buyer accepts → card charged → escrow up;
addendum stored.

Provider wants to upgrade to "Premium Package" price:

Sends Custom Offer Amendment → Buyer accepts → incremental charge;
deliverables updated; new PDF.

Shoot ended early (90 min vs 2 hours):

Provider issues partial refund (30 minutes); buyer notified; payout
reduced accordingly.

11\) Acceptance Criteria (QA)

Provider can initiate all actions above from "Manage Booking" with no
admin.

Consent rules enforced exactly as in matrix; autoapprove honored.

Amendments generated, versioned, and esigned where applicable; PDFs
attached.

Escrow & fees recompute correctly for increases/decreases and
afterpayout adjustments.

Locks prevent lastminute unilateral changes; proposals respect windows.

Calendars/ICS and notifications update on acceptance.

Audit trail shows who changed what, when, and why.

Abuse controls (caps, cooldowns, score impact) function.

12\) Why this works

Providers get full operational control (no support tickets).

Buyers retain consent over anything that costs them more or gives them
less.

The platform keeps money math and contracts accurate---minimizing
disputes.

Autoapprove rules + locks make the system fast but safe.

Addendum to §1.4 --- Storage & Deliverables (Large Files, External
Hosting, Feasibility) --- FINAL

Goal: Support professional photo/video delivery (including sets in the
tens/hundreds of GB) without the platform bearing heavy storage/egress
costs. Keep acceptance/disputes solid by capturing verifiable manifests
and reviewquality previews.

A\) Storage Model (Launch)

Hybrid by design

Small assets to platform (review quality): thumbnails, contact sheets,
lowres proxy video, PDFs; typical perfile cap ≤ 500 MB.

Originals offplatform (required for large sets): Google Drive, Dropbox,
OneDrive, Box, S3 presigned links owned by the provider.

External Delivery Modes (supported at launch)

OAuthconnected mode (preferred): Provider links Drive/Dropbox once. We
fetch file lists/metadata (name, size, modified, MIME, share URL),
generate a manifest and pin it to the booking.

Linkonly mode (no OAuth): Provider pastes share links (folder or file).
We crawl the listing (where permitted), and store a readonly manifest
(names/sizes/paths).

Checksum support: For platformuploaded items we compute hash; for
externals we store content length + etag (if available). Provider can
optionally paste SHA256 for each final file; we store/compare.

Review Previews (onplatform)

Photos: autogenerated webres JPEGs (e.g., long edge 2048px) for client
review.

Video: lowres proxy transcodes (e.g., 720p) for spotchecking length/cut;
no original uploads required.

Watermark policy: Watermarks allowed on previews; finals must be
watermarkfree (autocheck).

Retention & Liability

Platform stores previews + manifests for 365 days; not a longterm
archive.

Providers must keep external links intact for at least 30 days
postacceptance (and until dispute window closes); after that, retention
is their responsibility per contract.

Security & Access

Accepts tokenized share links and/passwordprotected links (password
stored encrypted).

We never mirror entire external folders by default. Limited, ephemeral
caching is allowed for preview generation only.

B\) Delivery Room Rules (updated)

Manifest is truth: Acceptance/disputes reference the pinned manifest
(counts/specs/filenames/sizes).

Spec autochecks: Count, MIME/codec, pixel dimensions, bitrate/duration,
color profile; flags must be cured before acceptance or go to dispute.

"All finals delivered" toggle: Provider asserts completeness; system
validates against manifest.

C\) Provider Responsibilities (contractual)

Keep external links accessible through the review & dispute windows.

Supply accurate manifests and, where feasible, checksums.

Ensure clientready files are present in the deliverables folder at
acceptance.

D\) Feasibility Notes (devlight)

OAuth scopes limited to readonly file metadata + download of preview
proxies; no destructive scopes.

Linkonly works dayone; OAuth can phase in.

For Drive/Dropbox API quotas, we ratelimit and cache manifests; fallback
to manual manifest upload if provider blocks API access.

E\) Acceptance Criteria

External delivery required for files \> 500 MB; platform generates and
pins manifests.

Preview generation for photos & proxies for video; watermark detection
on finals.

Retention banners & responsibilities shown; acceptance blocked if
required links are missing.

OAuth + linkonly ingestion; secure storage of tokens/passwords; no bulk
mirroring.

SubSection 1.5 --- Trust, Safety & Verification

Goal: Give every user confidence to book and meet new
collaborators---safely, transparently, and with minimal friction---while
protecting the marketplace from abuse, fraud, and policy risk. This spec
covers user verifications, badges, safety features, moderation,
enforcement, and operations.

A\) Principles

Safety first, friction last: Strong protections with the fewest possible
extra steps.

Visible trust: Clear verification badges and reputation signals where
users make decisions (search cards, profile headers, checkout).

Evidence by default: Contracts, chat logs, checkins, and delivery
artifacts form a reliable record for disputes and incident response.

Least privilege: Share the minimum personal info needed; keep private
data private.

Consistency: Predictable policies, transparent outcomes, and auditable
decisions.

B\) Policy Scope & User Eligibility

Age: Platform is 18+ only at launch (simplifies compliance and content
policies).

Geography: US launch; future locales require local backgroundcheck
availability and legal review.

Prohibited Conduct: Harassment, discrimination, hate, threats, illegal
activity, sexual services, escorting, doxxing, offplatform payment
solicitation, explicit sexual content onsite, intellectualproperty
violations.

Allowed Content (launch): SFW + artistic nudity with NSFW gating;
explicit sexual content disallowed onplatform. (Users may link to
external sites but uploaded media must comply.)

illegal items.

NSFW toggle required where applicable; autodetection queues borderline
content for human review.

E2. Review Integrity

Reviews allowed only after completed bookings.

Noshow participants can still be reviewed with a system label ("Noshow
reported by counterparty").

Reports against reviews trigger moderation (defamation, irrelevance,
hate). Uphold facts tied to bookings.

E3. Enforcement Ladder

Education & warning

Temporary feature limits (DM caps, Instant Book disabled)

Timeboxed suspension

Removal and device/account ban

Strike policy: late cancels, noshows, policy violation content/messages;
expiry after X months.

F\) Fraud, Risk & Account Integrity

geolocation, velocity checks, mismatched card/name signals.

KYC for payouts: ID Verified + bank account name matching.

Hold & reserves: Higher reserve or payout delay for new/untrusted
accounts, relaxing with reputation.

Duplicate accounts / ban evasion: Device & identity correlation; block
on detection.

Chargeback defense: Autoassemble evidence packet (contracts, chat,
checkins, deliverables logs).

Anticircumvention: Heuristic detection of offplatform payments →
warnings → throttles → suspensions for repeat.

G\) Operations Playbook (internal)

Triage Matrix:

Safety & abuse (SLA fast) → specialized agents

Content moderation → queue with priority for NSFW edge cases

ID/Background verifications → automated + manual exceptions

Fraud/chargebacks → risk team with template evidence

Evidence Retention:

Booking artifacts (contracts, chat logs, checkins, deliverables
manifest) retained 12--24 months; extend on dispute.

PII access limited to T&S and finance staff via rolebased permissions.

Transparency & Appeals:

Users get a decision summary for major actions (what policy, what
evidence).

Appeals allowed once per action except for extreme cases (e.g., verified
criminal activity onplatform).

H\) Incentives that Make Safety "Pay"

Search boost tiers: ID Verified \> SocialVerified \> Trusted Pro
(highest).

DM credit boosts: +5 (phone), +10 (ID), unlimited newconversation
credits for Trusted Pro.

Fee perks (from §1.3): small provider fee reduction for Trusted Pro;
Instant Book discount.

Feature unlocks: Instant Book requires ID Verified; Autoaccept + Smart
Invites require ID Verified (and higher limits for Trusted Pro).

social posts)

Inthread identity recheck (selfie prompt) for suspicious flows

City "safe studios" network curation and promotion

Verified reference letters (offplatform clients/agencies with proof)

K\) Metrics & Alarms (what we measure)

Trust adoption: % ID Verified, % Trusted Pro, % SocialVerified

Safety outcomes: incident rate per 100 bookings, average timetotriage,
repeat offender rate

Reliability: cancellation/noshow rates, ontime rates, response time
medians

Fraud: chargeback rate, offplatform attempt rate, duplicate account hits

Impact: uplift in booking conversion for verified vs nonverified;
dispute rates by verification tier

Guardrail alarms: Incident spike over baseline, surge in offplatform
attempts, sudden drop in verification pass rates, abnormal dispute
clustering.

L\) Acceptance Criteria (for engineering & ops)

Badge system live with Email/Phone/2FA, ID, Background, Social, Studio,
Reference statuses and UI tooltips.

Search filters & ranking incorporate verification tiers and reliability
signals.

NSFW gating + automoderation for uploads/messages; human review queue
operational.

Safety Flag → highpriority triage with suppression of Instant Book for
accused until triage.

Checkin/out timestamps; optional generalarea pin; privacy defaults
respected.

Enforcement ladder & strike counters with expirations; audit log of
actions.

Risk scoring, payout holds/reserves for new accounts; KYC gating before
payouts.

Evidence retention and export for disputes/chargebacks.

Safety Center content published; support SLA timers visible to ops.

M\) Why this will work

Visible trust reduces hesitation and increases conversion.

ID/Background checks + contracts make inperson shoots feel professional
and safe.

Automoderation + incentives keep money onplatform and lower support
load.

Evidencefirst approach shrinks dispute duration and chargeback loss.

Addendum to §1.5 (Trust)\
Trust, Safety & Verification

Recommendation: Insert these as new subsections after your existing
verification stack and safety features (e.g., §1.5.G → §1.5.K). Leave
any search UI behavior in §1.2; keep definitions, badges, scoring,
safety flows here.

§1.5.G Studio & Location Verification

Studio Verified (badge): owner uploads address + supporting document
(lease/utility/biz registration). Staff performs a onetime check. Badge
appears on profile; exposed to search as "Studio access: verified."

Booking Location Verification (optional at checkout):

If buyer selects a known verified studio, no extra step.

Private addresses remain private; after acceptance, provider may request
location verification (lightweight place check). If unresolvable, show a
warning to both parties.

Touring calendar (from §1.2 travel): pairs well with verified studios
for safer first meetings.

§1.5.H References

Verified References (auto): created from completed onplatform bookings
(role + date). Contribute to reputation score.

Community References (optional): past collaborators can submit a
reference; recipient must approve; platform lightverifies metadata
(e.g., linked post/file). Lower weight; clearly labeled.

Search tiein: §1.2 exposes "Has verified references (≥ N)" filter.

§1.5.I Reputation Score (0--100)

Purpose: oneglance confidence, without replacing detailed info.

Formula v1 (roleaware, timeweighted):

Reviews & volume (rolespecific) --- 40%

Reliability (ontime, completion, noshow, dispute rate) --- 25%

Responsiveness (median first response time; consistency) --- 10%

Verifications (ID, Background, SocialVerified, Studio) --- 15%

Recent performance (last 90 days) --- 10%\
Negative events (late cancels, noshows, dispute losses) reduce sharply
and decay over time.

Display:

Score ring + "Why this score?" breakdown.

Rolespecific and overall values (use role score in role search).

New users show "New --- building reputation" (no penalty for being new).

Search tiein: §1.2 adds Min Rep Score filter and Top Reputation sort;
Rep used as tiebreaker after core relevance factors.

Gaming protections: weight by review volume and recency; cap any one
factor; monitor anomalies.

§1.5.J Safety Expansions

🔁 CrossReferences & Placement Notes

Keep API feasibility and platform lists under §1.2 (they power search
filters and profile chips).

Keep verification badge definitions, References, Reputation, and Safety
under §1.5; §1.2 only describes how search uses those signals.

Paid Boosting: you added it here for visibility (good); the commercial
model, pricing, caps, and governance will be fully specified later in
Monetization & Growth. §1.2 only defines how boosted results render
inside search (fairness rules).

content facilitated or hosted).

Acceptance criteria

Safe Mode default; age gate; explicitcontent detection in uploader;
rapid enforcement flows.

Addendum --- §1.5 Trust & Safety (Studios) --- FINAL

Goal: Define clear, studiospecific safety, verification, privacy, and
policy rules that protect buyers, hosts, and talent---without diluting
our artisticonly content policy or Safe Mode behavior. Keep enforcement
predictable and tooling light.

A\) Policy Scope & Definitions (Studios)

Studio = Space Listing (placebased). Trust controls apply to the space,
not a person's role.

Host = Account owner of a Studio listing.

Buyer = The party renting the studio (may be a brand, photographer, or
creator).

Artisticonly policy applies to all bookings: onplatform bookings may
include artistic nudity; explicit sexual content/acts are prohibited (no
adult content production facilitated or booked through the platform).

B\) What We Verify (Studio Lite)

Address & Ownership/RighttoRent: government/utility/lease doc + name
match; geocode/place match.

Basic Safety Disclosures: max occupancy, egress, rules summary (noise,
strobe, haze, open flame, ladders).

Host Identity: host must be IDVerified; background checks (Trusted Pro)
remain peoplerole only.

Badge: passing shows Verified Studio.

Note: Studio Lite is not a building inspection or insurance substitute;
it's a light authenticity & disclosure check.

C\) Required Documents & Gating (per booking)

Smart Docs autoattach for Studio bookings:

Property/Space Release (host ↔ buyer)

House Rules (host authored; standardized fields)

Safety Addendum (if strobe/haze/open flame indicated)

Esign before checkin: access instructions (door code) unlock only after
signatures.

Minors: if talent under 18, Minor/Guardian Release required (already in
§3.5/§3.7); studios can display "No minors" if host policy forbids.

D\) Safe Mode & Visibility

Safe Mode (18+) affects people profiles and feed content, not studio
visibility.

Studio photos and copy must remain SFW (no explicit imagery). It's
acceptable to reference "suitable for fineart nude photography" if
aligned with policy.

E\) OnSite Safety & Conduct (baseline)

Arrival & Checkin: geofenced checkin/out required for dispute
protection.

Chaperones: allowed unless host rules prohibit (hosts must state policy
clearly).

Boundaries: all onset conduct must respect talent boundaries and house
rules; harassment → immediate removal & Safety action.

Loadin/out & Crew Limit: must be honored; overages handled via
PostBooking Adjustment workflow.

Prohibited: explicit sexual acts, hate content, weapons discharge,
pyrotechnics (unless permitted & declared), illegal substances.

F\) Privacy, Cameras & Sensitive Areas

Surveillance disclosure required: hosts must disclose all cameras (fixed
or smart).

No cameras in bathrooms, dressing/makeup rooms, or other private
areas---strict violation.

Consent signage: if any camera is present in a nonprivate area, host
must display a "recording in progress" sign.

Audio recording: must be disclosed; recording conversations without
consent is prohibited where unlawful.

G\) Access, Security & Emergency

Access methods: keypad/concierge/hostmeet; share instructions
postsigning.

Emergency contact: host phone provided postbooking; platform emergency
contact tile present in thread for P0 safety use.

Incident triage: Safety P0 (threat, medical, harassment) → immediate
hotline; IB & boosts suppressed pending review.

H\) Hazard & SpecialUse Disclosures

Required rule toggles: strobe, haze/fog, loud audio, open flame,
ladders/scaffolds, wet floors, heavy props.

If toggled: Smart Docs adds Safety Addendum & checklist; buyer must
acknowledge and assume responsibility to follow posted procedures.

Open flame/pyro: disallowed unless local permits uploaded (attachment
field) and host allows.

I\) Accessibility & Accuracy

Accessibility attributes: stepfree access, elevator, restroom type, door
widths, parking.

Hosts must not misrepresent accessibility; repeated inaccuracies →
listing suppression and strike.

J\) Insurance & Deposits (clarity)

We do not provide insurance at launch. Hosts may require a COI upload
(optional field in booking thread).

Damage deposit (card hold): explained to buyer prepay; captured only on
approved claim (per §3.1/§3.9).

No platform fee on deposit captures; abuse (frivolous claims) →
penalties.

K\) AntiDiscrimination & Inclusion

Standard marketplace antidiscrimination applies to studio access
(protected classes).

Service animals: must be allowed where legally required; disclosure
needed for allergysensitive environments.

L\) Enforcement & Strikes (studiospecific)

Strikeworthy: hidden cameras / privatearea cameras, undisclosed
surveillance, unsafe conditions knowingly concealed, explicit content
facilitation, repeated access failures, repeated misrepresentation of
amenities/accessibility.

Interim measures: Instant Book disable, paid promotion suppression,
search throttling.

Remedies: require listing edits, additional disclosures, or verification
recheck.

Removal: severe or repeated violations → delist studio and potential
account suspension.

M\) Safety UX Hooks (lightweight)

Preshoot tips injected to the thread 24h prior ("Bring a chaperone if
preferred," "Share trusted contact," "Review house rules").

Trusted contact link: share session times & generalarea location with a
designated contact (fuzzed to 100--150m).

Safety banner on studio detail page: "Read House Rules & emergency exit
info on arrival."

N\) Acceptance Criteria (mark §1.5 addendum FINAL)

Studio Lite verification requirements documented and enforced
(address/righttorent + disclosures + host ID).

Smart Docs (Property/Space Release, House Rules, Safety Addendum when
applicable) autoattach; esign gating before access.

Safe Mode leaves studios visible; studio media SFWonly enforced in
uploader/moderation.

Surveillance & privacy rules enforced: disclosure required; no cameras
in private areas; signage for any recording.

Hazard toggles present; Safety Addendum injected when toggled; pyro/open
flame restricted without permits.

Accessibility fields added; misrepresentation enforcement path defined.

Emergency hooks (hotline, oncall), IB/boost suppression during
investigations.

Enforcement ladder (strike types, interim measures, removal)
implemented.

KB updates: "Studio Lite verification," "House Rules & Property
Release," "Cameras & privacy," "Hazards & permits," "Deposits & claims,"
"Artisticonly policy for studios."

O\) Why this works

Clear, minimal, enforceable: focuses on truths we can verify (address,
rules, cameras, hazards), not subjective promises.

Protects users & brand: artisticonly boundary, privacy rules, and strike
ladder guard against the highestrisk scenarios.

Lowlift ops: Lite verification + templated docs + hazard toggles keep
support scalable while giving buyers predictable safety signals.

SubSection 1.6 --- Support, Help Center & Knowledge Base

Goal: Resolve user issues fast, fairly, and consistently---with the
lowest support overhead possible. Blend selfserve (knowledge base,
guided flows, inproduct smart prompts) with human support that's
roleaware (Model/Photographer/Videographer/Creator), bookingaware, and
safetyfirst.

A\) Principles

Selfserve first: Articles, guided troubleshooters, and contextual
prompts resolve 70%+ without tickets.

Inthread resolution: Most issues are solved inside the booking thread
(refunds, extras, schedule changes) via action cards, not email
pingpong.

Safety & money prioritized: Safety; payment capture/escrow;
noshow/cancellation; disputes get elevated handling.

One source of truth: Contracts, chat, amendments, deliverables, and
receipts are the evidence for decisions.

Consistency over heroics: Clear policies, macros, and audit trails keep
outcomes predictable and defensible.

B\) UserFacing Support Channels

Help Center (web + mobile web)

Public, SEOfriendly articles; rolefiltered navigation; search with
synonyms and typotolerance.

"Was this helpful?" feedback; related articles; contact support CTA if
unresolved.

InProduct Help Widget

Contextual launcher on key pages (Search, Profile editor, Checkout,
Messaging/Project Panel).

Surfaces top articles + guided flows (see §C).

Booking Thread → "Get help"

One tap opens guided issue forms that preattach the booking ID and
autopulls context (policy chosen, timestamps, files exchanged).

Safety Flag lives here too (escalates directly to T&S).

Email form (fallback)

Web form that collects role, booking ID, category, severity; captures
device + browser autometadata.

(No phone support at launch; consider for enterprise later.)

C\) Guided Flows (Decision Trees)

Purpose: Solve or autoprepare the case before an agent sees it.

Payments & Payouts

"Charge failed" → suggest retry/readd method → if still failing, create
ticket tagged BILLING with last 4 of card, error code.

"Where is my payout?" → show payout timeline & status → if past SLA,
open PAYOUTDELAY with booking and bankonfile.

Reschedule/Cancel

Walks buyer/provider through policy windows; if within selfserve rules,
triggers Reschedule or Cancel action card directly.

If outofpolicy, collects reason and evidence → creates EXCEPTIONREQUEST.

Noshow/Late

Collects proof (checkin/out, chat logs); autocomputes default outcome
per policy; if contested, opens DISPUTE with attached evidence.

Deliverables/Quality

For missing finals: prompts provider to upload; starts a 24--48h timer;
opens MISSINGDELIVERABLES if timer expires.

For quality complaints: gathers specifics (what vs. agreed); suggests
partial settlement; creates QUALITYDISPUTE if unresolved.

Verification

ID verification help (photo tips, doc types); retries; escalates
IDVMANUALREVIEW only if necessary.

Background check status and rescreen schedule.

Account/Safety

Harassment/abuse → SAFETYPRIORITY; throttles accused user's Instant Book
automatically until triage.

Takedown (copyright/defamation) → structured DMCA/CONTENTREPORT intake.

Section 2 --- GotoMarket & City Launch Plan

Expanding the business city by city requires a structured go-to-market
strategy combined with a detailed launch plan for each new location.
Successful geographic expansion is grounded in clear metrics, phased
milestones, and effective knowledge transfer to local teams. In this
section, we outline a comprehensive plan for entering new cities, from
initial market research through post-launch optimization, ensuring each
launch is executed efficiently and sets the stage for sustainable
growth.

2.1 Market Research & City Selection

Before committing to any city launch, we will conduct in-depth market
research to select the right city and prepare a data-driven entry
strategy. Key factors to research include:

Local Market Demographics: Understand the target city's population
characteristics and customer segments to ensure our product resonates
with local needs.

Competitive Landscape: Identify existing competitors or alternatives in
the city and benchmark their offerings and market share. This analysis
will highlight gaps we can fill and help position our service
effectively.

Regulatory and Legal Requirements: Check for any city-specific licenses,
permits, or regulations that could affect operations. For example, some
cities may require special permits for our services that we don't need
in current markets, and we must secure these in advance to launch
legally and smoothly.

Operational Fit: Assess whether our current business model and processes
will work in the new city, or if we need adaptations. This is especially
crucial for an expansion into a very different market or culture.

In addition to the above, financial viability will be evaluated for each
potential city. We will forecast the launch and operating costs versus
projected revenues to ensure the expansion makes economic sense. Only
cities that show a healthy opportunity (sufficient target customers and
manageable competitive pressure) will be chosen for launch.

Upfront preparation is also critical. Prior to expansion, we will
establish a clear set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and document
standard processes as the foundation for all city launches. These KPIs
(e.g. customer acquisition rate, monthly active users, local revenue,
etc.) define what success looks like in a new city. They enable us to
set measurable milestones for the launch (such as acquiring a certain
number of users or providers within the first 3 months). By having a
predefined KPI framework and playbook, we ensure each city launch is
measured consistently and can be managed against the same performance
benchmarks. Thorough documentation of processes (and automation where
possible) will allow rapid knowledge transfer to new teams and maintain
consistency as we replicate our model in different locales.\
\
2.2 Launch Team & Local Operations Setup

To execute the city launch plan effectively, we will deploy a dedicated
city launch team and set up local operations in advance. Rather than
expecting each new city to figure things out independently, a specialist
launch team from the company will temporarily relocate to spearhead the
launch on the ground. This team may include experienced members from our
existing operations along with specialists (e.g. marketing, community
managers) who focus on new launches. Crucially, the team will include a
recruiter or HR lead who arrives about six weeks early in the target
city to start lining up local hires before the official launch period.
Hiring a local city manager and key operational staff in advance ensures
that when we launch, we have people who know the area and can eventually
take over daily operations.

During the initial weeks in a new city, the launch team will handle
tasks like securing any physical requirements (for example, a small
local office or storage facility if needed) and ensuring all logistics
and regulatory prerequisites are in place. This includes confirming
local permits or licenses have been obtained (as identified in the
research phase) and setting up any local partnerships or vendor
relationships needed for operations (e.g. local supply vendors,
last-mile logistics, etc.). Compliance with city regulations and laws
will be a priority before launch day, so that we enter the market on the
right side of local requirements.

We recognize that hiring the right local talent is pivotal to success in
a new market. The local team will ultimately run the city's operations
after the launch team leaves, so we will take care to recruit
high-quality, proactive individuals who can operate with some autonomy.
Especially if the new city is far from headquarters, we need employees
who are self-starters and don't require constant hand-holding. We will
not rush the hiring process or settle for sub-par candidates simply to
fill positions quickly; bringing on the right people (even if it takes a
bit more time) will pay off in smoother operations and better growth
post-launch. The recruiter on the launch team will focus on assembling
this local team early, so they can train alongside the launch experts
during the rollout period.

In summary, our go-to-market plan calls for a skilled launch taskforce
to establish each new city, build out local operations, and hand over a
well-functioning business to a carefully hired local team. By
front-loading the operational setup and knowledge transfer, we set each
city up with the tools, people, and processes it needs to thrive from
day one.

2.3 Localized Marketing & Customer Acquisition Strategy

A one-size-fits-all marketing approach will not work for city launches
--- each new city requires a localized go-to-market strategy tailored to
its audience and culture. Our marketing plan for city launches will
combine overarching brand messaging with hyper-local tactics to quickly
build awareness and user adoption in the new market.

First, we will leverage digital marketing targeted to the specific city.
This includes geo-targeted online ads (social media, search engines)
focused on the city's residents, and localized content on our website or
app store listings highlighting why our product/service is a great fit
for that city. We will also pursue local media coverage and PR
opportunities (press releases, local news features) to announce our
launch and explain the unique value we bring to the community.

Beyond digital channels, on-the-ground and community-focused marketing
will be key. We plan to engage in grassroots promotion such as
city-specific launch events, pop-up demos, or sponsorships. For example,
if launching a new service in a city, we might host a launch day event
or partner with a popular local festival to showcase our offering.
Forming partnerships with local businesses or influencers can greatly
accelerate word-of-mouth. One proven tactic is to go directly where our
target customers already congregate. For instance, when Oatly expanded
into a new market, they bypassed generic ads and partnered with local
coffee shops to reach their ideal customers at the point of purchase, a
strategy credited with helping their product gain rapid adoption (10x
revenue growth in one year). We will identify similar win-win
partnership opportunities in each city (whether it's coffee shops,
community centers, universities, or other venues relevant to our target
demographic) to embed our product into the local lifestyle from the
start.

Our customer acquisition playbook in each city will be experimental and
responsive to local feedback. Each city has a unique culture and what
works in one market may not work in another. To account for this, we
will be prepared to test and iterate on marketing channels quickly.
Early in the launch, the team will test a range of channels -- e.g.
social media campaigns, flyer distributions in high-traffic areas,
referral incentives, collaborations with local influencers -- and double
down on those that show traction. As one startup founder notes from
experience, it's important to "cycle through different customer
acquisition approaches because every new market is different", and to
spend time on the ground learning "what makes a city tick" by seeing
things from the local's perspective. In practice, this could mean our
team spends the first couple of weeks immersing in the city's daily
life, talking to potential users, and understanding their needs and
habits.

We will also deploy creative grassroots tactics to spark initial
word-of-mouth. For example, one company found success by physically
going to a local flea market right after launch and pitching their
product directly to shoppers who fit their target profile, essentially
bringing the product to the customer at a point of need. In our case,
we'll seek out comparable opportunities (whether it's attending meetups,
weekend markets, or neighborhood events) to personally introduce our
service to early adopters. Such high-touch efforts not only drive early
user sign-ups but also show the community that we are invested and
engaged locally.

All these marketing efforts will be coordinated to create a surge of
awareness and adoption around the launch period. We aim to achieve a
critical mass of users in the first weeks, which will attract further
users through network effects and social proof. By combining targeted
digital campaigns with on-the-ground engagement and partnerships, our
go-to-market strategy ensures that each city launch quickly gains
momentum and establishes our brand firmly in the local market.

2.4 Launch Timeline & Milestones

Executing a city launch will be done in phases with clear timelines and
milestones to keep the team on track. We will use a milestone-based city
launch plan that breaks the process into manageable stages from
pre-launch through post-launch. Below is an outline of the launch
timeline for each city:

Pre-Launch Preparation (T-minus 6 Weeks): Approximately six weeks before
the public launch, our advance team (especially the recruiter) is on the
ground in the new city. Key activities in this phase include finalizing
local hires, securing any necessary office space or equipment, meeting
with prospective partners, and launching initial teaser marketing (e.g.
"coming soon" campaigns). By the end of this phase, we aim to have a
trained local core team in place and all major operational issues
resolved before full launch.

Launch Execution (Weeks 1--4 of Launch): This marks the official launch
period when our service becomes available in the city. The city launch
team arrives in full to execute the playbook. In the first 4 weeks, the
team focuses on hitting early milestones: onboarding initial customers
and/or service providers, ensuring service quality, and monitoring KPIs
closely (for example, reaching a target number of active users or
transactions by week 4). During this phase, the launch team works
hands-on alongside the new local hires, demonstrating processes and
solving problems in real time. We maintain a checklist of critical
milestones (e.g. system infrastructure stable, first 100 customers
acquired, first local partnership deal signed, customer satisfaction
above threshold) that should be achieved by the end of Week 4. Hitting
these targets confirms the launch is gaining traction as expected.

Knowledge Transfer & Transition (Weeks 5--10): Around week 5, once the
initial launch goals are met, the focus shifts to transferring full
operational control to the local team. From Week 5 through Week 10, the
city launch team gradually steps back while coaching the local team to
handle all aspects of the business. During this transition, standard
operating procedures are reviewed, and any local adjustments are
documented. The launch team ensures the new team is comfortable with
maintaining quality and growth. By about the tenth week, our goal is
that the local team can run the city independently, with the central
launch team only in a support role. A final review is done at Week 10 to
decide if the city is on track (meeting the KPI targets set out) and if
the launch team can fully exit to focus on the next city.

Each phase has explicit milestones and deliverables, allowing us to
track progress and address issues promptly. This milestone-based
approach creates accountability and clarity -- everyone knows what
"success" looks like at each stage of the launch. If a milestone is not
met (for example, if user acquisition falls short in Week 2-3), the team
can pause and troubleshoot or deploy additional resources to fix the
issue before proceeding. By structuring the city launch in phases, we
ensure a disciplined rollout and reduce the risk of launching without
the necessary foundations in place.

2.5 Post-Launch Monitoring & Scaling Strategy

Launching in a new city is not the end of the process -- it's the
beginning of that city's growth journey. After the initial launch and
handoff, we will have systems in place to monitor performance, support
the local team, and continuously improve our expansion playbook for
future cities.

Firstly, we will set up a city monitoring function to oversee the health
of all launched cities. This could be a small centralized team or a
regular review process that uses our KPI framework to track each city's
metrics (e.g. growth rate, revenue, customer satisfaction) against
targets. The purpose is to ensure consistency and quality across cities,
catching any post-launch issues early. We may implement standard
compliance checks or quality audits (akin to an internal "city
operations QA" program) to verify that each city is maintaining our
service standards. For example, using a common framework or dashboard,
we can compare metrics across cities to identify any outliers or best
practices. If one city is excelling in a particular area (say, very high
customer retention), those tactics can be shared with other cities.

We will also encourage an environment of continuous knowledge sharing
among city teams. As the Times of India notes, effective expansion
relies on teams being "independent as well as centrally aligned and
sharing best practices". To facilitate this, we'll hold regular
cross-city meetings or calls (for instance, a bi-weekly "city leads
sync") where city managers exchange learnings, challenges, and
successes. We will maintain an internal knowledge repository (wiki or
playbook documents) that gets updated with insights from each launch --
this may include refining checklists, marketing tactics that worked, or
pitfalls to avoid. These updates will continuously enhance our city
launch playbook. In fact, each new city provides an opportunity to
improve the model: for example, after launching in our second city, we
might refine our onboarding process or marketing strategy based on what
we learned, creating an even stronger template for the third city. Over
time, this accumulation of experience becomes a powerful asset, making
subsequent launches more predictable and efficient.

Another post-launch strategy is to foster some exchange of talent for
training and culture. We can have experienced team members from a
successful city spend time in a newer city to mentor the local team or
help instill best practices, and vice versa. This cross-pollination
ensures that our company's culture and standards are consistently
spread, and it gives rising local stars a chance to learn in different
environments.

Finally, our expansion plan will take a sustainable growth approach. We
will only scale up to the next cities when ready, rather than launching
too many cities all at once. It's important to avoid the trap of growing
too fast, too soon, which can strain resources and lead to quality
control issues. Each city launch will be evaluated against its KPIs to
ensure it's stable (operationally and financially) before we green-light
the next launch. This paced expansion prevents high cash burn and
employee burnout that can come from aggressive, uncontrolled expansion.
By making sure we have the necessary resources (funding, people,
technology) in place for each new market, we protect the quality of our
service and brand reputation as we grow.

In summary, the post-launch phase focuses on consolidating success,
maintaining standards, and preparing for the next expansion. We will
continuously monitor each city's performance and support the teams to
ensure ongoing success. Lessons learned will feed back into our
go-to-market strategy, allowing us to refine our approach with every new
city. This feedback loop and careful scaling strategy will enable us to
confidently expand our footprint city by city, while delivering a
consistent, high-quality experience in every market we serve.

Our go-to-market rollout will be executed in clearly defined phases with
measurable milestones. Phase 1 (current phase) covers our initial launch
in our first city (or region), which establishes our beachhead and
refines our core service. Assuming Section 1 covered the success of our
pilot market, we are now leveraging those learnings to expand further.
Phase 2 will consist of launching in the next set of high-priority
cities (Tier 1 markets from our selection process). We anticipate
launching in X new cities in the first 6 months of expansion, focusing
on cities that scored highest on our opportunity scorecard (for example,
\[City A\], \[City B\], and \[City C\]). These initial expansions are
milestone-driven: before moving on, we aim for each new city to achieve
key targets such as reaching Y active users and attaining a baseline
revenue or engagement level that proves local viability.

Phase 3 will expand to Tier 2 markets -- a broader set of cities once
the playbook is validated in Phase 2. In this phase (perhaps months 6-18
of the plan), we might roll out to an additional N cities each quarter,
accelerating our coverage. Here we apply our tiered strategy: some
cities might be in \"launch mode\" focusing on user acquisition and
refining unit economics, while others (including our earliest markets)
graduate to \"growth mode\". Importantly, we will set different goals
for different stages: for example, a city in its first 3 months of
launch may target customer acquisition and awareness as the primary
KPIs, whereas a city in month 12 may target repeat usage and
profitability. Our plan explicitly accounts for these stage-based goals.
As noted earlier, soft launch vs. scale stages have different success
metrics. We will not prematurely force a new market to hit the same
numbers as an established one; instead, we track its progress against
stage-appropriate milestones (e.g., by month 3 post-launch, achieve X%
customer retention and an improving LTV/CAC trend).

Throughout the timeline, we'll maintain a live roadmap of city launches
with key dates and criteria. A sample milestone plan could be:

Q1 2024: Launch in 3 cities (A, B, C). Milestone: Each reaches 5,000
users and \$50k monthly gross revenue within first 3 months.

Q2 2024: Launch in next 5 cities (D, E, F, G, H) using refined playbook.
Milestone: Reduce average customer acquisition cost by 20% versus Q1
launches.

Q3 2024: Pause new launches to consolidate and improve operations if
needed (or continue with next wave if metrics are healthy). Milestone:
Achieve overall LTV/CAC \> 1.5 in at least 5 markets as a signal of
approaching profitability.

End of 2024: 8-10 cities live. Milestone: Prove the model can scale; hit
corporate revenue target of \$X million from new markets.

(The exact numbers and cities are placeholders for planning purposes and
will be adjusted based on real-time feedback and results.) By laying out
a timeline with such milestones, we can track our progress and make
go/no-go decisions for each subsequent wave of expansion. If milestones
are met or exceeded, it's a green light to continue scaling. If we fall
short in a particular city, we will troubleshoot and improve the model
before proceeding further, ensuring we don't expand faster than we can
manage quality and performance.

Section 2.6 --- Success Metrics & Continuous Improvement

To ensure the Go-to-Market and city launch plan stays on track, we will
closely monitor success metrics and institute a cycle of continuous
improvement. Each city launch will be accompanied by a dashboard of KPIs
that measure how well our strategy is working. Key metrics include:

User acquisition metrics: number of sign-ups, activation rate (how many
of those sign-ups become active customers), and growth rate
week-over-week in the early months.

Supply-side metrics: number of service providers/partners onboarded,
their activity levels, and the supply-demand ratio (e.g. are there
enough drivers to fulfill ride requests within target wait times).

Engagement and retention: repeat usage rates, cohort retention of
customers after launch, and customer satisfaction/NPS scores in the new
city.

Unit economics: particularly LTV/CAC (Customer Lifetime Value vs.
Customer Acquisition Cost) in each city. We will track how this ratio
evolves as the city matures -- initially it may be below 1 (as we invest
in growth), but our goal is to drive it above 1 (customers become
profitable) within a defined period. Achieving a healthy LTV/CAC is a
key signal that a city can move from launch phase to growth phase.

These metrics will be reviewed frequently (weekly during the initial
launch period, then monthly as the market stabilizes). If a city is
falling behind on any KPIs, the launch team and central team will
collaborate to diagnose issues and implement fixes. Because we
anticipate variance between cities, we won't rigidly stick to an
expansion plan without adapting. As Instacart's Boston General Manager
noted regarding expansion playbooks: a playbook is extremely useful as a
starting point, but every city is so unique that one must know when to
follow the recipe and when to trust one's taste buds. In that spirit,
our team will constantly question assumptions and adjust our tactics to
local realities. Regular cross-city meetings will be held to share
lessons learned; what we learn in City A's launch will refine how we
approach City B, and so on.

We will maintain a "living" city launch playbook document that is
updated continuously. This is not a static manual, but a collection of
best practices, checklists, and learnings that the launch team can
reference and contribute to. For instance, if a particular marketing
channel (say, college campus outreach) proved highly effective in one
city, we'll note that in the playbook and consider employing it in
similar markets. Conversely, if we discover that a strategy didn't work
in a city, we'll document the context and caution for the future. The
goal is to make each subsequent launch more efficient and successful by
leveraging accumulated knowledge. As one founder described, their
playbook started as lessons from their first market and was "refined
with each city launch\... giving a solid starting point when entering
new markets". Our approach mirrors this philosophy of continuous
improvement.

Finally, success will also be measured at the macro level -- how our
multi-city expansion contributes to the company's overall growth and
market leadership. We expect that by following this GTM and city launch
plan, we will rapidly grow our user base and revenue. The ultimate
validation will be achieving dominant position in key markets. Companies
that executed disciplined expansion strategies have not only scaled to
hundreds of cities but often emerged as the category leaders in every
region they entered. We have the same ambition. By closely tracking our
metrics and iterating on our strategy, we'll ensure that our expansion
is not just rapid, but also sustainable and strategically sound, paving
the way for long-term success.

Addendum to §2 --- GotoMarket (Awareness without brand risk)

Dedicated landing page & nav tile: "For FanSubscription Creators"
explaining SFW collaboration and promo tools; policy clarity
frontandcenter.

SEO/SEM language: use "FanSubscription Creator" / "Premium Content
Creator" rather than platform brand names in paid ads (reduces adpolicy
risk).

Partner channel: outreach to reputable agencies managing fansubscription
creators; offer Founding Creator perks (reduced buyer fee on first
collaboration, free ID verify).

Proof: case studies highlighting SFW collab shoots + verified promo
deliverables (no explicit media).

Addendum A §2 GotoMarket: Studios Launch Scope & Emphasis
(ResearchUpdated)

Goal: Decide how (or if) "Studios" appears at launch without diluting
focus or overcompeting with Peerspace. Preserve our core: talent
discovery & bookings. Use studios as a complementary, lowfriction addon
that increases conversion for shoots---not a coequal vertical on day
one.

A\) Launch Positioning (what "Studios" means at MVP)

Name & framing: "Verified Studios (Lite)" --- curated creative spaces
and private studios suitable for photo/video shoots (not
events/parties).

Role in v1: Complementary to talent bookings. Studios appear as an
attachable option during briefs/checkout and as a subhub under Browse,
not a topnav pillar.

Geographic scope: Founding city only (e.g., Houston), seed 15--30
quality studios max; expand after PMF signals.

B\) Why not a full "Peerspace competitor" at launch

Focus & liquidity: Early marketplaces win by narrowing scope. A full
venue marketplace doubles complexity (supply ops, insurance, deposits,
map/amenity search, etc.).

Differentiation: Our edge is talent + tools (briefs, deliverables,
social metrics). Studios should amplify those flows (shoot readiness),
not become the main show.

Quality \> quantity: A curated set of creativeready spaces beats a thin
longtail that invites comparison to mature incumbents.

C\) What ships for Studios at MVP (scope you can build to)

Surface & discovery

Attach a Studio step in Brief and Checkout (city & date prefilled,
filter by distance/price/amenities).

Browse ▸ Verified Studios (Lite) subhub (not topnav): grid + map,
creative filters (natural light, cyc wall, blackout, ceilings, rates,
capacity).

Studio chips on talent profiles ("Has studio access" or "Owns studio")
when applicable.

Booking model

Instant Book default (host can opt "approval required"). Hourly
pricing + min hours; overtime rules.

Escrow same as talent; damage deposit (card hold) optional per host;
cleaning fee allowed; rules & access shown before pay.

Checkin/out with geofence & door code field; QR access optional later.

Verification (Lite)

Studio Lite (already designed in §3.4): doc OCR + geocode/Place match;
manual exception only.

Required docs: property/space release template + house rules
(autoattached via Smart Docs).

Payments & fees

Same 12% provider / 5% buyer baseline (see §3.1), deposit holds not
counted as GMV.

Refund matrix follows space norms (stricter latecancel terms than
talent; see matrix below).

D\) What we defer (postPMF)

Insurance marketplace, security deposits with offline inspections,
complex tiered amenities pricing, multilisting host dashboards, full
multicity inventory, eventuse cases.

Mapheavy discovery bells/whistles (streetlevel 3D tours, AR
walkthroughs).

Equipment rentals marketplace (separate future track).

E\) Studio Refund & Policy Matrix (v1 defaults; hosts may choose
stricter within bands)

Amenity overages (overtime/crew size): host may file PostBooking
Adjustments within 24h with evidence; buyer has 48h to approve/dispute.

F\) Marketplace Mechanics (how studios add conversion, not complexity)

Brief uplift: when buyer composes a shoot brief, Attach a Studio offers
3 nearby matches with "creative amenities" chips; increases award rate
by reducing buyer friction.

Talent crosssell: photographers who own a studio can toggle Studio AddOn
(hourly) inside their package; the system then exposes that studio at
checkout.

Boards: saved boards can include both talent & studios; Compare view
keeps them separated by type.

G\) Supply Seeding Playbook (first 30--60 days)

Curate 15--30 creative studios (natural light lofts, cyclorama spaces,
warehouse sets) in the founding city.

Fasttrack verification (Lite); waive Studio Lite fee for first 25.

Founding Host perks: Featured placement in Verified Studios (Lite)
carousel for 60 days; 0% buyer fee on first booking to stimulate demand.

Quality bar: professional photos required; template rules; minimum
availability posting (2+ days/week).

Partnerships: local studio associations, photo schools, production
collectives.

H\) Demand GTM Hooks

Bundle messaging: "Book the crew and the space in one place."

Saved Searches: "Talent + Studio in \[City\] this weekend" templates.

Case studies: showcase shoots that used both a Verified Studio and
onplatform talent; highlight time saved.

I\) IA & Nav Guidance (affects §4.0/§4.1 rewrites)

Browse ▸ Verified Studios (Lite) under Browse (not topnav).

Attach a Studio step in Brief/Checkout (primary place most buyers will
encounter studios).

Studio result cards use a distinct badge & amenity chips; but share card
patterns with talent for consistency.

J\) KPIs & KillSwitches (90day postlaunch)

Attachrate: ≥ 20% of shoot briefs add a studio candidate.

Studioinvolved GMV: ≥ 15% of GMV involves a studio by month 3.

Fill rate: ≥ 50% of hosted studio slots receive at least one
inquiry/week.

Incident rate: damage disputes \< 1% of studio bookings.

Killswitch: If attachrate \< 8% and studio search CTR \< 2% for 8
consecutive weeks, hide Studios from Browse and keep only Attach in
Brief/Checkout; revisit supply fit.

K\) Acceptance Criteria (mark Addendum A FINAL)

Attach a Studio step live in Brief and Checkout, prefiltered by
city/date.

Verified Studios (Lite) subhub live under Browse (grid + map); creative
amenity filters.

Studio booking: hourly + min hours, instant book default (host can
require approval), overtime rules, cleaning fee field, rules & access
surfaced prepay.

Deposits: card hold configurable per listing; damage claim flow with 24h
window.

Policies: studio cancel matrix implemented; host cancel strike/IB pause
wired.

Verification Lite flow for studios connected; property/space release
autoattached via Smart Docs.

Crosssell: studio chips on talent profiles when owned/linked; Studio
AddOn in photographer packages.

KPIs dashboards for attachrate, studio GMV share, incident rate;
killswitch automation.

L\) Why this works

Amplifies, doesn't distract: Studios boost conversion of shoots without
turning us into a venue marketplace.

Curated & creativeonly: We avoid the event/party longtail and focus on
spaces that matter to our users.

Operationally sane: Lite verification, instant book defaults, deposits,
and simple amenity filters keep v1 lean.

Option value: If traction pops, we can elevate Studios in the nav and
expand supply; if not, we gracefully tuck it behind "Attach" without
harming core flows.

SubSection 3.1 --- Core Monetization Mechanics

Goal: Monetize in ways that increase trust and throughput, not friction.
Keep pricing simple, fair, and transparent; reward the behaviors that
grow the marketplace (verification, Instant Book, reliability).

A\) What we charge (and why)

1\) Transaction (perbooking) economics

Provider fee (commission): 12% of booking subtotal (packages + extras +
license + travel).\
Why: This benchmarks lower than creator marketplaces like Collabstr
(15%), Swipecast (15%), and Peerspace host fees (15--20%), while
remaining close to Upwork's freelancer fee (10%)---so we're competitive
for launch without undercutting our margins.

Buyer service fee: 5% (min \$3); 3% when paid via ACH (once available).\
Why: Buyer fees around 5--5.5% are common on large marketplaces (e.g.,
Fiverr 5.5% + a smallorder fee), and Upwork charges 3--5% depending on
payment method/plan. Our \$3 minimum ensures we cover processing on
small bookings, and the ACH discount mirrors market norms and nudges
lowercost rails.

Processing costs: paid out of platform take (the buyer fee largely
offsets card fees at \~2.9% + \$0.30 in the U.S.; ACH is lower). Note:
card processing fees from the original transaction aren't returned on
refunds (industry standard).

Refund policy on fees:

If provider cancels or safety exception → refund buyer service fee.

If buyer cancels per policy → service fee is nonrefundable (covers
payment ops & support).

Provider fee adjusts automatically to the final job value after any
discounts/refunds.

Why this mix: Simple, predictable, and aligned with market expectations
and our earlystage unit economics. 5% buyer keeps us in line with Upwork
and below/near Fiverr's charge to buyers; 12% provider undercuts or
matches comparable verticals.

2\) Fee adjusters (nudge the right behavior)

Instant Book discount: Provider fee --1% on Instant Book transactions
(promotes "buy now").

Trusted Pro (backgroundchecked) discount: Provider fee --0.5% (rewards
safety investment).

Highvalue tiering: On the portion above \$1,000 in a single booking,
provider fee drops to 10% (keeps big jobs onplatform; echoes the "volume
discount" concept users recognize from legacy Upwork tiers).

Newmarket promos (timeboxed): e.g., \$0 buyer fee on first booking in a
launch city; or --2% provider for first 60 days postlaunch.

All discounts are stackable with a floor (e.g., provider fee floor =
9%).

3\) What we don't charge for

DMs and inquiries (within fairuse credits; see §3.2).

Tips (0% platform fee on tips, paid postcompletion)---a clear
differentiator vs. platforms that take a cut of tips.

TFP/Collab Mode (no cash) --- no commission; we monetize indirectly
(Pro, boosts).

B\) Escrow, payout timing & reserves (recap, monetization lens)

Escrow on accept/book: we hold funds until completion/milestones (see
§1.3).

Payout timing: standard 48h after completion; newprovider reserve (e.g.,
first 1--3 payouts delayed up to 7 days or 10% rolling reserve) to
reduce fraud/chargeback risk.

Early Payout (Pro preview for §3.2): selected providers with strong Rep
Score can receive same/nextday payouts for an optional 0.5%
payoutacceleration fee (applied to the provider fee component).

C\) Worked examples (realistic, stepbystep)

We keep the math explicit so Finance & Product implement identical
calculations.

Example 1 --- \$300 booking, default fees, no discounts

Booking subtotal: \$300

Buyer service fee (5%): 0.05 × 300 = \$15 → Buyer pays \$315

Provider fee (12% of \$300): 0.12 × 300 = \$36

Provider takehome (preprocessing): \$300 − \$36 = \$264

Processor cost (illustrative): assume 2.9% + \$0.30 on \$315

2.9% of 315 = \$9.135; + \$0.30 = \$9.435 (≈ \$9.44)

Platform gross on this booking (before ops):

Revenue = provider fee \$36 + buyer fee \$15 = \$51

Less processing ≈ \$9.44 → Net ≈ \$41.56.

Example 2 --- \$600 booking, Instant Book (--1%) + Trusted Pro (--0.5%)

Buyer service fee (5%): 0.05 × 600 = \$30 → Buyer pays \$630

Provider fee base (12%): \$72

Discounted provider fee (10.5%): 0.105 × 600 = \$63

Provider takehome: \$600 − \$63 = \$537

Platform revenue preprocessing: \$63 + \$30 = \$93

Processing (2.9% + \$0.30) on \$630: \$18.57

Net to platform (before ops): \$74.43.

Example 3 --- \$85 booking, smallorder check

Buyer service fee: 5% of \$85 = \$4.25 (≥ \$3 min, so min does not
apply) → buyer pays \$89.25

Provider fee (12%): \$10.20 → provider takehome \$74.80

Processing on \$89.25 (2.9% + \$0.30): ≈ \$2.89

Platform net (preops): (10.20 + 4.25) − 2.89 ≈ \$11.56

On very small bookings (e.g., \$30), the \$3 min protects margin---where
many peers set \$3--\$3.50 smallorder addons.

D\) Pricing transparency & UX rules

Oneline disclosure at checkout: "Platform fees include secure escrow,
contracts, support & payment processing."

Provider dashboard "takehome preview" per package (and optional "include
estimated card fees" toggle).

Refund/discount edits autoreissue amended receipts for both sides (see
§1.4 addendum).

City promos show strikethrough fees (e.g., "Buyer fee \~5%\~ → 0% this
month in Houston").

ACH discount labeling: clearly show "Pay by bank (save 2% on fees)" once
ACH is enabled; this mirrors buyerside fee reductions on comparable
platforms.

E\) Antileakage incentives (why pay through us)

Protection value: escrow, platform contracts/releases, dispute handling,
verified reviews, Pro analytics.

Economics: lower provider fee for Instant Book and Trusted Pro;
eligibility for paid Search Boost gated by onplatform performance.

Friction: gentle inchat warnings on offplatform payment attempts; repeat
attempts throttle newconversation sends (see §1.4/§1.5).

F\) Edge cases & policy notes

Dispute outcomes: platform retains the buyer fee only when buyer is at
fault; if we rule for the buyer due to provider fault, we refund the
buyer fee (mirrors common guest/host fee treatments).

Chargebacks: a disputehandling fee (e.g., \$15) may be charged to the
losing party only in clear abuse; otherwise we absorb processor dispute
fees.

Taxes: where services are taxable, fees are calculated on the taxable
base appropriately; receipts itemize taxes separately.

NSFW policy alignment: mainstreamfirst (artistic nudity allowed),
enabling mainstream processors and avoiding adultcontent
surcharges/payout friction.

Refunds & processor fees: card processing fees on the original
transaction are not returned by processors; our policy and tooling
reflect this.

G\) Acceptance criteria (to mark 3.1 FINAL)

Fee engine supports 12% provider + 5% buyer (min \$3); ACH buyer fee 3%;
stackable discounts (Instant Book −1%, Trusted Pro −0.5%, 10% on portion
\> \$1,000) with floor 9%.

Buyer fee refunded on providerfault cancellations/safety exceptions;
nonrefundable on buyerinitiated cancels.

Payouts: 48h standard; newprovider reserve policy configurable by
cohort; Early Payout addon ready for §3.2.

Receipts/invoices autoupdate after amendments/discounts; totals
consistent with escrow.

Provider dashboard shows takehome preview; checkout shows clear fee
blurb + tooltip; ACH discount is surfaced when available.

Analytics capture net platform revenue per booking, fee mix, and impact
of discounts on conversion.

H\) Why this works (postresearch)

Marketaligned: 12% provider sits below or near sector peers (15%+ on
Collabstr/Swipecast/Peerspace; Fiverr takes 20% from sellers), while 5%
buyer with \$3 min mirrors buyer fees at Fiverr/Upwork.

Profitable from day one: buyer fee largely covers card processing;
smallorder min prevents negative unit economics; ACH discount reduces
payment costs and attracts highervalue buyers.

Growthpositive: discounts for Instant Book and Trusted Pro increase
conversion and safety; highvalue tier encourages larger jobs to stay
onplatform (a pattern users recognize from legacy fee ladders).

Addendum to §3.1 / §3.2 --- Policy & Pricing Notes (Storage & Docs)

Storage policy copy (customerfacing): "We store review copies and
paperwork for 12 months. Originals stay in your Drive/Dropbox. We're not
a longterm archive."

No storage fees at launch (per §3.2 StartFree strategy); external
hosting required for large deliverables.

Document access: Signed docs are always downloadable; we maintain copies
even if external links expire.

Dispute window: Contracts define a posting/delivery dispute window
(e.g., 7--14 days) during which links must remain live.

Addendum --- §3.1 Core Monetization Mechanics (Studios) --- FINAL

Goal: Apply our simple, trusted pricing (12% provider / 5% buyer) to
Studio bookings without ambiguity. Keep deposits outside GMV, align
refunds with studio policies, and preserve clean ledgers for Linked
Booking Groups (talent + studio in one checkout).

A\) What we charge on a Studio booking

Provider (host) fee: 12% of the studio subtotal

Subtotal = hourly rental × booked hours + cleaning fee + paid addons
(e.g., furniture move)

Excludes taxes and deposit holds.

Buyer service fee: 5% of the studio subtotal (min \$3)

ACH discount (when enabled): buyer fee 3% (min \$3) if the buyer pays
via ACH.

Refund of buyer fee follows fault: refunded on hostfault cancel;
nonrefundable on buyer cancel per policy.

Processing costs: paid from platform take (same as talent).

No change to talent fees. Talent and Studio fees are computed on their
respective subtotals, even when purchased together.

B\) Discounts & nudges (studio)

Instant Book discount applies to Studio bookings: --1% on the provider
fee for IB transactions.

Trusted Pro (background) is peopleonly; does not apply to Studio hosts.

Highvalue tier: the 10% provider fee above \$1,000 threshold applies per
booking (talent and studio evaluated separately).

City promos (timeboxed) may separately reduce buyer/provider fees on
studio bookings; configured per city cohort.

C\) What we do not charge on studios

Damage deposits (card holds) are not GMV; we do not take a platform fee
on deposit captures.

Postbooking damage captures (if approved) pass through to host; the
platform may still incur processor fees.

Tips (if we enable them for hosts) remain 0% platform fee.

D\) Adjustments that are feeable

Overtime, crewsize overages, ruleviolation fees (when upheld) are
treated as booking adjustments → included in studio subtotal and feeable
at the same provider/buyer fee rates.

Change orders that extend hours or add paid items → feeable (computed at
approval time).

E\) Linked Booking Groups (talent + studio in one checkout)

We create two bookings (one talent, one studio) under a Linked Group ID.

Fees are computed per booking; buyer sees a unified receipt with two
sections (Talent • Studio).

Refunds/reversals apply per booking based on each policy; the group
summary presents the net outcome.

Processing may be a single charge or split under the hood; the ledger
remains separated to keep fee math transparent.

F\) Refund policy alignment (studio vs talent)

Studio cancels (hostfault): 100% refund of studio charges; buyer service
fee for that booking refunded; goodwill credit per §3.9.

Buyer cancels: follow the studio matrix (e.g., \>7 days = 100%, 7--48h =
50%, \<48h = 0%); buyer fee nonrefundable.

Noshow (buyer at studio): host paid per matrix; buyer fee nonrefundable.

Force majeure/safety: platform may waive fees and refund appropriately
(studio and/or talent) per §3.9.

G\) Worked examples (clear math)

Processor assumption: \~2.9% + \$0.30 per charge (illustrative). We show
platform preprocessing revenue and an approx net after processing for
transparency.

Example 1 --- Studioonly booking

Rate: \$100/hr × 4h = \$400

Cleaning fee: \$40 → Studio subtotal = \$440

Buyer fee (5%): 0.05 × 440 = \$22.00 → Buyer pays = \$462.00

Provider fee (12%): 0.12 × 440 = \$52.80 → Host takehome (preprocessing)
= 440 − 52.80 = \$387.20

Platform revenue (preprocessing) = provider fee \$52.80 + buyer fee
\$22.00 = \$74.80

Processing (est.) on \$462: 2.9% × 462 = \$13.398 ≈ \$13.40; + \$0.30 =
\$13.70

Approx net to platform = 74.80 − 13.70 = \$61.10

Deposit hold: \$300 authorization (not charged, not GMV)

Example 2 --- Linked Group: Talent \$600 + Studio from Ex.1 (no
discounts)

Talent booking

Subtotal \$600 → Buyer fee (5%) \$30.00; Provider fee (12%) \$72.00

Platform preproc rev \$102.00; processing (est. on \$630) \$18.57 → net
≈ \$83.43

Studio booking (from Ex.1)

Platform net ≈ \$61.10

Combined (informational)

Platform preproc = \$102.00 + \$74.80 = \$176.80

Approx processing total ≈ \$18.57 + \$13.70 = \$32.27

Approx net ≈ \$144.53

Buyer sees two buyerfee lines (talent \$30, studio \$22) and a single
receipt with two sections.

If Instant Book applies to talent and/or studio, reduce the respective
provider fee(s) by 1%; math updates accordingly. ACH payment would
reduce the buyer fee(s) to 3% where used.

H\) Chargebacks & deposit captures (studio specifics)

Representment for studio chargebacks includes: checkin/out logs, rules
acceptance, houserules esign, before/after photos, and adjustment
evidence.

Deposit capture (after approved damage claim) is a separate charge; no
platform fee applied; we still prepare evidence and may incur processor
dispute fees.

Repeated abusive claims by hosts or buyers trigger Rep penalties and
eligibility throttles (IB off, boost suppress).

I\) Citybycity knobs (monetization safety)

Configure studioonly promos (e.g., 0% buyer fee on first studio booking
in founding city).

Optionally waive Studio Lite verification fee for first 25--50
hosts/city (CAC budget), not a permanent policy.

Keep provider fee floor = 9% after all discounts (applies independently
to talent and studio).

J\) Acceptance Criteria (mark §3.1 addendum FINAL)

Provider 12% / Buyer 5% applied to Studio subtotal (cleaning/addons
included; taxes/deposits excluded).

IB --1% discount applies to Studio; Trusted Pro does not (peopleonly);
\>\$1k tier reduces Studio fee portion to 10%.

Buyer fee refunds on hostfault cancels; nonrefundable on buyerfault per
studio matrix.

Deposit holds: not GMV; no platform fee on captures; lifecycle events
logged.

Overtime/overages/change orders feeable at standard rates when upheld.

Linked Group receipts show two sections and two buyerfee lines; ledgers
remain separated; partial refunds handled per booking.

Analytics: revenue by type (talent vs studio), fee mix, ACH penetration,
discount impact, deposit claim rates, chargeback ratios by type.

K\) Why this works

Simple, predictable economics extend cleanly to studios; buyers see
clear line items, hosts see reliable takehome.

Margins protected: buyer fee offsets processing; deposits don't inflate
GMV or distort fee math.

Scalable ops: perbooking ledgers + group receipts make refunds,
disputes, and reporting straightforward.

Aligned incentives: IB discount encourages fast conversion; fee tiers
keep highvalue bookings onplatform.

SubSection 3.2 --- Pricing & Tiers (Launch: Start Free, Grow, Then
Monetize in Layers)

Goal: Maximize early adoption and bookings by removing monthly paywalls
and monetizing via takerate (see §3.1) and optional, usagebased addons
that never compromise fairness. Introduce an optional Pro tier only
after we reach liquidity and can prove it increases creator revenue.

A\) Principles (launch stage)

No subscriptions at launch --- free to join, free to list, free to
message within generous fairuse.

Value is earned, not paywalled --- verification, reliability, and
reputation unlock visibility and perks.

Payasyougo, not rent --- Boosts/RFPs are usagebased; no forced bundles.

Fairness & safety first --- paid visibility never outranks relevance or
safety gates.

Monetize later, when proven --- add an optional Pro tier only after
clear, databacked ROI for users.

B\) What everyone gets for free at launch (simple, generous)

Multirole profiles: up to 3 service profiles per account (Model /
Photographer / Videographer / Creator).

Portfolio & storage: up to 100 images + 20 videos; 15 GB total storage
(pooled across roles).

Messaging: 40 newconversation credits/month (unlimited replies & all
booking threads).

Booking stack: escrow, contracts/releases, licensing tiers; calendar &
ICS sync; travel calculator (see §1.3).

Social metrics: connect IG/YT/TT/X; verified chips on profile & cards
(see §1.2 addendum).

Fees: commission per §3.1 (12% provider; 5% buyer, \$3 min, 3% ACH when
enabled).

No listing fees. No paid storage. No paid DM packs at launch.

C\) Earned trust perks (free, but gated by safety/reliability)

1\) ID Verified

Unlock Instant Book eligibility.

+20 newconversation credits/month (total 60).

Search nudge (minor tiebreak when results are otherwise equal).

Eligible for "Verifiedonly" buyer filters.

2\) Trusted Pro (Background Check passed)

--0.5% providerfee discount (stacks with Instant Book --1%; floor 9%
from §3.1).

Priority in RFP request queues.

Onetime \$15 Boost coupon (funded from CAC budget).

3\) High Reputation (Rep ≥ 85; see §1.5)

Earned tiebreak in ranking after relevance/availability/distance/price.

Early Payout eligibility (peruse; see §E).

Invite priority in Smart Invites.

None of these can be bought. They must be earned via verification,
reliability, and great reviews.

D\) Usagebased monetization (optional; never paytowin)

1\) Search Boost (CPC with daily caps)

Promotes cards only in queries the provider already matches.

Labeled Promoted; strict density limits (≤2 in top 20; ≤1 above the
fold).

Eligibility: ID Verified, Rep ≥ 70, no recent strikes.

2\) Featured Carousels (fixedterm)

City/category home modules (e.g., "Featured in Houston").

Weekly flat price; slot caps; guaranteed rotation.

3\) RFP Broadcast Credits (for buyers/teams)

Post a brief (role, city, budget) → broadcast to matching verified
providers.

Sold in small packs (e.g., 5 for \$29). Replies remain free.

4\) Optional buyer ACH discount

Buyer fee 5% (min \$3) → 3% when paying via ACH once enabled (mirrors
norms, reduces costs; see §3.1).

E\) Early Payout (peruse, not a plan)

Eligibility: Rep ≥ 85 and ID Verified or Trusted Pro.

Pricing: 0.5% per accelerated payout (applied to the providerfee
component only), charged only when used.

Limit: Max once per booking; no stacking.

F\) Storage & deliverables (no paywall at launch)

Base 15 GB for all; 30 GB when ID Verified; 50 GB when Trusted Pro or
Rep ≥ 85.

Large sets can use external links (Drive/Dropbox); platform captures a
manifest (name/size/checksum) for disputes.

Revisit storage billing only if \>5% of active users routinely hit
ceilings and costs materially increase.

G\) Messaging health & antispam (no paytospam)

Monthly 40 newconversation credits; +20 for ID Verified; +20 for Trusted
Pro (max 80).

Credits autoreplenish monthly; extra credit purchases disabled at
launch.

"Nudge" limit: 1 priority nudge / thread / day; abuse throttled;
repeated violations reduce newconversation caps.

H\) Fairness & ranking guardrails (immutable)

Relevance first: query fit → availability → distance → price → Rep
tiebreak → Verified/Trusted nudges.

Paid visibility caps: strict density limits; clear Promoted labels;
never outrank better matches.

Safety gating: Boosts & RFP broadcasts require ID Verified, Rep ≥ 70, no
recent strikes.

I\) Launch promos (transactionfirst; timeboxed by city)

0% buyer fee on first booking in launch cities.

--2% provider fee for first 60 days postlaunch (stackaware; respects 9%
floor).

Verification subsidies: cover part of ID cost for the first 300
signups/city; \$15 coupon on passing Background.

City promos rendered as strikethrough on fee lines (e.g., "Buyer fee
\~5%\~ → 0%").

J\) When (and only when) to add an optional Pro plan later

Introduce a voluntary Pro tier only if all triggers are true in ≥ 2
launch cities:

Liquidity: Search→Inquiry ≥ 20%; Inquiry→Booking ≥ 35%; Repeat bookings
≥ 30%.

Willingness to pay: ≥ 20% of active providers repeatedly buy Boosts/RFP
credits.

Pro uplift proof: Piloted Pro features show ≥ 20% conversion/GMV lift
vs. control.

Community health: NPS ≥ 45 and Pro does not depress Free engagement.

If/when launched: keep Pro optional and valueadd (e.g., monthly Boost
stipend, advanced analytics, concierge), never required for
discoverability.

K\) Metrics to watch (prove we chose right)

Activation: % of new providers publishing ≥ 1 package within 7 days → \>
50%.

Messaging health: Median first response time ≤ 2 hours; abuse reports \<
0.3 / 100 conversations.

Verification adoption: ID ≥ 60%, Trusted Pro ≥ 15% by day 60 in a city.

Unit economics: Booking net (per §3.1) positive in ≥ 95% of
transactions; smallorder min protects margin.

Boost ROI: Median paid Boost yields ≥ 2.5× incremental GMV.

Repeat: 30%+ repeat bookings within 90 days in mature launch city.

L\) Acceptance criteria (to mark 3.2 FINAL)

No subscriptions at launch; no paid storage; no paid DM packs.

Feature gates/perks are driven by Verification, Trusted Pro, and
Reputation, not payment.

Search Boost, Featured, RFP credits implemented as usagebased with
eligibility gates, labels, and density caps.

Early Payout available peruse for qualified providers.

Storage tiers increase via verification/reputation; externallink
manifesting implemented.

Messaging credit system live; abuse throttles; "nudge" limits enforced.

Launch promos configurable per city/cohort (fee holidays, provider fee
reductions, verification subsidies).

Dashboards: activation, verification adoption, Boost ROI, unit
economics, response times, repeat bookings.

M\) Why this works (launch economics & growth)

Removes adoption friction that hurt legacy platforms (no "pay to
participate").

Aligns incentives --- we profit when users profit (commission), not
before.

Builds trust at scale --- earned perks (verification/reputation) boost
safety and conversion.

Keeps options open --- once liquidity and ROI are proven, we can add an
optional Pro that power users want to pay for.

Notes for §3.1 consistency (already reflected)

Keep 12% provider / 5% buyer (min \$3; 3% ACH); Instant Book --1%,
Trusted Pro --0.5%, highvalue tier 10% above \$1,000; floor 9%.

Early Payout is peruse (0.5%) and eligibilitybased --- not tied to any
subscription.

SubSection 3.3 --- Paid Boosting & Promotions (UsageBased Only)

Goal: Unlock incremental bookings and early revenue without harming
trust or liquidity. Paid visibility is optional, eligibilitygated,
clearly labeled, and strictly capped. Organic relevance remains the
primary ranking signal. We pilot quietly (Houston) and scale only if
metrics prove netpositive.

A\) Principles (grounded in research)

Fairfirst, never paytowin. Organic ranking = query match → availability
→ distance → price fit → Rep Score. Paid units never displace more
relevant organic matches.

Eligibility before dollars. Boosts only for proven, trusted providers
(ID Verified, Rep ≥ 75, ≥2 completed onplatform bookings or ≥1 verified
reference, no active safety flags).

Transparency & control. Every paid unit is labeled Promoted with a "Why
am I seeing this?" explainer; buyers can Hide a provider and Report.

Hard caps & guardrails. Strict density, frequency, and impressionshare
caps; qualityscore weighting; misrepresentation = autopause.

Pilot, measure, earn the right to scale. Quiet Houston beta → expand
only if we hit growthsafe KPIs (organic share, buyer CTR/conv, provider
ROAS) and no trust regressions.

B\) Inventory & Placements (v1, minimal & conservative)

Search Results Boost (primary)

Placement: results list.

Format: standard profile card + Promoted chip + dynamic ribbon (e.g.,
"Instant Book", "Trusted Pro", "Available this week").

Density caps: ≤1 Promoted abovethefold, ≤2 Promoted in top 20 results.

Category / City Featured Carousels (home & landing)

Modules: "Featured in Houston", "Featured Photographers".

Slots: 10--12 cards, rotating evenly; visible only in the pilot city.

Not in v1: inbox/proposal boosting, email ads, push highlights. We do
not boost RFP proposal order or message thread ranking (avoids
"paytowin" backlash).

C\) Products & Pricing (usagebased, no bundles)

Search Boost (CPC)

Pilot floors (illustrative): TierA city (Houston) --- Models \$0.90,
Photographers \$0.70, Videographers \$0.80, Creators \$0.85.

Budgeting: daily budget + max CPC; even pacing; prepaid wallet; charge
on valid clicks only.

Ordering (within paid caps only): Score = 0.5×log(bid) +
0.5×QualityScore.

Featured Carousel (flat weekly)

Pricing: \$49--\$89 / week (Houston, by role).

Delivery: impression guarantees; rotation fairness; makegood credits if
short.

No subscriptions, no longterm commitments, no forced packs.

D\) Eligibility, Targeting & Relevance (what keeps it fair)

Eligibility: ID Verified, Rep ≥ 75, ≥2 completed bookings (or ≥1
verified reference), no active safety flags, policycompliant content.

Query matching (hard filter): role, location radius, availability
window, price range, NSFW toggle must all match; otherwise no delivery.

Audience targeting: provider may narrow by city/radius/price band;
negative keywords/genres allowed.

QualityScore (0--1): exact filter match, recent response rate/time, Rep,
Instant Book, price fit to query median, historical CTR/conv. New
boosters start at 0.5.

E\) Rotation, Frequency & ShareofShelf Caps

Frequency caps (per buyer): max 2 paid impressions/session, 5/day, 4h
cooldown per provider/buyer pair.

Provider impressionshare cap: paid impressions per provider ≤8% of all
eligible paid impressions/day (prevents domination).

Organic share guardrail (platformwide): at least 85--90% of buyer result
clicks must land on organic cards in the pilot (monitored KPI).

Roundrobin within caps: if eligible \> slots, rotate weighted by
(remaining budget × QualityScore).

F\) Provider Experience (setup → proof of value)

Setup flow: pick service profile → choose Search Boost or Featured → set
budget & bid → (optional) narrow targeting → confirm.

Creative policy: no custom ads; we use the profile card + system ribbon
(prevents deceptive creative).

Guidance: "Suggested bid" and "expected clicks/bookings" estimates;
"Improve QualityScore" checklist (ID verify, reduce response time,
enable Instant Book, adjust price fit).

Reporting (realtime): impressions, clicks, CTR, avg CPC, inquiries,
bookings, GMV attributed, ROAS, and incremental lift via a 10% holdout
(eligible but not shown).

Autocoaching: if 7day ROAS \< 1.5×, show "Consider pausing or improving
QS" prompt; if \<1.0× after 14 days, recommend pause.

G\) Buyer Experience (clarity & control)

Labeling: Promoted chip + info tooltip ("Matches your filters; purchased
limited promotion. Promoted never outranks more relevant results.")

Controls: Hide this provider (suppresses organic & paid for 30 days),
Report (routes to Safety).

Consistency: paid units respect NSFW settings and all filters; density
caps enforced above.

H\) Fraud, Safety & Abuse Controls

Invalid click detection: rapid repeats, zerodwell bounces, bot/device
anomalies, selfclicking, rings → automark invalid & credit back CPC;
repeated anomalies throttle delivery & flag for review.

Misrepresentation: price/availability mismatches or baitandswitch →
autopause campaign + warning; repeat → suspension.

Safety linkage: any active safety investigation → suppress all paid
delivery until cleared.

Budget protection: daily overspend guard (≤5% variance) + autocredit on
pacing errors. Chargeback shield: new campaigns disabled if unresolved
chargebacks.

I\) Launch Posture & Comms (Houston pilot)

Access: inviteonly cohort of 100--200 eligible providers per role in
Houston for first 6--8 weeks.

Messaging to community: publish an Integrity Pledge (fairfirst, clear
labels, hard caps, eligibility gates).

Feedback loop: inproduct survey after 2 weeks of spend; provider & buyer
focus groups at week 4; adjust caps/floors accordingly.

Reinvestment: earmark 20--30% of pilot Boost revenue to buyer
acquisition in Houston (drives net liquidity).

J\) KPIs & "Kill Switch" Thresholds (first 60--90 days)

Adoption & performance

≥ 12--18% of eligible providers try Boost; Featured weekly slot fill
≥60%.

Median ROAS ≥ 2.5×; median costperbooking ≤ \$18 (TierA).

Buyer experience & trust

Organic click share ≥ 85--90% (guardrail).

Buyer Hide rate ≤ 3% of paid impressions; Safety reports ≤ 0.2 / 1,000
paid impressions.

No significant drop in search→inquiry or inquiry→booking vs. prepilot
baselines.

Fairness & ecosystem health

Gini index of paid impression distribution stays below threshold (no
provider monopolies).

Nonboosted, highRep providers maintain stable inquiry rates (±10%).

Kill switch (autopause) if any occur:

Organic click share \< 80% for 7 rolling days; or

Buyer Hide rate \> 5% for 7 days; or

Incremental bookings (holdout) ≤ 0 for 2 consecutive weeks; or

Spike in safety reports tied to promoted cards.

K\) Pricing Governance & City Tiers

City tiers: TierA (Houston, Dallas, LA, NYC, ATL) → TierB (growing
metros) → TierC (smaller metros).

CPC floors review: monthly; adjust ±\$0.10--\$0.20 based on fill,
provider ROAS, and buyer CTR/conv.

Featured pricing review: quarterly by impressions delivered, CTR,
bookings/slot.

L\) What we won't do (explicit guardrails)

No boosting of proposals/RFP response order or message thread
prominence.

No "unverified" or lowRep accounts in paid slots.

No unlabeled or disguised ads.

No auction in v1 (simplicity first); we may test a hybrid bid × QS
auction later if/when liquidity warrants.

M\) Acceptance Criteria (mark 3.3 FINAL)

Search Boost (CPC) live with city+role floors, daily budgets, validclick
billing, even pacing.

Featured Carousel live with weekly flat pricing, rotation, impression
guarantees & makegoods.

Eligibility gates enforced (ID, Rep ≥ 75, booking/reference minimums, no
safety flags); query match hard filter; NSFW compliance.

Caps: density (≤1 above fold; ≤2 in top 20), frequency (2/session,
5/day, 4h cooldown), provider impression share ≤ 8%/day.

QualityScore & ordering implemented; fair roundrobin pacing; organic
share guardrail tracked.

Fraud & safety: invalidclick credits, overspend guard, autopause on
misrep/safety.

Reporting: realtime KPIs + holdoutbased incrementality; autocoaching on
low ROAS.

Admin tools: floors, slot caps, guardrails/kill switch, makegood
credits, cohort gating.

Comms: Integrity Pledge published; buyer labeling & controls shipped;
feedback loop live.

N\) Why this works (for launch)

Protects growth: Paid units are sparse, vetted, and relevancebound;
early users see that quality wins without paying.

Aligns incentives: Providers can optin to spend when it pays; we prove
incremental bookings via holdouts, not just clicks.

Avoids known pitfalls: No inbox/proposal boosting (sidesteps "paytowin"
backlash); strict caps prevent ad overload.

Scales responsibly: Pilot → prove → expand. If metrics or sentiment sag,
kill switch lets us pull back instantly.

SubSection 3.4 --- Verification & Compliance Monetization

Goal: Maximize early adoption and bookings while raising trust. Use
automationfirst verification with manualexception only, verify at
milestones (not at signup), and absorb essential costs during launch.
Store attestations (Pass/Fail) rather than raw PII.

A\) Principles (launch posture)

Frictionlight, milestonegated. No heavy checks at signup. We trigger
verification only when it unlocks value or reduces risk (e.g., Instant
Book, first payout, privateaddress shoots).

Automation first, humans last. Use vendor SDKs (doc scan, liveness,
geocode) and OCR to autoapprove the vast majority; route only fails/edge
cases to a small ops queue.

Platform absorbs essential costs (launch). Treat ID checks as customer
acquisition and trust investment; revisit after liquidity.

Privacy by design. We keep outcome + timestamp + vendor; vendors hold
sensitive artifacts.

Explainable & fair. Clear consent, reasons, appeals. No protectedclass
logic.

Citylevel dials. Subsidy, triggers, and badge rules configurable per
launch city.

B\) The Verification Ladder (what, when, why)

Tier 0 --- Account Basics (always free)

Email + phone (SMS) verify, device fingerprint, IP risk screen.

Badge: New --- building trust. Limited DM credits (see §3.2).

Tier 1 --- ID Verification (unlocks value; platformpaid at launch)

Triggers (any of): enable Instant Book; accept first paid booking;
release first payout; host at a private address (nonstudio); exceed
monthly newconversation cap.

Method: gov ID scan + selfie liveness + fraud checks (SDK).

Unlocks: ID Verified badge, Instant Book, +20 DM credits, minor search
tiebreak (equal matches).

Refresh: every 24 months or on risk events.

Tier 2 --- Background Check ("Trusted Pro", optional; passthrough
priced)

Triggers: optin for Trusted Pro badge; required for certain sensitive
categories if ever added.

Method: SSN trace, national criminal/sexoffender, sanctions; countylevel
where indicated by vendor logic.

Unlocks: Trusted Pro badge, provider fee --0.5% (see §3.1), RFP
priority, onetime \$15 Boost coupon.

Refresh: 12 months or on risk events; FCRAstyle adverse action + appeal
flow.

Tier 3 --- Studio Verification (optional; "Lite" first)

When: user wants a Studio Verified badge or frequently sets their own
space as the shoot location.

Lite (MVP, automationheavy): address claim + one supporting doc
(lease/utility/biz registration) → OCR + name/address match +
geocode/Place lookup → autoapprove if match confidence high; manual
review only on fails.

Full (defer to Phase 2): optional remote video walkthrough or thirdparty
inspection for highvolume venues.

Unlocks: Studio Verified badge; search filter "Studio access: verified";
fastpath location selection at checkout.

Social Verification (optional, free)

OAuth to IG/YT/TT/X; nightly sync metrics → verified chips and
perplatform search filters (see §1.2 addendum).

Age/NSFW Eligibility (derived)

Age derived from Tier 1; enables artisticnudity portfolios per policy
(mainstreamfirst stance).

C\) Flows & UX (keep it fast, clear, recoverable)

2minute ID flow target; progress meter; "Why you're seeing this"
explainer tied to the trigger (e.g., "Needed to release payouts").

Grace periods: If a trigger occurs midconversation, allow user to finish
current action and prompt verification before the next gated action.

Failure recovery: clear reason category + retake guidance; escalate to
manual only after 2 failed attempts.

No hard walls at signup: users can browse, build profile/portfolio, and
message within free limits before any KYC.

D\) Cost & Monetization Posture (launch → scale)

Who pays (launch):

ID (Tier 1): Platformpaid (subsidized) in founding cities.

Background (Tier 2): Passthrough pricing; we may add a small coupon to
encourage early adoption.

Studio Lite (Tier 3): Platformpaid doc review for first 200
studios/city; then \$19 docreview fee (waived by promo when needed).

Social OAuth: free.

Budget guardrails (Ops/Finance):

Set a monthly KYC budget cap per city (e.g., \$750--\$1,500),
autothrottle subsidies if exceeded (e.g., defer nonurgent Tier 1 until
payout trigger).

Track cost per verified and cost per incremental booking uplift; keep
CAC efficient.

Future levers (only postliquidity):

Optional expedited verification (24h fast lane) for a small fee.

Bundles (ID + BG) with modest margin only if conversion lift is proven
and churn impact is nil.

E\) Automation & Ops Model (devlight, scalable)

Vendors: one KYC SDK (ID + liveness), one BG vendor, geocode/Place API
for Studio Lite.

Manualexception queue: target \<10% of ID attempts; SLAs: ID \< 24h
(exceptions), BG ≤ 48h (county delays may vary), Studio Lite \< 24h for
failed automatches.

Staffing (pilot): 1 parttime reviewer per \~500--700 monthly
verifications (exceptions only).

Dashboards: pass/fail rates, exception volume, completion time, dropoff
at each step, cost per check, conversion lift vs. unverified.

F\) Data Handling & Compliance

We store: status (Pass/Fail/Needs info), reason codes, timestamp, vendor
ID; no raw ID images/biometrics.

Retention: verification attestations 24 months or until account
deletion; honor legal holds.

Consent: explicit consent screens; link to privacy, biometric notices
where applicable.

FCRA/EEOC: preadverse + adverse action for BG denials; individualized
assessment; appeal path.

Nondiscrimination: no targeting by protected class; policy + audits.

Marketplace role: verification conveys eligibility, not employment or
moral certification.

G\) Studio Verification --- MVP (what we do now vs later)

Do now (Lite): doc OCR + name/address match + geocode/Place check;
autoapprove if high confidence; manual on fails.

Don't do now: inperson inspections, insurance validation, complex
KYB---defer to Phase 2 for highvolume venues.

Booking UX: buyers can select a Verified Studio from a list; private
addresses masked until confirm; location verification optional at
checkout for private addresses ("Verify general area").

H\) Incentives (make trust feel rewarding)

ID Verified: Instant Book + +20 DM credits; minor search tiebreak on
equal matches.

Trusted Pro: fee --0.5%, RFP priority, \$15 Boost coupon (see §3.3),
badge on cards.

Studio Verified: filterable badge; "Studio" ribbon on cards; inclusion
in "Studios in \[City\]" carousel.

SocialVerified: perplatform chips and search filters; nightly trends on
profile.

I\) KPIs & Guardrails (first 90 days per city)

Adoption: ID ≥ 60% of active users; Trusted Pro ≥ 15% of active
providers; Studio Lite ≥ 10% of active studios.

Speed: median ID completion \< 2 min (selfserve); BG ≤ 48h (85%); Studio
Lite ≤ 24h (exceptions).

Conversion lift (vs. unverified): ID → +12--20% search→inquiry; Trusted
Pro → +10--15% inquiry→booking.

Dropoff: verificationstep abandonment \< 20%; if higher, simplify flow
or move trigger later.

Cost: monthly KYC spend within ±10% of budget cap; cost/verified flat to
down.

Kill switches: if search→inquiry or inquiry→booking drops \>10%
postgating in a cohort, relax triggers (e.g., gate at payout only) until
metrics recover.

J\) Pricing (simple & growthfriendly at launch)

ID Verification: \$0 to user (platformpaid) in founding cities.

Background Check (Trusted Pro): passthrough (e.g., \~\$25--\$35 avg),
with promo coupon in first 60 days.

Studio Lite: \$0 for first 200 per city; then \$19 (doc review).

Social OAuth: \$0.

Expedite (later): optional \$9 fast lane if demanded (postliquidity).

K\) Acceptance Criteria (mark 3.4 FINAL)

Milestonegated triggers wired (Instant Book, first payout, private
address, message caps).

Vendor integrations live (ID/liveness, BG, geocode), with
manualexception queue + SLAs.

Subsidy controls: percity KYC budget caps; throttle rules; ops
dashboards.

Attestationonly storage; consent & privacy notices; FCRA/appeals for BG.

Studio Lite OCR+geocode flow live; manual fallback; badge + search
filter.

Incentives: badges, fee nudge (Trusted Pro), DM boost, search tiebreaks
wired.

Metrics & kill switches: adoption, speed, dropoff, conversion lift, cost
per verified; autorelax triggers if growth impact detected.

L\) Why this works

Protects growth: No heavy checks at signup; verification happens when
users see the value (payouts, Instant Book).

Controls cost & ops load: Automation handles most verifications;
platform pays for the musthave checks only; tight budget caps.

Builds trust fast: Visible badges and small ranking nudges reward safe,
reliable behavior and raise booking confidence.

Scales cleanly: Studio Lite now; deeper inspections only when warranted.
Citylevel dials let us tune friction and spend.

Notes for PM/Eng handoff: keep triggers and budgets configurable per
city; log all verification events for audit; run monthly reviews on
pass/fail rates, exception causes, and dropoff to continuously trim
friction without compromising safety.

§3.5 --- Brand/Buyer Products (Briefs/RFPs, Shortlists, Concierge,
Delivery)

Goal: Buyers (brands, agencies, studios, solo creators) go from idea →
shortlist → booked → delivered fast, with clear scope, documents,
storagesane delivery, and verifiable outcomes---without subscriptions.
Everything stays fair (relevancefirst), safe (escrow + esign), and
growthfriendly (usagebased RFP credits only).

A\) Principles

Speed with clarity: Briefs produce applestoapples quotes; awarding
triggers escrow, documents, and a Delivery Room automatically.

Relevance over volume: Invite the right providers; broadcast only to
eligible, verified cohorts.

Trustfirst: IDVerified/Trusted Pro gating, esign before checkin,
onplatform escrow & dispute flows.

Storagesane delivery: Originals remain in buyer/provider cloud
(Drive/Dropbox/etc.); platform stores previews + manifests only.

Usagebased monetization: Smart Invite is free; RFP is creditsbased (no
monthly plans, no paywalls).

B\) Buyer Personas & JobstobeDone

Solo/SMB buyer: Needs a model/photographer for a simple shoot; wants
fast quotes and clear outcomes.

Marketing team/agency: Multiseat, needs shortlists, approvals, brand
docs, reporting.

Studio ops: Frequent, repeat bookings; prefers Verified Studios; cares
about schedule reliability.

Creator collab buyer: Seeks socialreach deliverables (IG/TT/YT posts)
with verification and postingwindow guarantees.

C\) Brief Composer (Quick & Full)

Required first step (Quick Brief = \~60s; Full Brief for complex jobs):

Project basics: Role(s), city/radius, date(s)/time(s), duration.

Goal & deliverables: Presets (e.g., "10 edited photos (3kpx), 2 vertical
videos (1080×1920, ≤60s)") + Influence presets (IG Collab, Story
Mentions, TT Post, YT Short) with posting window & min live.

Style refs: Moodboard upload/links; keywords.

Budget: Range or fixed; Budget sanity meter (compares to city/role
median).

Location: Pick Verified Studio or "Buyer provides address" (masked until
award); travel radius/fee toggle.

Eligibility & safety: IDVerified/Trustedonly toggles, NDA toggle, Nudity
& Boundaries (if models involved; artisticnudity only).

Model specifics (if applicable): Look filters + nudity tier + chaperone
policy + social metrics filters.

Timeline: response deadline, delivery date.

Docs preview: Shows the Smart Docs pack (SOW, License, Release, NDA if
toggled) that will autoattach on award.

Privacy: Hide brand name until award (toggle).

D\) Smart Invite & RFP Broadcast

Smart Invite (free):

System suggests 8--15 bestfit providers (role, availability, distance,
price fit, Rep Score, social metrics).

Buyer can edit and send invites (free). Providers get a consolidated
request thread with Quick Quote.

RFP Broadcast (creditsbased):

Sends the brief to a wider pool of eligible providers (IDVerified, Rep ≥
70, no safety flags).

Pricing: credit packs (e.g., 5 for \$29).

Guardrails: min budget floors by city/role/duration; 1 live
broadcast/role per buyer; template checks to reduce spam/underpay.

E\) Proposal & Pricing UX (Provider)

Quick Quote (≈60s): select package, price, availability, short note;
optional addons (travel, extra edits, overtime).

Full Proposal: itemized deliverables (incl. social deliverables),
schedule/milestones, licensing line items, portfolio links.

No proposal peeking: providers don't see others' bids.

F\) Compare & Award (applestoapples + escrow)

Compare view: normalized grid: Price, What's included, Rep Score, Badges
(ID/Trusted/Studio), Travel, Change/Overtime, Social posting window,
Notes.

Fit Score (0--100): assistive signal explaining match to brief (style,
budget, distance, availability).

Award flow: select winner → escrow deposit (default 50%, configurable) →
Smart Docs esign session opens → booking created.

G\) Documents & ESign (Smart Docs)

Autoattach pack on award: Service Agreement/SOW, License/Usage Addendum,
Model Release, Property/Studio Release (if needed), NDA (if toggled),
Safety Addendum (if Nudity Tier \> Lingerie).

Esign: draw/type with audit trail (IP, timestamp, device).

Gate: Checkin blocked until required docs are signed. Escrow won't
release without docs + acceptance.

H\) Delivery Room (storagesane delivery with verification)

Manifest = source of truth: Autogenerated from accepted quote
(counts/specs).

Storage model:

Previews on platform: webres photos & 720p video proxies; watermarks
allowed for previews.

Originals external: Google Drive / Dropbox / OneDrive / Box / S3
presigned owned by provider.

Ingestion:

OAuth mode (preferred): pull file list/metadata → pin manifest
(names/sizes/MIME/URLs).

Linkonly mode: paste share URLs; we crawl to create a readonly manifest.

Checksums: compute hashes for onplatform files; store length/etag for
externals; providers may paste SHA256 for finals.

Autochecks on upload: count, type/codec, pixel dimensions,
bitrate/duration, color profile, no watermarks on finals.

"All finals delivered" provider toggle validates against manifest.

I\) Acceptance, Revisions & AutoAccept

Technical acceptance: once autochecks pass, Buyer Review window opens.

Buyer Review: default 3 days (packageconfigurable) to accept, partial
accept (per milestone/group), or request inscope revisions (1 round
included).

Autoaccept: if buyer inactive after 3 days and autochecks passed, system
autoaccepts remaining deliverables; escrow releases per §1.3.

Change orders: outofscope requests routed to paid Change Order.

J\) Influence/Promo Deliverables (verification & enforcement)

Presets: IG Collab Post + Story Mentions; TikTok Post (+Duet/Stitch
optional); YouTube Short + Community Post.

Posting window & minimum live: buyer sets (e.g., post within 72h, remain
live ≥7 days).

Verification:

If accounts linked via OAuth, system autoverifies URL and monitors live
status.

If not linked, provider submits the public URL; system captures a
snapshot & status; buyer confirms.

Noncompliance: autoopens a deliverable dispute → 24h cure window →
partial refund equal to the allocated value if missed/removed.

K\) Attendance, NoShows, Disputes (fast, evidencebased)

Checkin/out: both parties tap Start/End (geofenced, ±60 min).

Evidence log: timestamps, geotags, chat/call logs (durations),
manifests, behindthescenes snaps.

Buyer noshow / late cancel: refunds per policy (e.g., 72--24h = 50%
payout; \<24h = 100% payout).

Provider noshow: buyer 100% refund + goodwill credit; provider
reliability strike & Instant Book pause.

Deliverables shortfall: 48h cure window; else partial refund
proportional to undelivered items.

Subjective disputes: one revision → Neutral Review (scopebased outcome:
reedit or partial refund).

Safety exception: fee waivers/credits as needed; safety review
autoopens.

L\) Boards & Collaboration

Boards: named shortlists with status tags ("New, Invited, Proposed,
Awarded").

Teamwork: \@mentions, comments, polls; readonly share link; optional NDA
gate for external reviewers.

Live freshness: cards show availability chips and price updates; stale
badge after 14 days.

M\) Concierge

Concierge Light (free, automated): AI refines brief, suggests
scope/budget, drafts invites, schedules top 3 for 15min slots; nudges
for NDA and verifiedonly toggles.

Human Concierge (pilot; budgets ≥ \$3k): coordinator curates talent,
wrangles schedules/deliverables; free at launch in founding cities;
later optional 2% success fee (postliquidity).

N\) Permissions, Buyer Trust & Privacy

Roles: Owner (billing/contracts), Editor (briefs/awards), Commenter
(notes/votes).

Payment Verified badge: once funding source on file.

Privacy: brand name masking until award; private addresses masked until
confirm; generalarea safety share during active booking only.

O\) Safety & Quality Controls

Eligibility gates: RFP to IDVerified (Trustedonly optional).

Budget floors: prevent unrealistic budgets; assist with suggested
ranges.

Offplatform detection: warnings & throttles in chat.

NSFW guardrails: artisticnudity only; explicit content blocked; nudity
tiers & safety addendum enforced.

Buyer reputation: Providers see Buyer Rep (ontime payment, dispute rate,
repeat bookings).

P\) Pricing & Credits (Launch)

PDFs/versioning in thread.

Calendar: ICS export; conflict checks vs provider availability.

Storage: external delivery required for large assets; platform stores
previews + manifests only (see §1.4).

Social OAuth: for autoverification of influence deliverables.

R\) Analytics

Buyer dashboard: outreach→response, timetoaward, spend by project, cost
per deliverable, provider performance.

Platform: RFP adoption, response quality, award rate, GMV per brief,
credit refund rate, Instant Book vs RFP split, deliverable dispute
rates, autoaccept rate.

S\) KPIs & Targets (first 90 days/city)

Adoption: ≥ 35% of bookings originate via Smart Invite/RFP flows.

Speed: median brief → first qualified response ≤ 2 hours (business
hours); brief → award ≤ 48 hours for Quick Briefs.

Quality: ≥ 60% of broadcasts yield ≥3 qualified responses; provider
response rate ≥ 45%; buyer CSAT ≥ 4.5/5.

Trust: disputes/noshows at or below Instant Book baseline; offplatform
attempts in RFP threads \< 1%.

Economics: RFPsourced GMV ≥ 30% by month 6; credit refund rate \< 12%.

Delivery health: autoaccept ≥ 50% of jobs; deliverable disputes \< 5%;
influence noncompliance \< 6%.

T\) Acceptance Criteria (mark §3.5 FINAL)

Drive/Dropbox/etc. with verifiable manifests.

Faster to "yes": Smart Invite + Quick Quotes + Fit Score reduce time to
award.

Verifiable outcomes: Autochecks, posting verification, and autoaccept
keep projects moving and payouts timely.

SubSection 3.6 --- Seller Tools & Workflows (Models • Photographers •
Videographers • Creators)

Goal: Give sellers a fast, repeatable workflow that turns profile views
into booked, wellscoped jobs---and makes delivery, disputes, and payouts
painless. Tools are roleaware, storagesane, and trustfirst. Monetization
remains usagebased (no subscriptions at launch).

A\) Principles

Publish in minutes, improve forever: ship an MVP service profile
quickly; refine with datadriven suggestions.

Roleaware, single account: one login, multiple service profiles (Model /
Photographer / Videographer / Creator) with clean separation in search
and reviews.

Clarity prevents disputes: packages, Smart Docs, Delivery Room
manifests, and timeboxed review windows make outcomes objective.

Storagesane by default: previews on platform; originals remain in
seller's cloud (Drive/Dropbox/OneDrive/Box/S3 links).

Trust earns advantages: verification & reputation unlock Instant Book,
tiebreaks, Early Payout, RFP priority---never paytowin.

B\) Seller Onboarding Wizard (10--12 minutes, roleaware)

Step 1 --- Choose roles: Model / Photographer / Videographer / Creator
(can add more later).\
Step 2 --- Portfolio basics: upload perrole cover image(s), 12--24
highlights; set Nudity Tier & Comfort (Models/Creators).\
Step 3 --- Packages (per role): pick package templates (below), add
price/duration/what's included, turnaround time, revision policy,
overtime & change rates.\
Step 4 --- Addons: travel (matrix), extra looks/edits, rush delivery,
social posts, studio rental addon, hair/makeup partner, etc.\
Step 5 --- Availability: weekly schedule blocks, Instant Book windows,
buffers, travel time logic; connect calendar (ICS).\
Step 6 --- Location: base city, service radius, touring dates (for
traveling models/creators).\
Step 7 --- Safety & preferences: chaperone welcomed/required, genderpref
team (optional), boundaries.\
Step 8 --- Pricing strategy: enable intro discount (first 3 bookings),
lastminute fill (autodiscount empty slots), minimum price guardrail.\
Step 9 --- Connect social: IG/YT/TT/X for verified chips & search
filters (per §1.2 addendum).\
Step 10 --- Verification prompts: ID (to unlock Instant Book),
optionally Background (Trusted Pro), Studio Lite (if applicable).\
Publish → profile QA checklist + "What improves ranking" tips (response
time, verified docs, price fit).

Mobile essentials: checkin/out, messaging, Quick Quote, scantosign,
preview upload, push nudges.

P\) Why this works

Less friction, more bookings: sellers launch fast, quote faster, and
close with clarity.

Fewer disputes: standardized packages + Smart Docs + Delivery Room
manifests turn "hesaid/shesaid" into objective checks.

Costs under control: originals stay in sellers' cloud; we store only
previews + manifests; no surprise infra bills.

Trust compounds: verification and high Rep Score unlock advantages that
improve conversion and marketplace quality---without paywalls.

§3.7 --- Reviews, Reputation & Incentives

Goal: Capture highsignal, lowfriction feedback after every booking; turn
reliability and respect into visible trust; reward great behavior with
small but meaningful advantages---without creating paytowin or review
gaming.

A\) Principles

Only from verified interactions. Reviews and references originate only
from completed onplatform bookings (or marked "Completed --
TFP/Collab").

Doubleblind & timeboxed. Both sides review; neither sees the other's
until both submit or the window closes.

Roleaware & fair. Reviews are per role
(Model/Photographer/Videographer/Creator/FanSubscription Creator);
search/rank use rolespecific scores.

Evidence over rhetoric. Objective signals (attendance, deliverable
manifests, timing) carry more weight than freetext opinions.

Positive incentives, not paywalls. Rewards for reliability and
verification; never for positive sentiment specifically.

B\) When & how reviews happen (flow)

Trigger: When a booking moves to Completed (acceptance or autoaccept),
both parties receive review prompts.

Window: 7 days to submit; if one party submits, the other has 7 days
from that moment; then publish simultaneously.

Noshow / cancelled: If a side is deemed NoShow or Provider/Buyer Cancel
-- Late, the counterpart may leave a review; flagged with an Event label
(e.g., "Noshow").

TFP/Collab: Reviews allowed; labeled "Collab (no cash)".

Dispute coordination: If a dispute is open, the system delays
publication until resolution; reviews then publish with a Resolved
badge.

C\) Review structure (roleaware rubric)

Star rating (overall): 1--5 stars (halfstars allowed).\
Subratings (1--5, shown on profiles; weight into Reputation Score):

For Providers (e.g., Photographers/Videographers/Creators/Models as
hired talent)

Professionalism & Respect (onset conduct; comfort boundaries honored).

Communication (pre/during/post).

Reliability (ontime, prepared; aligns with checkin/checkout).

Quality vs Scope (deliverables matched the agreed brief/manifest).

Safety & Comfort (Models/Creators) (for bookings with talent; chaperone,
privacy).

For Buyers/Brands (visible to providers)

Clarity of Brief (scope, references, decisions).

Communication.

Reliability & Timeliness (arrived, stayed on schedule).

Respect & Safety (professional set, boundaries honored).

Payments & Approvals (escrow, acceptance, change orders handled
promptly).

Attachments (optional, storagesane):

Up to 3 preview images or short proxy clips (for context), or link to
public proof URL (e.g., verified promo post).

All attachments follow the artisticonly policy; no explicit content.

Private feedback to platform (not public): single freetext box for
safety/moderation signals.

D\) What displays on profiles & search cards

Overall role rating (e.g., 4.8) + rating histogram + \# of verified
reviews.

Recent highlights (last three reviews, 2line excerpts).

Badges & signals: ID Verified, Trusted Pro, Studio Verified,
SocialVerified, FanSubscription Creator (18+ gated).

Operational stats (last 90 days):

Ontime rate (arrived/start on time), Completion rate (jobs finished),
Dispute rate, Response time (median).

Verified references counter: number of completed onplatform
collaborations.

For buyers: a Buyer Rep panel is shown to providers (see §H).

Search cards include: Rep Score ring, average rating, count, last90day
ontime %, and badges.

E\) Reputation Score (0--100) --- computation & decay (refined)

Purpose: A quick, explainable trust signal; used in ranking as a
tiebreak (never overrides relevance/filters) and to gate certain
privileges (e.g., Boost eligibility, Instant Book).

Inputs & weights (roleaware; timeweighted):

Reviews & volume --- 40%

Bayesianadjusted average of overall star ratings (per role) using a
Wilson score prior, with recency weighting (last 90 days ×1.5).

Reliability & policy --- 25%

Ontime start %, completion rate, noshow/cancel strikes (negative weights
with decay), doc compliance before checkin.

Responsiveness --- 10%

Median first response time; reply rate to invites/RFP.

Verifications --- 15%

ID (base), Trusted Pro (+), Studio Verified (+), SocialVerified (+
small).

Recent performance --- 10%

Last 90day job NPS ("Would you book again?" Yes/No), dispute outcomes.

Decay & floors:

Strikes and poor events decay 25% per 90 days of clean activity.

New accounts show "New --- building reputation" until ≥3 verified
reviews (prevents low initial scores).

Gaming protection:

Volume weighting cap: one job cannot change score by \>3 pts.

Reciprocal review detection: correlated 5star exchanges get
downweighted.

Anomaly flags: suspicious IP/device overlaps; cluster analysis for ring
behavior; autoaudit queue.

F\) Incentives & achievements (behavior shaping)

Universal (roleagnostic):

Complete your first 3 jobs on time → "OnTime Streak" badge + +10 DM
credits.

\<1hour median response for 30 days → "Fast Responder" badge + search
tiebreak +1 (only in equal matches).

Complete ID → Instant Book + +20 DM credits.

Trusted Pro → Provider fee --0.5%, RFP priority, \$15 Boost coupon (per
§3.3).

Studio Verified → appears in studio filter; prioritized in "Studios in
\[City\]" carousels.

Rolespecific bonus nudges (examples):

Models/Creators: "Boundary Pro" (5 bookings with 'Safety & Comfort'
≥4.8) → profile highlight chip.

Photographers/Videographers: "Spec Perfect" (10 jobs with 100% manifest
pass, ≤1 revision) → small search nudge in equal ties.

FanSubscription Creators: "Promo Deliveries 10/10" (all posts verified
within window) → featured eligibility in "Reliable Promo" carousel.

Review completion incentives (neutral):

Completing any review within window → +5 DM credits (regardless of
rating).

No incentives for positive ratings (to avoid bias).

G\) Antigaming, moderation & appeals

Content policy filters: NLP and rulebased filters for
hate/harassment/doxxing/explicit content; block or route to moderation.

Defamation & proof: Fact claims (e.g., "stole equipment") must include
evidence (moderator can request); otherwise convert to opinion phrasing
or remove.

Extortion policy: Prohibit "change deliverables or I'll leave 1★";
report → fast moderation; outcomes: warning → strike → suspension.

Right of reply: Public owner reply allowed once per review; edit window
for typos 30 minutes postpublish.

Appeals: If review violates policy or is demonstrably false, removal or
redaction; SLA ≤5 business days.

Shadowweighting: Reviews from accounts with anomaly flags contribute
reduced weight without visible deletion (preserves transparency while
limiting harm).

Killswitch: If toxicity rate \> 0.8% of reviews in a 7day window,
tighten filters and increase human sampling.

H\) Buyer/Brand Reputation (visible to providers)

Buyer Rep (0--100) components:

Payments & approvals: escrow timely, acceptance within window.

Reliability: ontime arrival/start, cancellation/noshow rate.

Respect & Safety: subrating from providers; safety flags (sealed).

Dispute rate & outcomes.

Display to providers: Buyer Rep ring, recent labels ("Pays on time",
"Clear briefs"), and counts (repeat rate).

Gates: RFP Broadcast requires IDVerified; poor Buyer Rep can trigger
manual review on broadcasts.

I\) How Reviews & Rep affect ranking & access (guardrails)

Search ranking order: relevance → availability → distance → price fit →
Rep tiebreak → minor nudges (Verified/Trusted/Studio).

Boost eligibility (per §3.3): Rep ≥75 and IDVerified; safety flags
disable paid delivery.

Instant Book gating: Rep \<70 or recent strike → IB disabled until 30
clean days or after remediation.

Visibility throttles: Repeated disputes/late cancels lower impression
share temporarily (gradual recovery with clean activity).

J\) Notifications & UX copy (snippets)

"Review ready": "Your project with {Name} is complete---share how it
went (2 minutes). Your feedback publishes after both sides submit or in
7 days."

"Keep it respectful": "Reviews should be factual and professional. We
remove harassment, doxxing, or explicit content."

"Appeal received": "Thanks. Our team will review and respond within 5
business days. We may request evidence."

"Streak earned": "OnTime Streak unlocked: +10 DM credits and a profile
badge visible in search."

K\) KPIs & targets (first 90 days / city)

Review completion rate: ≥70% (bothsided) within 7 days.

Median time to first review: ≤24h postcompletion.

Toxicity rate: ≤0.5% of reviews flagged; confirmed violations ≤0.2%.

Disputeadjusted bias: rating drift after disputes ≤0.3★ (fairness).

Correlation to outcomes: Rep Score topquartile → ≥20% higher
inquiry→booking vs baseline.

Appeals SLA: ≤5 business days average resolution.

Noshow reduction: repeat noshows drop ≥30% after streak/strike logic.

L\) Acceptance criteria (mark 3.7 FINAL)

Doubleblind reviews with 7day window, simultaneous publish, and
disputeaware delay.

Rolespecific subratings live; attachments limited to previews/proxies;
private feedback channel.

Profile displays: overall & histogram, recent highlights, badges,
last90day ops stats, verified references.

Reputation Score computed per role with Bayesian/Wilson, recency
weighting, decay, and antigaming caps.

Buyer Rep visible to providers with components above; broadcast gates
enforced.

Incentives (streaks, fast responder, verification rewards) wired;
neutral reviewcompletion credits.

Moderation & appeals tooling: filters, evidence requests,
redaction/removal, public reply, SLAs.

Ranking integration and feature gates (Boost eligibility, Instant Book
thresholds, impression throttles).

Analytics & alerts for completion rate, toxicity, fairness, anomaly/ring
detection.

M\) Why this works

Trust you can see: Reviews are verified by bookings; objective ops stats
back up the story.

Fair to new users: Bayesian/Wilson and recency avoid "coldstart"
penalties and onereview whiplash.

Behavior improves: Streaks and small nudges reward what
matters---ontime, respectful, responsive, within scope.

Hard to game: Doubleblind, anomaly detection, and evidenceweighted
scoring blunt collusion and retaliation.

Brandsafe: Clear policy lines, 18+ gating for sensitive roles, and fast
moderation keep content and tone professional.

§3.8 --- Growth Loops & Retention

Goal: Turn first actions into habits and habits into repeat bookings.
Build crossside loops (buyers ↔ sellers), selfreinforcing trust loops
(verification → bookings → reviews → ranking), and content loops (feeds,
boards, case studies) --- without paywalls and without harming fairness.

A\) Principles

Value → habit: Every loop must deliver immediate value (leads, clarity,
or time saved) within a user's first 7--14 days.

Crossside by design: Features should create interactions that pull the
other side back (invites, tags, verified posts).

Trust amplifies growth: Verification, ontime behavior, and clean
delivery unlock visibility---not payment.

Polite, predictable comms: Fewer, better notifications with frequency
caps and onetap controls.

Roleaware, safe: One account, multiple roles; feeds and alerts respect
18+ Safe Mode and artisticonly policy.

B\) Lifecycle Model & Health Metrics (how we decide what to trigger)

Stages (per side):

New (days 0--7): Profile/brief created; hasn't sent a quote (seller) or
award (buyer).

Activated (days 7--30): ≥1 meaningful action (seller: Quick Quote sent;
buyer: Smart Invite/RFP sent).

Habit (30--90): ≥2 completed bookings; reply median ≤ 2h; repeat rate ≥
25%.

Risk: 14 days of inactivity and pending leads or saved searches.

Churn: 45 days no meaningful action.

Core health metrics:

Activation rate, time to first inquiry/quote/award, repeat bookings %,
time between bookings, saved search alerts → booking %, winback %.

C\) Core Loops (what pulls users back)

1\) Supplyside loops (sellers: Models/Photogs/Videographers/Creators)

Profile → Discovery → Lead → Quote → Booking → Review → Rank lift → More
Discovery

"Improve fit" hints on profile (pricefit index, missing ID, response
time) show impact estimate ("+12% more invites").

Tagging loop: after each booking, both parties can tag each other in
1--3 portfolio items; tagged approvals add those posts to both profiles
and surface to each other's followers.

Case study loop: postcompletion, onetap "Create case study" (cover + 3
images + 150 words). Case studies populate city/role showcases and boost
discovery.

Rebooking loop

Auto "Book again" button appears to the buyer 7/30/90 days after certain
packages (e.g., monthly content), prefilled with last scope + adjusted
dates.

2\) Demandside loops (buyers/brands)

Saved Search → Alert → Smart Invite/RFP → Compare → Award → Favorite →
Board revisit

Saved Searches with ANY/ALL filters (incl. social metrics, nudity tiers,
Verified/Trusted) send newmatch alerts (1/day max per search).

Board updates: when a profiled provider updates availability, gains a
badge, or posts a relevant case study, boards with that provider show a
"Fresh" chip and optional digest.

Template briefs: last 3 briefs saved as templates; 1click Reopen brief
and Rebroadcast (consumes credits per §3.5).

3\) Content loops (feeds & follow)

Follow → Feed → Inquiry → Booking → Tag → Feed

Single unified feed per user with role tabs
(Model/Photog/Vid/Creator/FanSub Creator). Posting is once, tagged by
role(s); viewers filter by role.

Feed pulls: new case studies, availability cards ("Now booking
Saturday"), touring chips ("Visiting Austin 11/20--11/22"), Verified
Studio open slots, and Verified influence posts delivered (SFW preview +
"Verified" tick).

Safe Mode default keeps 18+ content hidden until toggled; feed respects
nudity tiers & policy.

4\) Social share loop (offplatform → onplatform)

Sharecard generator: onetap export of profile/case study as socialready
images (IG/TT) with QR + booking link.

Linkinbio minisite (autogenerated) shows packages, availability, contact
CTA; UTM tags attribute inbound traffic.

5\) Verification loop (trust → visibility → bookings)

Completing ID unlocks Instant Book + DM credits → higher
inquiry→booking.

Trusted Pro (BG) grants fee nudge, RFP priority, Boost coupon → more
awards → more reviews → Rep Score up → ranking tiebreaks.

D\) Retention Features (per user type)

Sellers

Lead Inbox nudges: "Reply within 2h to keep Fast Responder badge."

Utilization alerts: "You have 4 open IB slots this weekend; enable
LastMinute Fill for +18% leads."

Smart "Raise price" hints when win rate \>70% and price well below city
median.

Touring assist: suggest nearby cities and dates based on follower
heatmap; autocreate "Visiting \[City\]" chip.

Buyers

Shortlist intelligence: "3 of your saved photogs now Instant Book next
Friday."

Availability windows: "Top models in your board opened 8--10pm Fri."

Budget guardrails: recommendations to adjust range for ≥3 qualified
responses.

"Book again" reminders synced to last project cadence.

E\) Referrals & Credits (twosided, abuseresistant)

Provider invites provider: both get +20 DM credits after invitee
publishes a package and completes 1 booking.

Buyer invites buyer: inviter gets 1 RFP credit when invitee posts a
brief and awards a booking.

Crossside referrals: if a provider invites a buyer who books them, both
get \$15 buyer credit toward next booking (used on buyer fee only).

Guardrails: peruser monthly caps; ID required to redeem; same device/IP
fraud detection; clawback if first booking is refunded for fraud.

F\) Saved Searches, Alerts & Digests

Saved search alerts: new matches batched 1/day/search; "turn off for 30
days" easy toggle.

Weekly city digest (optin): featured case studies, Verified Studios with
open slots, "Top rising creators" (Rep + recent growth).

Postbooking digest: 7 days after completion---review reminder, case
study prompt, "book again" CTA.

G\) Follows, Favorites & Boards (organization that retains)

Follow counts on profiles; Following tab shows only updates from
accounts you follow.

Favorites folders/Boards: draganddrop; status tags autoupdate
(Invited/Proposed/Awarded).

Share boards externally (readonly) with optional NDA gate; activity
pings when providers on a board go Verified or open IB slots.

H\) Notifications & Frequency Caps

Channels: inapp, email, push (optin), SMS (critical only).

Global caps: max 2 push/day, 3 email/week by default; digest merges
alerts.

User controls: pertopic toggles (Saved searches, Boards, Touring, Case
studies, Instant Book windows).

Quiet hours: localtime 10pm--8am (nonurgent push deferred).

Respect Safe Mode: 18+ gated content never appears in public emails;
only visible inapp with toggle ON.

I\) WinBack & Churn Save

Risk cohort (14 days idle): send "quick action" emails ("Publish 1
package template in 60s" / "Send 3 Smart Invites from your board").

Churn cohort (45 days idle): offer \$15 buyer credit or +20 DM credits
if they complete a booking within 14 days.

Exit survey on deactivation: reasons (price, low leads, complexity,
safety). Autocreate remedial tasks (e.g., "Enable ID to unlock IB").

Pause mode: let users pause discovery (hide from search) without
deleting; set autoresume.

J\) Feed & Posting (roleaware, one post → many views)

One composer with role tags; viewers filter by role.

Post types: Case study, Availability card, Touring card, "Looking
for..." (LFM/LFP rolegated), Verified promo delivered (SFW preview).

Ranking: follows → samecity trending → recommended (Repweighted).

Moderation: AI + human; artisticonly policy; Safe Mode hides 18+ until
toggled.

K\) Experiments (first 8--12 weeks)

Saved search alert frequency: immediate vs daily batch.

"Book again" reminder timing: +14 vs +30 days.

Case study autoprompt: shown at acceptance vs at review submission.

Referral reward mix: DM credits vs \$ buyer credits impact on bookings.

Feed ranking weights: followheavy vs citytrending weight.

Touring chip CTR: prominent vs subtle card.

L\) KPIs & Targets (90day per city)

Activation: sellers sending a first Quick Quote ≥ 55%; buyers sending a
first Smart Invite/RFP ≥ 60%.

Habit: ≥ 30% of activated users complete 2+ bookings in 60 days.

Repeat: ≥ 35% of bookings are repeat buyer↔provider pairings by month 6.

Saved searches: alert → click ≥ 18%; click → booking ≥ 6%.

Boards: ≥ 45% of active buyers maintain ≥1 board; board revisit rate ≥
2×/month.

Referrals: ≥ 15% of new users join via invite; fraud rate on referrals
\< 1%.

Winback: ≥ 12% of risk cohort reactivated; ≥ 8% of churn cohort return
within 30 days.

Feed: poster → inbound inquiry uplift ≥ 10% vs nonposters; toxicity \<
0.5%.

M\) Acceptance Criteria (mark 3.8 FINAL)

Saved searches with ANY/ALL logic (incl. social metrics and nudity
tiers), daily batched alerts, onetap unsubscribe.

Follows/Boards with status tags, external share links, and board refresh
"Fresh" chips.

Unified feed with role filters, Safe Mode gating, availability/touring
cards, case studies, verified promo posts.

Referral system (twosided) with caps, KYC gating, fraud checks, and
credit types (DM, RFP, buyer fee credit).

Rebooking buttons with prefilled scopes; brief templates and onetap
rebroadcasts.

Lead & utilization nudges, pricefit hints, touring assist.

Comms controls & caps (channels, quiet hours, Safe Mode email policy).

Winback flows for risk/churn; pause mode; exit survey & remediation
tasks.

Analytics: lifecycle stage dashboards, loop performance (saved search →
booking, referral ROAS, feed → inquiry).

N\) Why this works

Selfreinforcing: Each completed job seeds reviews, tags, case studies,
and "book again" triggers that bring both sides back.

Buyer clarity = speed: Saved searches, boards, and brief templates
shrink timetoaward.

Fair & safe: Visibility comes from trust and performance; Safe Mode
protects brand and compliance.

Costefficient: Credits (DM/RFP/buyer fee) and smart nudges drive
retention without monthly paywalls.

§3.9 --- Support, Refunds, Disputes & Knowledge Base

Goal: Resolve issues quickly and fairly, protect users in urgent
situations, keep most cases selfserve, and preserve trust & margins.
Make outcomes predictable (clear matrices), evidencebased (manifests,
checkin/out, verified posts), and brandsafe.

A\) Principles

Selfserve first, human when needed. Most changes/cancellations/refunds
can be initiated inthread and settled automatically under clear rules.

Evidence \> rhetoric. We rely on Delivery Room manifests, autochecks,
checkin/out, and Smart Docs to decide.

Timeboxed resolution. Cure windows and decision SLAs keep money and
media from lingering.

Safety has priority. P0 lifesafety routes to Safety team immediately;
fees are waived where appropriate.

Transparent playbook. The same refund matrix applies to everyone; it's
visible in the KB.

B\) Contact Channels & Triage

Channels (launch):

Inthread "Get help" (contextual flows for that booking).

Account Help (global: billing, verification, policy).

Email/webform fallback.

Triage & priority:

P0 --- Safety/Emergency (live/just occurred): response target ≤ 5 min,
24/7 oncall.

P1 --- Timecritical booking (\<24h): response ≤ 30 min during coverage
hours.

P2 --- Active booking / delivery in progress: ≤ 4 h.

P3 --- General/billing/policy: ≤ 1 business day.

Selfserve flows available from "Get help":

Change date/time, add/remove addons, adjust travel, request refund,
report noshow, report safety issue, delivery problem, chargeback info,
verification help.

C\) Refund & Adjustment Matrix (default policy)

Packages can raise/lower strictness within allowed bands; stricter terms
must be surfaced at checkout and inside Smart Docs.

1\) Cancellations & NoShows

2\) Delivery Shortfalls & Quality

3\) Influence/Promo Deliverables (IG/TT/YT/X)

4\) Travel & Location

Safety exception: If a party flags unsafe conduct (harassment, unsafe
set), we waive platform fees, refund appropriately, and open a Safety
case.

D\) Dispute Process (structured & fast)

Open from "Get help" → choose reason.

Collect evidence: system preattaches manifest, autochecks, checkin/out,
chat. Parties add statements & files.

Cure window: provider gets 48h for technical shortfalls; buyer gets 24h
to supply missing info (e.g., link URLs).

Neutral Review (if unresolved): trained specialists compare against
Smart Docs & manifest; may request targeted files only (no fishing).

Decision: prorata refunds, reedit orders, or uphold delivery.

Payouts adjust automatically; receipts reissued.

Appeal (facts or policy error only): ≤ 5 business days SLA.

E\) Chargebacks & Payments Ops

Prechargeback rescue: autopropose settlement to buyer if they initiate
dispute with their bank; surface evidence inapp.

Representment kit (if chargeback filed): signed SOW/release, manifest,
acceptance logs, checkin/out, comms timeline.

Fees: platform absorbs processor dispute fees unless clear abuse →
losing party may be charged a small dispute handling fee (see §3.1).

Risk dials: newprovider reserve; rolling reserves for highrisk cohorts;
Early Payout eligibility aligns with Rep ≥ 85 (see §3.2/§3.1).

Thresholds: keep chargeback ratio \<0.8%; above that → cohort risk
review; instant IB disable for outliers.

F\) Safety & Content Policy Escalations

SIRT (Safety Incident Response Team): oncall; responds ≤ 5 min to P0;
preserves evidence; may freeze funds.

Interim measures: temporary Instant Book disable, ad/boost suppression,
search visibility throttle.

Enforcement: threestrike model; immediate suspension for severe policy
breaches (e.g., explicit sexual content, violence, doxxing).

Law enforcement: cooperate under valid legal requests; strict privacy
controls.

G\) Knowledge Base (KB) & InProduct Help

KB structure (public):

Booking & Payments: escrow, milestones, payouts, fees, taxes.

Cancellations & Refunds: matrices, examples, timelines.

H\) Internal Tools (Agent Console)

Unified case view (thread + booking + payments + verification).

Oneclick outcomes: prorata refund %, reedit order, fee waivers.

Evidence viewer: manifests, checkin/out map, file autocheck results,
social verification logs.

Policy macros: cancellation matrix variants, safety scripts,
adverseaction (BG) templates.

Account controls: IB toggle, visibility throttle, boost suppress,
temporary hold.

Ledger safety: doubleentry adjustments; immutable audit log.

I\) SLAs, Coverage & Staffing

Coverage: Safety 24/7; general support 16×5 at launch (expand to 24×7 by
city #3).

Response targets: P0 ≤ 5 min; P1 ≤ 30 min; P2 ≤ 4 h; P3 ≤ 1 biz day.

Resolution targets: P1 ≤ 12 h; P2 ≤ 48 h; P3 ≤ 3 biz days.

Houston pilot staffing: 1 Safety lead (oncall rotation), 2--3
generalists (day/evening), parttime adjudicator for Neutral Reviews.

J\) Metrics & Guardrails

CSAT: ≥ 4.6/5; FRT & TTR on target per priority.

Autoresolution rate: ≥ 50% of cases resolved selfserve.

Refund leakage: within plan; buyer fee refunds only on provider
fault/safety.

Dispute reopen rate: \< 8%.

Chargeback ratio: \< 0.8%; representment win rate \> 55%.

Safety: P0 median ≤ 3 min, repeat offenders caught; policy violations \<
0.3% of bookings.

Fairness: outcomes distribution consistent across roles/cities (monitor
for bias).

K\) Acceptance Criteria (mark 3.9 FINAL)

Selfserve flows live: date/time change, addons, travel adj, refund
request, noshow, delivery problem, safety report.

Refund engine implements matrices above, with autocure windows and
prorata calculations.

Dispute center inthread: evidence collection, timers, Neutral Review
workflow, decision & receipts reissue.

Chargeback kit generator; reserves & IB gating rules wired.

Safety pipeline: P0 hotline, IB/boost suppress toggles, evidence
preservation.

KB published; inline tips & "Why this decision?" links live.

Agent console: macros, ledger adjustments, audit logs.

Analytics dashboards: CSAT, FRT/TTR, refund leakage, reopen, chargeback,
safety SLA.

L\) Why this works

Predictable & fair: Users see the same rules we apply; most outcomes are
obvious from the matrix.

Fast & scalable: Selfserve, timers, and autochecks keep humans for edge
cases.

Trustpreserving: Safety first, evidencedriven decisions, and fee
policies aligned with fault.

Marginaware: Buyer fee refunds only on provider fault; prorata logic
prevents overrefunds; chargeback playbooks contain losses.

Addendum --- §3.9 Support, Refunds, Disputes & Knowledge Base (Studios)
--- FINAL

Scope: Minimal but required clarifications so §3.9 cleanly covers Studio
bookings and Linked Booking Groups (Talent + Studio in one checkout),
without changing previously approved talent policies.

A\) SelfServe Flows (additions)

Add the following quick actions under Inthread ▸ Get help:

Studio ▸ Access issue (can't enter / code not working)

Studio ▸ Damage claim (hostinitiated; requires photos & description)

Studio ▸ Postbooking adjustment (overtime / crewsize overage / rule
violation)

Linked Group ▸ Propose reschedule (sync both bookings)

Linked Group ▸ Split or cancel (show sidebyside outcomes per policy)

B\) Refund Matrices (references & summary)

Talent cancellations & disputes: unchanged (see main §3.9 matrix).

Studio cancellations: use the Studio matrix (default bands: \>7d=100%
refund; 7--48h=50%; \<48h/noshow=0%).

Linked Booking Groups (LBG): outcomes are computed per booking and shown
in one summary (e.g., "Talent: 50% refund • Studio: 0% refund"). Support
agents use the LBG outcome view when editing/issuing refunds.

C\) Evidence Sets (studiospecific)

For Studio disputes we prioritize the following system evidence
(autoattached where available):

Checkin/out timestamps + geofence pass/fail.

House Rules & Property Release esign audit logs.

Access logs (door code release/time sent; if integrated).

Before/after photos (host; timestamped).

Overtime/overage indicators (End time vs booked End; crew count notes).

Calendar state at booking time (to counter "doublebooked" claims).

(For Talent deliverable disputes, continue using Delivery Room
manifests/autochecks as primary evidence.)

D\) Standard Outcomes (studiospecific)

Access failure (host fault): buyer full refund of studio; waive buyer
fee for that booking; goodwill credit allowed.

Amenity misrepresentation: cure if feasible (e.g., provide blackout
curtains), else partial refund aligned to value impact; repeat issues →
host strike.

Overtime/crew overage/rule violations: process via Postbooking
adjustment; approve with clear evidence; refund if host lacks evidence.

Damage claim: up to the deposit hold cap; see §H.

E\) SLAs & Timers (studiospecific)

Access issue (live) → P1 (≤ 30 min response; aim to resolve on the
spot).

Damage claim window: host must open ≤ 24h after checkout; buyer response
window 48h.

Adjustment window (overtime/overage): host opens ≤ 24h; buyer response
48h.

Neutral Review (if contested): decision target ≤ 5 business days.

F\) NoShow & Early Exit (studio)

Buyer noshow: apply Studio matrix (often 0% refund); deposit is not
captured unless damage/violation claimed.

Early exit: no prorata refunds unless host agrees; overtime may still
apply if late start pushes past booked end.

G\) Chargebacks (studio specifics)

Representment kit must include: checkin/out logs, rules/release
signatures, access log evidence, house rules, before/after photos, and
any approved adjustments.\
Deposit captures are separate charges; submit damage evidence with
capture receipt.

H\) Deposit Holds & Damage Claims (operational notes)

Authorize at checkout (or 24h prior, host setting); release
automatically 48h postcheckout if no claim.

On approved claim, capture partial/full up to cap; no platform fee on
captured amount (see §3.1 addendum).

Abuse guard: frequent denied claims reduce host visibility and may
remove deposit privileges.

I\) Knowledge Base (new/updated articles)

Add/refresh articles:

Studios 101: rules, access, deposits, cleaning fees, Instant Book vs
approval.

Attach a Studio to your shoot: how the inflow picker works; what "Linked
Booking Group" means.

Damage deposits & claims: timelines, evidence, how captures work.

Overtime & adjustments: what qualifies, how to dispute.

LBG refunds explained: examples showing different outcomes for Talent vs
Studio in one checkout.

All KB entries should link to corresponding policy matrices and timers
above.

J\) Agent Console (microtooling)

LBG outcome view: sidebyside (Talent \| Studio) with autocalc; one click
to apply both outcomes.

Deposit actions: authorize/void/capture with reason codes; evidence
viewer.

Templates: "Access failure (host remedy/credit)", "Adjustment
approved/denied", "Damage capture approved/denied".

Sanctions: toggle IB off for studio; reduce visibility; flag host for
quality review.

K\) Acceptance Criteria (mark §3.9 addendum FINAL)

New selfserve actions appear for Studio & LBG cases.

Studio matrix referenced & enforced; LBG summary surfaces perbooking
outcomes.

Evidence packs autoattach for Studio disputes (checkin/out, rules,
access, photos).

Deposit lifecycle supported in Support tooling (authorize/void/capture)
with audit logs.

Timers & SLAs implemented (24h/48h/5day) for claims/adjustments/neutral
review.

KB articles created/updated; links wired from help flows.

Agent console: LBG outcome view, deposit actions, message templates,
IB/visibility sanctions.

L\) Why this is "tiny" but necessary

It reuses §3.9 structure---just adds Studiospecific buttons, timers, and
evidence.

It keeps group bookings easy to explain and adjudicate: two bookings,
one summary.

It ensures deposits don't become support landmines (clear windows,
tools, and receipts).

Section 4 --- Product Architecture & Page Map

Goal: Define a coherent, scalable UX architecture that turns our
marketplace rules into screens and flows. Keep the system roleaware
(people vs places), cityaware, SafeModebydefault, and storagesane. Bake
in trust (verification ladder, reputation), fairness (no paytowin
ranking), and booking clarity (escrow, Smart Docs, Delivery Room).\
Studios launch as space listings (not roles): a subhub + AttachinFlow
(brief/checkout), with separate bookings and policies, tied by Linked
Booking Group when purchased with talent.

A\) What Section 4 guarantees (scope & outcomes)

Every jobtobedone has a page & path. Search, profile/listing, booking,
delivery, review, dispute---no "dead ends."

One account, many offerings. A user can operate multiple Service
Profiles (Model/Photographer/Videographer/Creator/FanSubscription
Creator) and optional Studio listings.

Clear separation of entity types. People (roles) vs Places (studios)
remain distinct in search, reviews, policies, and payouts.

Mobilefirst, desktopstrong. A tight 5icon mobile nav; desktop topbar +
action shortcuts; both share the same mental model.

Performance, safety, and accessibility are global requirements, not
afterthoughts.

B\) Core entities (objects the UX revolves around)

Account --- one login; owns assets and settings.

Service Profile (Role) --- personbased offering: Model / Photographer /
Videographer / Creator / FanSubscription Creator.

Studio Listing (Space) --- placebased offering; can earn Verified Studio
(Lite).

Search Query --- role selector + filters; saved search + alert cadence.

Board --- buyer's collection of candidates (talent and studios) with
statuses.

Brief / RFP --- buyer's scope; generates invites/broadcasts.

Booking --- Talent or Studio booking; each has escrow, policy, timeline,
documents.

Linked Booking Group (LBG) --- bundle of a Talent booking + Studio
booking in one checkout; independent rules, synchronized time.

Thread --- messaging with attachments, quotes, docs, decisions.

Smart Docs --- SOW/License/Release/Property & House Rules; esign;
autoamend.

Delivery --- Delivery Room manifest, previews/proxies, external links,
acceptance window.

Verification --- ID, Background (Trusted Pro), SocialVerified, Studio
Lite; badge ladder.

Reputation --- 0--100 score per role; separate space reputation for
studios.

Promotion --- optional paid boosts/featured (guardrailed).

Support Case --- refund/dispute/safety workflow with evidence packs.

C\) Crosscutting UX principles (apply everywhere)

Safe Mode default ON: gates 18+ people roles & feed; studios are never
18+ gated (content must remain SFW).

Roleaware everywhere: Search, cards, reviews, analytics all show the
relevant role/space context.

AttachinFlow: When a shoot brief has a time & city, suggest compatible
studios before checkout.

Evidencefirst resolution: manifests/checkin/out/autochecks \> rhetoric.

Storagesane: previews on platform; originals via
Drive/Dropbox/OneDrive/S3 links (captured as a manifest).

Accessibility (AA) & performance budgets: keyboardable filters, strong
contrast, TTI \< 2.5s on 3G Fast, route codesplitting.

Cityaware: location chips, city selector, and saved searches all obey
the current city context.

D\) Global flows (from first visit to review)

Discover → Home/Category/Case Studies → Search (role selector + filters)
→ Profile/Listing card → Message or Instant Book.

Plan → Brief (Quick/Full) → smart invites/RFP → Compare & Boards →
Award.

Book → Checkout (escrow, docs) → (optional) Attach a Studio → Payment →
confirmation.

Work → Thread (prep) → Checkin/out (time evidence) → Delivery Room →
Acceptance.

Close → Payout → Doubleblind Reviews → Reputation updates → Growth loops
(follow/favorite/feed/case study).

If needed → Refund/Dispute/Safety → outcome per matrix with evidence.

E\) Surface families (we'll enumerate pages in §4.0)

Public

Landing, Category hubs (roles + Verified Studios (Lite) subhub), Search,
Profile (role), Studio Detail (space), Case Studies, Help Center, Auth.

Buyer

Brief Composer (Quick/Full), Compare/Award, Boards, Threads/Messages,
Checkout, LBG Summary, Delivery (read), Smart Docs (read/sign), Buyer
Dashboard (spend, teams).

Seller (roles)

Onboarding wizard (per role), Packages/Addons, Portfolio/Tagging,
Availability/Calendar, Threads, Delivery (author), Smart Docs
(author/sign), Seller Dashboard (analytics, payouts).

Host (studios)

Create/Edit Studio listing (wizard), Studio Dashboard (calendar, rules,
bookings, deposits, claims), Verification Lite status.

Crosscutting

Notifications, Verification Center, Payments & Tax, Settings & Privacy,
Support/Dispute Center.

Admin (essentials)

Support console, Safety, Promotions config, Verification review.

F\) Navigation model (the contract; full spec later in §4.1)

Desktop header: Logo • Browse (roles + Verified Studios (Lite)) • Search
• Boards/Packages (context) • Messages • Notifications • Create • Safe
Mode toggle • City • Account.

Mobile tab bar: Home • Search • Create • Messages • Profile.

Create adapts: Buyer (Brief), Seller (Package/Post), Host (Studio
Listing).

G\) Ranking & fairness contract

Result order = relevance → availability → distance → price fit → Rep
tiebreak → tiny nudges (Verified/Trusted/Studio).

Promotions never bypass filters; density caps (e.g., ≤2 in top 20) and
"Promoted" labels are mandatory.

Eligibility gates: IDVerified, Rep ≥ threshold; safety strikes suppress
IB and paid delivery.

H\) Global system rules we won't violate

Separate bookings & ledgers for Talent vs Studio (even in one checkout).

Pertype policies (refunds, deposits) applied independently; the UI shows
one LBG outcome summary to the user.

No forced subscriptions at launch; monetization is takerate + optional
boosts, verification addons, and peruse Early Payout.

I\) Performance, privacy, and safety baselines

Perf: image lazyload, skeleton cards, background prefetch for next
route, defer OAuth SDKs until needed.

Privacy: exact addresses hidden until confirmation; studio surveillance
disclosures required; minors require guardian docs.

Safety: P0 hotline, checkin/out evidence, hazard toggles inject Safety
Addendum, instant IB/boost suppression during investigations.

J\) Analytics & observability (event families)

Nav & search: nav.click, search.open, search.apply_filters,
saved_search.create/alert.open.

Discovery & boards: board.add, compare.open, invite.send, rfp.broadcast.

Bookings: booking.create.talent\|studio, booking.group.linked/split,
checkout.complete.

Docs & delivery: doc.esign, delivery.manifest_pinned,
delivery.accepted/auto_accept.

Reputation: review.submit, rep.update, strike.add/remove.

Studios: studio.create/publish/verify_lite,
studio.deposit.authorize/capture/release,
studio.adjustment.open/resolve.

Promotions: boost.purchase, featured.book.

Support: dispute.open/resolve, chargeback.open/represent.

All events include role_or_listing_type, city, and user cohort tags for
citybycity rollout measurement.

K\) Risks & mitigations (known issues, bakedin controls)

Scope creep with Studios → Mitigation: subhub + attachinflow only;
capped city inventory; clear KPIs/killswitch.

Policy confusion in LBG → Mitigation: separate booking lines, sidebyside
outcomes, pertype receipts.

Growth vs brand safety → Mitigation: Safe Mode default; artisticonly
policy; clear surveillance & hazard disclosures.

Infra cost (media) → Mitigation: previews only; externallink manifest;
virus scan on previews; cap perthread size.

Fairness perception → Mitigation: transparent ranking rules; labeled
promotions; eligibility gates.

L\) Acceptance Criteria (mark Section 4 FINAL)

Entity model (Account, Service Profile, Studio Listing, Booking, LBG,
Thread, Smart Docs, Delivery, Verification, Reputation, Promotion,
Support Case) defined and referenced consistently.

Global flows (Discover → Plan → Book → Work → Close → Support)
documented with no missing steps.

Surface families enumerated (public/buyer/seller/host/cross/admin) to
drive the Page Map in §4.0.

Nav model defined (desktop/mobile) with Safe Mode and city context
always accessible.

Ranking & fairness contract documented (relevance first; promotions
capped & labeled).

Safety/privacy/perf baselines established (Safe Mode, address privacy,
hazard toggles, perf budgets).

Analytics event families declared (to wire telemetry from day one).

Studios confirmed as space listings with subhub + AttachinFlow only at
launch; LBG contract in place.

Nongoals (full venue marketplace features) explicitly excluded from
launch scope.

M\) Why this works

Clarity → speed: Clean entities and flows make the UI obvious and the
marketplace predictable.

Scales by addition, not revision: New roles or more studio inventory
slot into the same model.

Trust is structural: Verification, Safe Mode, and separate booking
ledgers are baked into the architecture, not bolted on.

Launchable: We can ship citybycity with confidence and expand without
rewiring the product.

§4.0 --- Page Map (HighLevel)

Contract: Every user task has a screen and a clear next step. Pages are
grouped by Public, Buyer, Seller (roles), Host (studios), Crosscutting,
and Admin. Each entry lists route pattern, owner, key sections, and
primary CTAs. Mobile uses the same routes; some interactions open as
drawers/modals.

A\) Routing & Guardrails (global)

Route shape: kebabcase; city context as query (?city=houston) or chip;
IDs as slugs.

Auth gates: actions that create/modify bookings or messages route
through /auth with return URL.

Safe Mode: default ON. Hides FanSubscription Creator role & 18+ nudity
tiers; studios are unaffected (SFW media only).

City awareness: city selector persistent; saved to profile/cookie.

Error routes: /404, /403, /maintenance.

SEO: canonical URLs & city/role landing pages (see Public).

J\) Critical Empty States & Skeletons

Search empty: show relaxfilters tips, nearby neighborhoods, role switch.

Profile with no packages: onboarding card "Create your first package."

Studio with no slots: prompt to add schedule; hide IB until set.

Boards empty: prompt to add from search; suggest saved search.

Delivery Room empty: manifest placeholder; externallink guidance.

Support center empty: point to KB and mostused selfserve flows.

K\) Acceptance Criteria (mark §4.0 FINAL)

All pages above have defined routes, owners, key sections, and primary
CTAs.

Studios exist as: /studios hub, /studio/{slug} detail, Create/Edit,
Dashboard, and AttachinFlow drawer.

Linked Booking Group has a dedicated checkout summary and refund outcome
presentation.

Safe Mode is globally present; FanSubscription Creator routes are gated;
studios remain visible (SFW only).

Delivery Room, Smart Docs, and Support flows are reachable from
bookings.

Buyer, Seller, Host, and Admin surfaces cover onboarding → booking →
delivery → review → dispute without dead ends.

Modals/drawers defined for all timesensitive tasks (attach, quote,
reschedule, claims).

City ops & promotions admin routes exist to tune CPC floors, featured
pricing, and city launch flags.

L\) Why this Page Map works

Nothing missing: Every accepted feature from Sections 1--3 has a page, a
route, and a CTA.

People vs Places clarity: Service Profiles vs Studios are cleanly
separated yet connect via AttachinFlow.

Launchable & scalable: Focuses on Houstonfirst while keeping the IA
ready for multicity expansion and future categories.

Trust & safety are visible: Docs, deposits, checkin/out, and dispute
paths are firstclass---not hidden.

§4.1 --- Global Information Architecture & Navigation

Contract: Make it obvious where to go for any task. Keep People vs
Places distinct in IA, keep city & Safe Mode always available, and keep
create actions contextual (buyer vs seller vs host). All navigation
choices must support the Houstonfirst rollout and scale to multicity.

A\) IA Overview (mental model & global state)

Entities:

People (Service Profiles / roles): Model • Photographer • Videographer •
Creator • FanSubscription Creator

Places (Space listings): Studio (can be Verified Studio via Studio Lite)

Global state persistent in nav: City (chip), Safe Mode (toggle), Auth
(account), Search entry.

Discover → Plan → Book → Work → Close → Support flows are reachable from
any context within ≤2 clicks/taps.

B\) Desktop Navigation (top bar + browse)

Top bar (left → right)

Logo → Home (cityaware modules)

Browse (megamenu; hover/click)

People: Models • Photographers • Videographers • Creators •
FanSubscription Creators (18+)

Places: Verified Studios (Lite) (subhub; not a toplevel pillar)

By City: quick list (current city first)

Case Studies

Search (prominent) → opens Role/Listing selector + filters drawer

Context area (autoswitches by user type and current route)

Buyer context: Boards

Seller context: Packages

Host context: Studios (quick link to studio dashboard)

If multirole: a small dropdown to switch the context link (Boards \|
Packages \| Studios)

Messages (badge)

Notifications (bell; grouped)

Create (primary CTA dropdown; contextaware)

Buyer: New Brief (Quick) • New Brief (Full)

Seller: New Package • New Post (case study/availability)

Host: New Studio Listing

Safe Mode toggle (default ON; age confirm required to OFF)

City selector (Houston default; typeahead)

Account menu

Profile switcher (tabs: Model, Photographer, Videographer, Creator,
FanSub Creator, Studio host)

Buyer Dashboard • Seller Dashboard • Studio Dashboard

Verification Center • Payments & Tax • Settings • Help • Sign out

Header behavior

Sticky on scroll; Search and Create remain visible.

When viewing saved searches/boards, a context bar under the header shows
chips for active filters and provides Save / Edit controls.

C\) Mobile Navigation (tab bar + overflow)

Bottom tab bar (5 items)

Home (cityaware feed + modules)

Search (role selector + filters drawer)

Create (FAB; buyer/seller/host contextual)

Messages

Header controls (mobile)

City chip left; Safe Mode shield icon right (tap → age confirm +
toggle).

Overflow (⋯) menu: Boards, Notifications, Verification, Payments,
Settings, Help.

Sticky action bars

On Profile/Studio detail: sticky Book/Request bar.

On Search: sticky Filters / Save bar.

On Checkout: sticky Pay & Confirm bar.

D\) Search Entry Pattern (everywhere consistent)

Clicking/tapping Search opens a compact selector with six tabs:\
Model \| Photographer \| Videographer \| Creator \| FanSub Creator \|
Studio

Tabs = People (first five) and Places (Studio) --- visually separated
with a divider label.

Filters drawer (right on desktop; fullscreen on mobile) includes:

Common: city/radius, availability window, budget/price, distance,
minimum Rep, Verified/Trusted toggles.

Rolespecific (People): look & comfort (models/creators), specialties &
deliverables (photographers/videographers), promo posting windows
(FanSub Creators), perplatform social metrics (IG/YT/TT/X).

Studio (Places): price/hr, min hours, capacity, creative amenities
(natural light, cyc wall, blackout, ceiling height, loadin/parking,
makeup/dressing room, grip/lighting, etc.), Instant Book, Verified
Studio toggles.

Saved Search: clearly visible Save button with cadence control (daily
batch); confirm sheet explains alerts & Safe Mode behavior.

AttachinFlow pill: when a People search includes date/time, show "Attach
a Studio" pill above results; opens a prefiltered Studio drawer.

E\) Context Switching & Role/Host Awareness

Profile switcher (Account menu on desktop; top segmented control on
mobile Profile) lists all enabled roles and Studio host if the account
has at least one studio listing.

Context link in the header (Boards \| Packages \| Studios) automatically
reflects the most relevant workspace for the current route; quick
dropdown to change it.

Create menu always matches the current persona: posting a brief (buyer),
creating a package/post (seller), or adding a studio (host).

F\) Where key actions live (global "where do I...?" map)

View & edit my offerings (People): Account ▸ Seller Dashboard ▸
Packages/Portfolio/Calendar.

Create a studio listing (Places): Create ▸ New Studio Listing → wizard;
manage via Studio Dashboard.

Post a brief (buyers): Create ▸ New Brief (Quick/Full); invite or
broadcast from the brief.

Attach a studio to a shoot: From Brief or Talent Checkout, tap Attach a
Studio (drawer) → returns a Linked Booking Group summary.

Find inspiration: Browse ▸ Case Studies; deep link to People & Places.

Get help: Thread ▸ Get help (contextual flows) or Help Center.

G\) Safe Mode & Gating (global)

Default ON for guests and new users.

People: FanSubscription Creator and profiles with nudity tiers beyond
"Lingerie/Swim" are hidden when Safe Mode is ON.

Places (Studios): never gated by Safe Mode (studio media must remain
SFW).

Emails/push: never include 18+ previews; 18+ content visible inapp only
with Safe Mode OFF.

H\) CrossLinks & Shortcuts (reduce path length)

Profile → Invite opens Smart Invite prefilled with role, city, date
window.

Talent profile with linked studio shows "Owns/Has Studio" chip → deep
link to the Studio detail.

Studio detail shows Host card → deep link to host's People profile(s).

Boards cards expose Compare, Invite, Attach Studio, Book shortcuts.

Case Study tiles link to both the talent and any tagged studio.

I\) Header Context Bar (chips below header)

Appears on Search, Saved Search, Boards, Brief, Compare.

Shows active filter chips, city/date/time chips, and Saved state; inline
Edit and Clear actions.

On Linked Booking Group checkout, shows a twochip summary: Talent \|
Studio (tap to expand each).

J\) Error States & Auth Walls (consistent pattern)

Authrequired actions (book, message, create) route through /auth with a
return URL; copy explains benefits and Safe Mode.

404 gracefully links to Search by role with city preselected.

403 uses policy copy (e.g., 18+ gating, suspended features); provides
Help link.

K\) Accessibility, Localization & Performance (global baselines)

AA: keyboard navigable menus & drawers; ARIA on tabs/filters; obvious
focus states; colorcontrast linting in CI.

Localization: strings via i18n; USEnglish at launch; localeaware
currency/date.

Performance: routebased code splitting; image lazyload; deferral of
OAuth SDKs until needed; search TTI \< 2.5s on 3G Fast.

L\) Telemetry (navigation & IA events)

nav.click (item, location), browse.open (section), search.open
(tab=role\|studio), filters.open/apply, saved_search.create/toggle,\
context.switch (Boards\|Packages\|Studios), create.open
(brief\|package\|studio), safe_mode.toggle, city.change,\
attach_studio.open/select, lbg.checkout.open, header_context_chip.click.

M\) Acceptance Criteria (mark 4.1 FINAL)

Desktop header implements Browse, Search, Context link
(Boards/Packages/Studios), Messages, Notifications, Create, Safe Mode,
City, Account with Profile switcher.

Mobile tab bar implements Home, Search, Create, Messages, Profile;
overflow contains Boards, Notifications, Verification, Payments,
Settings, Help.

Role/Listing selector in Search includes
Model/Photographer/Videographer/Creator/FanSub Creator/Studio with
People vs Places divider; filters drawers reflect rolespecific vs
studiospecific fields.

Attach a Studio pill appears only when a People search has date/time;
opens a prefiltered Studio drawer; selected studio persists to Linked
Booking Group checkout.

Safe Mode default ON; hides FanSub Creator and nuditybeyondLingerie for
People; does not hide Studios; email/push remain 18+safe.

Context switching works: Profile switcher (roles + host), header context
link (Boards/Packages/Studios), Create menu adapts to persona.

Crosslinks: People↔Studio chips; Invite from profile; Board shortcuts;
Case Study deep links.

Header context bar shows active chips and supports Save/Edit/Clear; LBG
shows twochip summary.

Auth walls and error states follow the documented patterns;
accessibility, i18n, and performance budgets enforced.

All telemetry events above are emitted for
nav/search/safemode/create/context interactions.

N\) Why this IA works

People vs Places clarity: Users always know whether they're looking at a
person or a space, yet can combine them fluidly via AttachinFlow.

Contextual creation: The Create menu and the context link reduce
cognitive load for multirole/host users.

Safety & brand protection: Safe Mode is omnipresent and conservative by
default; studios stay visible but SFW.

Scalable: Adds cities, roles, or more studio inventory without changing
the mental model.

Fast paths: Crosslinks and sticky action bars trim steps from discovery
to booking.

§4.2 --- Global Components & Design System

Goal: Ship a coherent, performant, accessible component library that
makes every flow in §4.0/§4.1 consistent and fast to build. Components

Policies: use plain language ("Cancel by 7 days for full refund").

Safety: avoid alarmist tones; be clear ("House rules apply; cameras must
be disclosed").

Email/push: never show 18+ previews; SFW copy only.

E\) Accessibility & Error Patterns

AA Contrast for all text & icons; verify with tooling in CI.

Keyboard & Screen Readers: focus trap in modals, labeled inputs, ARIA on
tabs/drawers, logical heading order.

Hit targets: 44×44 px minimum.

Errors: inline + summary; link to KB where relevant; keep technical
jargon out of user copy.

F\) Performance & Media Guidelines

Images: lazyload, responsive srcset, WebP/AVIF where supported; max card
image \~120--200KB.

Video: autogenerate lightweight proxies (muted, no autoplay on mobile);
never embed heavy originals.

Icons: sprite or treeshaken; defer OAuth SDKs until user opens Social
Connect.

Skeletons: render within 100ms to reduce perceived latency.

G\) Telemetry (componentlevel events)

H\) Acceptance Criteria (mark 4.2 FINAL)

Foundations (tokens, type, spacing, breakpoints, motion) defined and
consumable.

Core components delivered: PersonCard, StudioCard, BoardCard,
CaseStudyCard, SkeletonCard.

Chips & badges for Verified, Trusted Pro, Verified Studio, Instant Book,
Social metrics, Promoted.

Search patterns: SearchBar, FilterDrawer (people + studio), Saved
Search, ANY/ALL social logic, Verifiedonly toggle.

Modals/Drawers implemented: Quick Brief, Attach a Studio, Quick Quote,
Change Order, PostBooking Adjustment, Damage Claim, Reschedule, Review
Composer, Safe Mode Toggle, Payment Method, OAuth Connect.

Delivery Room & Smart Docs components complete and reused in all flows.

Reputation & Reviews components wired to ranking tiebreaks and profile
displays.

Verification Center components (ID, BG, Social, Studio Lite) with unlock
blurbs.

Calendars, Checkout, Notifications/Toasts, Admin split views ready;
deposit actions supported.

Accessibility (AA) & performance budgets enforced; telemetry events
instrumented.

I\) Why this works

Consistency → speed: One library powers all surfaces---less time
prototyping, more time validating.

Clarity of types: People vs Places appear distinct (but complementary)
across cards, filters, and checkout.

Safety & fairness are visible: Badges, verified chips, Promoted labels,
and policy snippets make trust legible and ads honest.

Mobilefirst: Drawers, sticky bars, and concise cards keep flows fast on
phones.

§4.3 --- Auth & Onboarding Flows

Goal: Move new users from "curious" → first meaningful action fast, with
minimal friction and role/space awareness. Keep Safe Mode ON by default,
defer heavier checks (ID, Background, Studio Lite) until they unlock
value (Instant Book, badges, DM credits), and support multirole + studio
under one account.

A\) Principles

Fast path first: Light signin, ask current city, and immediately route
to a next action (Search, Quick Brief, Quick Package, or New Studio).

One account → many offerings: Users can create Service Profiles (roles)
and Studio Listings (spaces) under a single login.

Progressive verification: Verification is optional at first, but clearly
rewards users (Instant Book, DM credit boosts, badges, Early Payout
eligibility).

Safe by default: Safe Mode ON; FanSubscription Creator is agegated;
minors operate via guardian/agency (Phase 2).

Save & resume: All wizards autosave; deep links return to the exact
step.

Measure activation: Instrument "timetofirst": Saved Search / Quick Brief
/ Package publish / Studio publish.

B\) Auth (signup / signin)

Entry points

Header Sign in / Create account, plus intercepts on Book, Message,
Create actions.

Deep links preserve return URL.

Methods

Email passcode / magic link

Apple (native/app + web)

Google (web)

Phone SMS (optional; recommended for providers/hosts to unlock extra DM
credits)

First capture (all users)

Display name (public alias allowed; legal name later for payouts)

City (typeahead; defaults from IP) & Timezone

Safe Mode = ON (explain; can toggle later)

Intent chips (choose any; sets next route):

Book talent / studios (buyer path)

List my services (seller path)

List my studio (host path)

Age & policy gates

To create a FanSubscription Creator profile or toggle Safe Mode OFF,
user confirms 18+ (timestamped).

Launch policy: Accounts are 18+; minors only via guardian/agencymanaged
accounts (Phase 2). Studio media must be SFW.

C\) Buyer Onboarding (Bookers/Brands)

1\) Welcome choices (one tap):

Start a Quick Brief (30--60s)

Search now (roleselector preset to current city)

Save a Search template (e.g., "Models in Houston this weekend")

2\) Quick Brief (drawer):

Role, city, date/time, budget, deliverables, Attach Studio toggle

Send Smart Invites (top matches) or Broadcast RFP (credits)

Creates a Buyer Dashboard tile for the brief

3\) Saved Search helper:

Offer 2--3 presets by role; daily alerts ON by default (user can adjust
cadence)

Buyer activation (success state):

Completed Quick Brief or saved first search or sent ≥1 Smart Invite.

D\) Seller Onboarding (Service Profiles: Model / Photographer /
Videographer / Creator / FanSub Creator)

Entry: "List my services" → Role picker (multiselect allowed; wizard
runs per role)

Wizard (per role)

Essentials

Display name (public), city, travel radius; portfolio starter (3--6
images; +1 video for video roles)

Models/Creators: look & comfort fields (height, hair, measurements,
Nudity tier), chaperone policy

Photographers/Videographers: specialties, deliverables, turnaround

FanSub Creators: platform links, promo offerings, posting
windows/minlive acknowledgement

checkout, invite shortlisted talent.

J\) Edge Cases & Safeguards

Abandoned wizards autosave and email/push resume links.

Duplicate detection (People/Studios): softmatch (name/phone/city);
claim/merge flow.

Name privacy: public alias allowed; legal name used only for
payouts/verification.

Content policy: portfolio uploader enforces artisticonly; SafeModeaware
previews.

Accessibility: wizards are keyboardable, show step counts, and preserve
focus on validation errors.

Fraud gates: new accounts may have payout reserves (per §3.1).

K\) Metrics (per city, first 90 days)

Auth → first action conversion ≥ 65%

Buyer activation (Quick Brief or Saved Search) ≥ 60%

Seller activation (Package publish or Quick Quote) ≥ 55%

Host activation (Studio publish) ≥ 35%

Timetofirst inquiry median: ≤ 3 days (seller), ≤ 7 days (host)

Verification adoption by day 30: ID ≥ 60% (active sellers), Studio Lite
≥ 50% (active hosts)

Step dropoff \< 20% at any wizard step

L\) Acceptance Criteria (mark 4.3 FINAL)

Auth supports Email/Apple/Google (+ optional SMS), return URLs, city
capture, Safe Mode default ON, and intent routing (buyer/seller/host).

Buyer onboarding provides Quick Brief, Search, and Saved Search; Smart
Invites/Broadcast RFP work from Quick Brief.

Seller wizard (per role) collects essentials, packages, availability;
exposes IB/verification unlocks; publishes searchable profiles.

Host wizard collects amenities, rules, pricing, schedule; supports
deposit holds; Studio Lite step; publishes studios.

Linking: People ↔ owned Studio chip; host card on studio detail.

Verification Center: ID, Background, Social, Studio Lite with explicit

Safe Mode & FanSub gating enforced during onboarding; SFW previews on
public surfaces.

Save & resume and duplicate detection implemented; alias vs legal name
handled.

Activation metrics instrumented and visible in city rollout dashboards.

M\) Why this works

Fast to value: Buyers can send invites within a minute; sellers can
publish a bookable package in one sitting; hosts can list a studio with
clear expectations.

Low friction, high trust: Heavy checks are optional but clearly
rewarding (IB, DM credits, badges, Early Payout).

One account, many hats: Multirole + studio is natural, with simple
linking and context switching.

Measurable & tunable: Activation KPIs let us iterate quickly citybycity.

§4.4 --- Role Profiles (Public & Owner Views)

Goal: Make every role profile a hightrust, bookable storefront that's

About, Reviews, Updates, Policies), rightrail modules, and sticky
Book/Request on mobile.

Owner editor provides Portfolio, Packages, About, Availability,
Policies, Updates, Reviews, Analytics, Link a Studio, and Verification
nudges.

Telemetry events fire as listed; performance & accessibility targets
met.

L\) Why this works

Bookable storefronts: Every role's page converts (clear packages,
availability, and CTAs).

Signalrich but simple: Badges, social chips, and a transparent Rep score
reduce risk without clutter.

Multirole clarity: Each role stands on its own merit; switching is
explicit; reviews/reputation never mix.

Network effects: Tagging, case studies, and follows tie profiles
together, lifting discovery and retention.

§4.5 --- Studio Listing (Public & Host Views)

Goal: Make studios a clean, trustworthy, creativeready space type that
buyers can book in minutes or attach to a talent checkout---without
turning the product into a venue marketplace. Keep policies, payouts,

Public studio detail page includes Header (price/hr, min hours,
capacity, Verified Studio, Instant Book), Gallery, Quick Facts,
Amenities, Rules, Availability, Pricing, Host, Location (approx),
Reviews, Pair with Talent module.

Booking widget: date/time & duration, crew size, cleaning fee, deposit
info, Smart Docs preview, IB/Request logic, clear price breakdown.

Create/Edit wizard implements Basics, Media, Amenities, Rules
(surveillance/hazards), Pricing & Schedule, Deposits & Docs,
Verification Lite, Review & Publish.

Host dashboard provides Calendar, Bookings, Messages, PostBooking
Adjustments, Damage Claims, Rules editor, Verification status,
Promotions, Analytics.

Scheduling supports min hours, buffers, IB windows, blackout dates;
doublebooking protection at payment.

Pricing & fees follow §3.1; deposit holds are authorizations (not GMV);
overtime/overage adjustments implemented with evidence windows.

Policies & safety enforced: studio refund matrix, Smart Docs esign
before access, geofenced checkin/out, surveillance rules, address
privacy.

AttachinFlow works both directions (from talent checkout drawer and from
studio page to People search) creating a Linked Booking Group at
checkout.

Accessibility/Performance budgets met; Telemetry events fire.

N\) Why this works

Clear separation: Studios behave like spaces with their own rules,
deposits, and reviews---no confusion with people roles.

Frictionless planning: Buyers can attach a studio during talent checkout
or start from a studio and find matching talent.

Trust builtin: Verification Lite, Smart Docs, deposits, and checkin/out
create predictable, evidencefirst resolution paths.

Launchready: Tight scope avoids venuemarketplace bloat while delivering
the features creators actually need to shoot.

§4.6 --- Search & Results (Roleaware + Studios)

Goal: Make search fast, fair, and creatorspecific. Keep People (roles)
and Places (Studios) distinct but easy to combine. Surface the right
filters for each role, enable perplatform social targeting, and support
AttachinFlow so buyers can add a Studio to a talent checkout in one
pass.

A\) Entry Points & Routes

Global Search header button → /search?role={role}&city={city}

Category hubs (e.g., /photographers) deeplink to search prefiltered by
role & city.

Studio hub /studios?city={city} is a specialized search for Studios
(grid + optional map).

AttachinFlow (from Brief/Checkout): opens a Studio drawer preseeded with
city/date/time.

Saved Search links open the same route with filters applied.

Safe Mode is ON by default and gates People results that exceed
"Lingerie/Swim"; Studios are not gated (SFW media only).

B\) Layout (Desktop & Mobile)

Desktop

Left: Filter drawer (collapsible).

Center: Results list (cards) with infinite scroll.

Right: Optional map toggle (pins show price or a role icon).

Top: Role/Listing selector tabs (Model • Photographer • Videographer •
Creator • FanSub Creator • Studio), City chip, Date/Time pill, Save
Search.

Mobile

Role tabs at top; Filters opens fullscreen; map toggles within results.

Sticky bar presents Filters, Save, and (for talent with date/time)
Attach a Studio pill.

Skeletons render immediately; results stream in batches.

C\) Role/Listing Selector & Gating

Tabs: People (Model • Photographer • Videographer • Creator • FanSub
Creator) and Places (Studio) separated by a small label.

Safe Mode ON hides FanSubscription Creator and People results with
nudity tiers beyond "Lingerie/Swim."

Switching to Studio shows Studiospecific filters and never reveals
explicit content.

D\) Filters

Schedule: date/time slot selector; bufferfriendly windows

E\) Social Metrics Panel (People roles; perplatform targeting)

Platforms: IG • YT • TT • X (launch).

Filters per platform: Followers (min--max), Engagement Rate (min %), Avg
views (YT/TT), 30/90day growth (min %).

Logic: Match ANY (default) or Match ALL selected platforms.

Verification: Verifiedonly (default) uses connectedaccount metrics;
toggle Include selfreported to expand results (unverified numbers are
labeled).

Freshness: nightly sync; user can Refresh metrics up to 3×/day
platformwide (ratelimited).

Explainers: tooltip "Followers ≠ engagement" + definitions of ER per
platform.

Cards show compact chips like IG 182k • 2.8% ER / TT 520k • 110k avg
views with a tiny verified tick when sourced via API.

F\) Results List, Map & Cards

Cards: PersonCard(role) or StudioCard (from §4.2).

Promotions: clearlylabeled Promoted units appear within capped slots (≤
2 in top 20, ≤ 1 above the fold); they must match filters.

Map pins: price or role icon; hover/press syncs with the card; keyboard
accessible.

Inline actions: Message, Add to Board, View, Invite (from buyer brief
context).

AttachinFlow (talent searches with date/time): a blue pill "Attach a
Studio" appears above the list; opens the prefiltered Studio drawer (top
3 suggestions inline).

Empty states:

Show nearby neighborhoods, "widen radius," "adjust budget," "broaden
date window," or switch role.

Offer a Save Search with current filters.

G\) Sorting & Ranking

Sort options: Best match (default) • Price • Distance • Availability
first • Rating • Reputation.

Ranking (default Best match):

Exact filter fit (role/amenities/social thresholds)

Availability match (date/time fit; for studios, slot + min hours; for
people, IB window or calendar)

Distance (within radius)

Price fit (within selected or inferred range)

Reputation Score (rolespecific; studiospecific for spaces)

Tiebreak nudges: Verified/Trusted/Verified Studio • Instant Book •
Freshness (recent calendar update)

Fairness: Paid units never bypass filter or ranking contract; they
occupy their own labeled, capped slots.

H\) Saved Searches & Alerts

Save Search captures all filters (including social panel logic); users
name it and pick alert cadence (daily batch by default).

Email/push previews respect Safe Mode (no 18+ imagery).

Management: /saved-searches lets users rename, change cadence, or
delete.

I\) Boards, Compare & Brief Integration

Add to Board from any card; boards can mix People & Studios (type badges
visible).

Compare (from a board or brief): sidebyside with key fields and rep.

Invite (buyer context): from search cards directly send Smart Invites;
prefills brief context.

Attach a Studio: from talent search with date/time or from brief review
step.

J\) Performance, Accessibility & Quality

Performance: route codesplit; image srcset + lazyload; skeletons render
within 100ms; target TTI \< 2.5s on 3G Fast.

Accessibility: keyboardable filters & map; ARIA tabs; clear focus
states; card actions readable by screen readers.

Quality: show "metrics stale" badge if social metrics \> 72h old;
"calendar stale" badge if not updated for 30 days (optional nudge).

K\) Telemetry

search.open (role\|studio) • filters.open/apply/reset • sort.change •
map.toggle

social_panel.apply (platforms, any\|all, verified_only=true\|false) •
metrics.refresh

L\) Acceptance Criteria (mark 4.6 FINAL)

Role/Listing tabs implement
Model/Photographer/Videographer/Creator/FanSub Creator/Studio with
SafeMode gating for FanSub & beyondLingerie People.

Filter sets delivered for each role and for Studio (amenities, min
hours, etc.); Common filters present across all.

Social Metrics Panel supports perplatform followers/ER/avg views/growth;
ANY/ALL logic; Verifiedonly default with Include selfreported toggle;
nightly sync + manual refresh (3×/day).

Results list uses PersonCard / StudioCard; Promoted units are labeled
and capped (≤2/20; ≤1 above fold).

Attach a Studio pill appears when a People search includes date/time;
drawer shows prefiltered studios; selection persists to checkout as
Linked Booking Group.

Sorting & ranking match the contract: relevance → availability →
distance → price fit → reputation → small nudges; paid never overrides
filters.

Saved Search with cadence (daily batch) implemented; management page
exists.

Boards/Compare/Invite shortcuts work from cards; boards accept mixed
types.

Performance & accessibility budgets met; skeletons present; map
optional; staledata badges visible.

Telemetry events fire as listed.

M\) Why this works

Roletrue filtering: Buyers get the exact knobs that matter for each role
(and studios), not gear trivia.

Social clarity: Perplatform targeting with verified chips lets brands
and creators find reach + engagement, not just follower tallies.

Fast planning: AttachinFlow collapses multisite planning into one
search + one checkout.

Fair & trustworthy: Relevance and availability rule; promotions are
clearly labeled and capped; Safe Mode protects brand and users.

§4.7 --- Checkout & Linked Booking Group

Goal: Make paying predictable, transparent, and safe for both Talent and
Studio bookings---whether purchased alone or together. Treat Talent and
Studio as separate bookings with independent policies & payouts, but
present a single, simple checkout and one receipt when bought together
via an LBG. Minimize dropoff with clear fees, policy previews, and fast
payment flows (Card, ACH).

A\) Entry Points & Routes

From People profile (Packages): Book / Request to Book →
/checkout/talent/{tempId}

From Studio page: Instant Book / Request → /checkout/studio/{tempId}

From Brief/Compare: Award → /checkout/talent/{tempId} (prefilled)

AttachinFlow (talent checkout): adds a Studio →
/checkout/group/{groupId}

Linked Group summary (always when 2 bookings present):
/checkout/group/{groupId}

B\) Checkout Structure (single vs group)

Singlebooking Checkout (Talent or Studio)

Details (date/time/duration, package or hourly calc)

Docs (Smart Docs pack)

Payment (card/ACH)

Confirm

Linked Booking Group (Talent + Studio)

Group header with two panels: Talent \| Studio (expand/collapse)

Steps: Review → Docs → Payment → Confirm

Policies & totals displayed per booking, with a group total at bottom.

Atomicity: The LBG confirms only if both bookings succeed
(payments/holds). If one fails, the user sees options to retry, edit, or
remove the failing item.

C\) Details Step

Talent panel

Package chosen, addons, price; travel fee calc (zone or permile beyond
included radius), schedule, location (approx).

Instant Book chip if applicable; otherwise "Request to Book" label with
expected response window.

Studio panel

Date/time & min hours check; hourly calc + cleaning fee (if set);
deposit hold badge with amount; rules summary.

Conflicts & validation

Live revalidation of availability for both panels before continuing.

If collision or minhours violation, inline error + suggested
alternatives (nearby time slots, similar studios).

Group time sync enforced: studio duration must cover talent time (+
configured buffer).

D\) Smart Docs Step (esign before pay)

Autoassembled packs (prefilled from booking context):

Talent: SOW, License, Model Release (if needed), Cancellation policy
summary.

Studio: Property/Space Release, House Rules, Safety Addendum
(autoincluded if hazards toggled), Studio cancellation terms.

Esign required to proceed (oneclick signer sheet per doc; audit trail
stored).

Amendments: if details change later (reschedule/adjustments), amended
docs generate automatically and require reack.

Address privacy: Studio's exact address unlocks after confirmation;
shown in thread + ics attachments.

E\) Payment Step

Methods

Card (3DS/SCA when required)

ACH (Plaidlike link) → buyer fee reduced to 3% (min \$3) when enabled;
may have delayed confirmation.

Apple Pay / Google Pay (Phase 2) where supported.

What's charged

Talent: full booking subtotal into escrow (per §1.3).

Studio: full studio subtotal into escrow + deposit hold authorization
(not charged) per listing configuration.

Buyer service fee per booking (5% card / 3% ACH when enabled).

Taxes (if applicable) itemized per booking.

Atomic capture for LBG

Attempt charges/holds in a safe order (e.g., Talent escrow → Studio
escrow → Studio deposit hold).

If any step fails → no booking confirms; guide user to retry or remove
problem item.

Promos & discounts

City promos autoapply (e.g., founding city 0% buyer fee).

Provider fee discounts (IB --1%, Trusted Pro --0.5%) affect provider
payout, not buyer total; shown as "Provider earns more with Instant
Book" tooltip.

Fee transparency

Inline "What do platform fees cover?" tooltip: escrow, contracts,
support, processing.

F\) Confirm Step

Success page shows two booking tiles (Talent • Studio) with: status,
dates, "Open thread," "Add to calendar," "View Docs," "Share itinerary."

Deposit hold line (Studio): clearly states authorization amount &
automatic release window (e.g., 48h postcheckout if no claim).

Trusted contact prompt (optional safety feature): share generalarea
location & times during the session.

Next actions:

Buyer: "Message" / "Request reschedule" / "Add notes for shoot"

Seller/Host: "Review details" / "Send prep notes" / "Share access code"
(studio)

G\) Pricing & Calculations (display rules)

Per booking (panel & receipt lines):

Subtotal (Talent: package + addons + travel; Studio: hours×rate +
cleaning + approved addons)

Buyer fee (5% card / 3% ACH when enabled; min \$3; nonrefundable on
buyer cancels per policy)

Estimated taxes (if applicable)

Deposit hold (Studio only; authorization)

Total charged now (escrow amounts)

Group total shown at bottom in LBG; collapsible breakdown.

H\) Edits & Reschedules (pre/postconfirmation)

Before confirmation

Edit time, add/remove addons; LBG validates both bookings.

Changing Talent time proposes Studio shift (and viceversa); if not
possible, show split option or alternatives.

After confirmation (flows in thread, per §1.3 addendum)

Propose reschedule to both bookings in LBG; new times quoted &
reauthorized if totals change.

Split LBG if only one party can accommodate change (buyer chooses);
refunds per respective matrices.

Change orders (Talent) & duration changes (Studio) recalc totals;
amended docs issued.

I\) Cancellations & Refund Preview

Inline policy previews on each panel with "Learn more" to KB.

Cancellation modal shows computed outcomes per booking (e.g., "Talent:
50% refund • Studio: 0% refund") and a group summary.

Host/Sellerfault cancels: autorefunds buyer fee for that booking;
goodwill credits as configured (§3.9).

J\) Receipts & Calendar

Unified receipt with two sections (Talent • Studio), fees, taxes, and
deposit authorization line (Studio).

ICS invites per booking; Linked Group itinerary (combined) downloadable.

Tax docs stored per booking (not shown at checkout).

K\) Error Handling & Edge Cases

Payment declined / 3DS fail: stay on Payment step; show reason; allow
method switch.

Deposit hold fail (Studio): surface amount & bank advice; offer to
remove Studio or retry.

Doublebooking race: if availability disappears between Details and Pay,
show conflict modal with alternatives.

Early exit policy note (Studio): no prorata refunds unless host agrees;
checkout governs overtime only.

No rideshare integration at v1: travel is seller configurable; buyers
may arrange transport independently.

L\) Accessibility, Performance & Privacy

Accessibility: logical heading order; labeled inputs; ARIA for steppers
and docs list; keyboardable signature.

Performance: TTI \< 2.5s; defer SDKs (ACH/OAuth/3DS) until opened;
skeletons for panels; cache price calcs clientside.

Privacy: exact studio address hidden until confirm; only general area
shown prior; emails/push never contain 18+ previews.

M\) Telemetry

checkout.open (type=talent\|studio\|group)

checkout.validate.ok/fail (reason=availability\|min_hours\|conflict)

docs.sign (doc type) • docs.amend.issued/accepted

payment.method.select (card\|ach) • payment.attempt.success/fail
(reason)

deposit.authorize.success/fail (amount)

checkout.confirm.success (single\|group)

cancel.preview.open • cancel.submit (outcome per booking)

reschedule.propose/accept (group=Y/N)

promo.apply (city_promo\|code)

fee.tooltip.view (engagement proxy)

N\) Acceptance Criteria (mark 4.7 FINAL)

Single & group checkouts implemented with steppers, perbooking panels,
and a group total for LBG.

Smart Docs packs (Talent: SOW/License/Release; Studio: Property/Space
Release + House Rules + Safety Addendum) are esigned before payment;
amended docs reissued on changes.

Payment supports Card and ACH (ACH reduces buyer fee to 3% when
enabled); handles 3DS; logs outcomes.

Escrow collected per booking; Studio deposit hold authorized (not GMV).

Atomic LBG: both bookings must succeed or none confirm; failure guidance
provided.

Policies & refunds previewed per booking; cancellation modal computes
outcomes; receipts show split lines and deposit authorization.

Reschedule & change order flows are LBGaware (sync or split), with
reauth when totals change.

Travel fees (Talent) calculated from role settings (zones/mi beyond
included radius).

Accessibility, performance, privacy baselines met; telemetry events
fire.

O\) Why this works

Confidence to commit: Contracts signed before money moves; fees and
policies are crystalclear.

Simple for buyers, correct for finance: One checkout & receipt---even
for two bookings---while ledgers stay separate.

Fewer support tickets: Evidencefirst docs, deposit holds, and policy
previews reduce disputes.

Launchready: Card + ACH, IB + Request, and AttachinFlow cover the common
paths without building a full billing platform.

§4.8 --- Delivery Room & Acceptance

Goal: Provide a storagesane, evidencefirst workspace for handing off
creative work, managing proofs → selects → finals, verifying promo/UGC
deliverables, and closing out bookings with clear acceptance timers that
trigger payouts and reduce disputes.

A\) Routes & Ownership

Buyer view: /booking/{id}/delivery (read/approve/request revisions).

Seller view: /booking/{id}/delivery (author/publish/revise).

Studio bookings: show readonly timeline (checkin/out, docs); no Delivery
Room (studios don't deliver files).

Linked Booking Group: each booking has its own Delivery Room; LBG
summary links to each.

B\) Concepts & Stages

Manifest --- authoritative list of deliverables (filenames/links +
checksums, size, type, version).

Proofs --- lowres watermarked images / lowbitrate proxies for video; no
originals on platform.

Selects --- buyer picks which proofs should be finalized (if package
includes selection).

Finals --- fullspec outputs referenced via external links
(Drive/Dropbox/OneDrive/S3) + optional onplatform proxy; license applies
on acceptance.

UGC/Promo --- a verified post on IG/YT/TT/X with link and API check +
required minlive window.

Storagesane principle: We host previews/proxies only; originals stay at
the source. We capture a manifest and verify integrity (hash), so
disputes can be adjudicated without hosting 100GB+ assets.

C\) Typical Workflow

Prepare & Upload Proofs (seller)

Create a Delivery batch → add Proofs (images/videos) with auto
watermark/proxy.

Add External Links (optional) for previewing higher quality; platform
immediately stores manifest metadata (name, ext, size, checksum,
provider, URL).

Autochecks (see §F) run and annotate items.

Buyer Reviews Proofs

Grid/lightbox with zoom; peritem comments (and timecode comments for
video).

Buyer Selects up to the package count (e.g., 12 edits).

If package includes no selection step (e.g., "deliver all 20"), skip to
Finals.

Publish Finals (seller)

For each selected item (or the whole set), upload Final proxies and
attach External Links to originals.

Mark items Final; system locks proof download (if enabled) and exposes
Final download links.

Add License terms chip (pulled from package preset) and Usage window if
applicable.

Acceptance Window starts

Default 7 days (configurable per package: 3/7/14 days).

Buyer can Accept all or specific items, or Request revision (counts
toward package revision rounds).

Autoaccept triggers when the window expires with no action.

UGC/Promo: acceptance occurs when post verifies (API or link) and
remains live for the minlive window (e.g., 72h) --- see §E.

Closeout

On Acceptance/Autoaccept, talent booking moves to Completed; payout
queues per §1.3/§3.1.

Leave a review prompt for both sides.

D\) Roles & Deliverable Types (what's supported v1)

Photographer / Videographer: proofs → selects (optional) → finals;
peritem comments, timecoded notes; revision rounds per package.

Model (as seller): usually no file delivery; deliverables are
Time/Service + signed Model Release (already in Smart Docs). Optional:
selfie IDmatch (phase 2).

UGC Creator / FanSubscription Creator (promo work): Post verification
deliverables:

Link to post + screenshot on publish; platform fetches post ID,
timestamp, initial metrics (where APIs allow).

System tracks minlive (e.g., 72h) + post window (e.g., 7 days).

Acceptance after minlive + verification (see §E).

Studio: no deliverables; checkin/out + docs + deposit flows instead.

E\) UGC/Promo Verification (Creators & FanSub Creators)

At delivery: seller submits link to the post (IG/YT/TT/X) + optional
screenshot.

Verification check (hourly during window):

Confirms post exists, is public, matches handle, and the timestamp ≥
booking delivery time.

Logs engagement metrics snapshot (ER proxy) where APIs permit (or
displays "unverified metrics" for linkonly).

Minlive enforcement: track continuous visibility for N hours (package
default 72h; configurable per deliverable).

Acceptance rule: autoaccept on passing verification + minlive, or manual
accept earlier by buyer.

Edge cases: post removed/hidden before minlive → seller can repost once
without restarting the entire acceptance window; noncompliance → buyer
may open refund request (policy per §3.9).

Safe Mode note: We neither fetch nor display 18+ media; SFW thumbnails
only; for FanSub Creators we record confirmation and metrics sans
explicit previews.

F\) AutoChecks & Evidence (objective validation)

On upload or link attach:

Technical:

Images: resolution (≥ target px), color space (sRGB/Adobe RGB), aspect
ratio, file type, filesize, EXIF presence.

Video: container/codec (MP4/H.264 or ProRes proxy), resolution, fps,
audio channels, duration.

Integrity: virus scan; checksum recorded (SHA256) for proofs/finals (and
for external manifests when possible).

Policy guards: NSFW detection warning (so sellers avoid borderline
public previews); SafeMode validation on previews.

Link checks: provider type (Drive/Dropbox/OneDrive/S3), reachability,
headers (size/type), and expiry status.

Evidence pack: autocollects manifest, checks, and timestamps; used in
disputes.

G\) Revisions & Comments

Revision rounds: default 1 round (configurable per package); seller can
grant extras inthread.

Peritem comments (images); timecoded comments (video); resolve state for
each comment.

Change requests must be actionable (UI enforces structured notes: crop,
color, retouch notes, timecode ranges).

Timers: buyer must submit revision request within the acceptance window;
seller SLA per package (e.g., 3 business days).

H\) Downloads & Watermarks

Proofs: watermarked, previewonly (download toggle off by default).

Finals: download links visible immediately on publish, or after
acceptance (package option).

External originals: always via provider's storage
(Drive/Dropbox/OneDrive/S3/S3 presigned); we never host originals.

Retention: onplatform proxies kept 90 days; manifests retained 12--24
months; banner clarifies "Not a backup service."

I\) Acceptance, Autoaccept & Payout Triggers

Acceptance window: default 7 days (3/7/14 options).

Manual Accept: buyer can accept itemlevel or whole batch; license
certificate issues instantly.

Autoaccept: when timer ends without open revision; licenses issue
automatically; payout queues.

Partial acceptance: allowed; payout apportions across accepted items if
package contracted peritem pricing; otherwise paid on batch acceptance.

UGC/Promo: acceptance on verify + minlive; payout scheduled afterwards.

Early Payout (peruse): eligible sellers (Rep ≥ 85) can accelerate
postacceptance.

J\) Disputes & NonDelivery

Missing deliverables (seller uploaded fewer than contracted): buyer
opens Refund Request; system compares contracted vs manifest; partial
refunds computed.

Quality disputes (offspec): rely on Autochecks + SOW to determine
deviation; may provide partial refund or revision credit.

Expired external links: seller must refresh within 48h of buyer notice;
timers pause during refresh grace; repeated expiry → reputation hit.

Escalation to Neutral Review (per §3.9): evidence pack includes
manifest, checks, comments, timestamps, link status, and SOW terms.

Studios: route to studio deposit/adjustment flows (no file disputes).

K\) Security, Privacy & Policy

Virus scanning on all uploads; block executables; safe MIME validation.

EXIF privacy: warn on personal EXIF; provide "strip on proxy" option.

DMCA & IP: report flow; lock downloads when claim is open; notify both
parties.

Safe Mode: only SFW previews visible publicly; buyer & seller see full
content subject to policy; FanSub flows avoid explicit previews.

L\) UI Details (components & states)

ManifestList with status chips: Proof • Final • Needs action • Error •
Link expired.

AutoCheckStatus: green/yellow/red with tooltips (e.g., "Video exceeds
4GB proxy limit; original link captured").

Comment sidebar (per item) with timecodes & resolve checkboxes.

Timer banner: shows Acceptance ends in Xd Xh; pauses if revision round
is open.

License chip on each Final; View License opens certificate modal (terms,
project, booking ID).

UGC tracker: "Verifying post..." → "Live ✓ (48/72h remaining)" →
"Verified ✓".

M\) Notifications & Emails

Seller: "Buyer selected X proofs" • "Revision requested on N items" •
"Acceptance complete"

Buyer: "Finals ready" • "Acceptance ends in 24h" • "UGC post failed
verification (reason)"

Both: "Autoaccept in 3h" • "Links expired---action required"

Emails respect Safe Mode (no explicit previews).

N\) Metrics

Time to first delivery, time to acceptance, % autoaccept, revision rate,
firstpass acceptance rate, link failure rate, nondelivery incidents,
refund rate, UGC verification pass rate, minlive compliance rate.

Feed Reputation inputs: ontime delivery, revision compliance,
nondelivery, link reliability.

O\) Telemetry (events)

delivery.batch.create/publish • delivery.item.add/remove •
delivery.link.attach/refresh/expire

autocheck.pass/warn/fail (reason) • virus.block

proofs.view • selects.add/remove • finals.publish

ugc.verify.start/pass/fail • ugc.min_live.progress

refund_request.open/resolve (outcome)

license.certificate.view/download

P\) Acceptance Criteria (mark 4.8 FINAL)

Delivery Room supports Proofs → Selects (optional) → Finals with peritem
comments and timecoded notes for video.

External link manifest captured (name, size, type, checksum where
available, provider, URL); no original hosting; proxies/previews only.

Autochecks run on upload/link; results shown per item; virus scan
enforced.

Acceptance window (3/7/14 days) with Autoaccept; partial acceptance
supported; payout triggers wired.

UGC/Promo verification: link ingest, API checks when available, minlive
tracking, acceptance on verify+minlive.

Revisions: at least 1 round configurable; structured change requests;
timers pause during active revision.

Downloads & watermarks: proofs watermarked; finals downloadable per
package rule; retention & "not a backup" banner visible.

Disputes: nondelivery/quality/linkexpiry flows with evidence packs;
timers & outcomes integrate with §3.9.

Safe Mode & policy: SFW previews only; FanSub Creator flows avoid
explicit media.

Telemetry & metrics instrumented as listed.

Q\) Why this works

Reduces disputes: Objective manifests, autochecks, and acceptance timers
create shared reality.

Scales cheaply: Proxies + external links avoid massive storage costs
while preserving evidence.

Fits every role: Photographers/video get proofs→finals; creators get
verified posts; studios don't carry file baggage.

Clear payout triggers: Acceptance (or verified minlive) drives
completion; LBG clarity remains intact.

§4.9 --- Messaging & Threads --- FINAL

Goal: Provide a fast, safe, and actioncentric inbox where buyers,
talent, and studio hosts coordinate work. Threads must: (1) reduce
backandforth via Quick Actions (quote, reschedule, change order,
refunds), (2) keep evidence attached (docs, delivery, checkin/out), and
(3) respect our fairuse DM credits, Safe Mode, and offplatform payment
guardrails.

A\) Principles

Do work in the thread --- Quotes, schedule changes, docs, delivery,
adjustments, refunds are all firstclass actions.

Context everywhere --- Each thread shows role/space, booking status, and
key policy snippets.

Evidence over opinion --- Autoattach Smart Docs, Delivery manifests,
checkin/out, and price math.

Safe by default --- Hide personal contact info; scan attachments;
offplatform payment attempts are discouraged and throttled.

Low friction --- Replies are free; new conversation credits are the only
scarce resource (per §3.2).

LBGaware --- When Talent + Studio are booked together, keep threads
separate but coordinated, with Group Broadcast when needed.

B\) Thread Types & Routing

Inquiry thread (prebooking) --- starts from profile/search/brief invite.
Uses DM credit on the first outbound message only; replies are free.

Booking thread (Talent) --- created on acceptance/IB; status chips:
Booked → In progress → Delivered → Completed; shows escrow status.

Booking thread (Studio) --- created on acceptance/IB; shows access
details (masked until esign), deposit hold state, checkin/out status.

RFP thread --- buyer broadcast → provider reply; converts to
Inquiry/Booking on award.

LBG umbrella --- not a chat; a summary bar linking to the two booking
threads; supports Group Broadcast (see §I).

Routes: /messages (list) • /messages/{threadId} (detail) •
/messages?group={groupId} (shows both group threads with Broadcast
control)

C\) Layout (Thread Detail)

Header bar

Counterpart avatar & name • Role/Studio chip • City • Booking status
chip • Rep ring (0--100) mini • "View booking" • "View docs"

Rightside actions: Quick Quote / Change Order / Propose Reschedule /
Issue Refund / Get help (contextual, role/space aware)

Left (or main) pane

Message list (bubbles with timestamps, read receipts, link previews,
inline image/video previews with SafeMode filtering)

Pinned message (e.g., access code) shown atop until unpinned

Right (or drawer) pane

Summary card (dates, times, location neighborhood, price lines)

Docs (SOW, License, Release; Studio: Property/Space Release, House
Rules)

Delivery status (if talent thread)

Checkin/out (if studio thread)

Policies mini cards (cancel/refund window)

Group chip if part of LBG (tap to switch thread or use Broadcast)

D\) Composer & Message Types

Text (rich formatting minimal: bold, list, link)

Attachments: images, short clips (previewed), PDFs; virusscanned and
SafeMode filtered in public previews

Snippets/Templates: canned replies by role; perrole variables (price,
slots, packages)

Scheduling poll (propose 2--5 times)

Quick Quote (inline price proposal from package + addons → turns into a
booking when accepted)

Location picker (neighborhood only; exact studio address never sent
until docs signed)

Voice notes (Phase 2; text transcript required if enabled)

Emoji/ack (👍 etc.) to reduce noise

Credit logic:

Starting a new thread consumes 1 credit (per §3.2).

Replies, booking threads, and RFP replies do not consume credits.

If messages breach spam checks, sending slows or blocks (see §G).

E\) Pipeline, Automation & Reminders

Pipeline chips (auto): New • Needs Info • Quoted • Awarded • Booked •
Delivered • Completed

Autonudges (1/day max/thread) when: quote unanswered 48h, buyer hasn't
proposed times, docs unsigned, delivery unreviewed.

Snooze a thread (until date/time or after event).

Remind me later on action items (e.g., "Follow up on Tuesday").

F\) Quick Actions (contextual, policyaware)

Quick Quote (Inquiry → Booking)

Pick a package, adjust addons, travel, discounts; preview fee/takehome;
send quote.

Buyer taps Accept & Pay → goes to Talent checkout (or LBG if studio
already attached).

Propose Reschedule (Booking)

Propose new date/time (Talent or Studio); if LBG, system proposes
synchronized change to both bookings.

If only one can move, buyer picks: Split group or Change both later.

Change Order (Talent)

Add hours, addons, license tier changes; requote and reauthorize;
amended Smart Docs issued.

Issue Refund / Discount (Talent)

Partial refund or discount (policyaware); provider fee recalculates;
receipts reissued.

Studio: Share Access / Update Code

Access code (masked until both docs signed) • Parking/entry notes •
Backup contact.

Audit log for code reveals/updates.

Studio: PostBooking Adjustment

Overtime/crew overage/violation; attach photos/logs; opens adjustment
claim (per §3.9 timers).

Delivery: Request Acceptance / Request Revision

Inline buttons appear when the stage is appropriate.

Support: Get help

Opens contextual selfserve (refund, access issue, adjustment/dispute),
attaching evidence from the thread.

All actions produce system messages with links to receipts, docs, or
delivery items.

G\) Safety, Privacy & Abuse Controls

Autoredact obvious phone/email/payment handles prebooking; after
confirmation, allow a masked relay number/email (Phase 2) or keep inapp
only at v1.

Offplatform payment detection → inline reminder + link to Protection
benefits; repeat attempts throttle new thread creation.

Harassment & slur filter → soft block + "Report" affordance; P0 safety
escalations surface hotline.

Attachment guards → virus scan, MIME/type check, SafeMode preview
compliance; large files rejected with Delivery guidance.

Block/Mute other party; Report with categories (misrepresentation,
harassment, payment circumvention, explicit content).

Privacy: toggle Read receipts ON/OFF per user (default ON); Last seen
off by default.

H\) Inbox (List) & Search

Unified inbox with folders: All, Action needed, Booked, Archived.

Sort: Recent activity (default) • Unread first • By pipeline stage.

Filters: Role (if multirole), Studio (if host), City, Has booking, Has
docs pending, Has delivery pending.

Search within inbox: counterpart name, project title, booking ID.

Archive & Pin threads; archive autoreopens on new activity.

I\) LBGAware Collaboration

Group bar on talent or studio booking thread shows the partner booking
card with status and a "Broadcast to both" toggle.

Broadcast sends a message to both threads with a banner "Sent to both
bookings"; replies arrive in respective threads (kept separate for
policy/payout reasons).

Reschedules launched from either thread attempt to update both bookings;
system explains outcomes if only one can move.

Docs & delivery remain per booking; crosslinks appear in the group bar.

J\) Timezones, Localization & Calendars

All timestamps show local time for each user; hover reveals UTC and
other party's local time.

Date/time proposals include both parties' local times in the message
bubble.

ICS attachments created on booking and on accepted reschedules.

K\) Reliability & Performance

Optimistic send with retry; duplicate protection (idempotent keys).

Typing and read indicators; fall back gracefully on poor networks.

Attachment uploads show progress; resume on reconnect.

Message retention: durable; no hard expiry.

L\) Telemetry

inbox.view • thread.open • message.send
(type=text\|image\|pdf\|quote\|poll\|action) • message.read

quick_quote.open/send/accepted • reschedule.propose/accept/decline •
change_order.open/confirm

refund.issue • studio.access.share/update • adjustment.open/resolve

delivery.request_accept • delivery.request_revision

broadcast.send (group) • offplatform.detect • report.submit

dm_credit.consume/block • nudge.auto.sent

M\) Acceptance Criteria (mark 4.9 FINAL)

Thread types implemented (Inquiry, Booking---Talent/Studio, RFP) with
role/space context and status chips.

Composer supports text, attachments, templates, scheduling polls, Quick
Quote; SafeMode filtering for previews.

Quick Actions live and policyaware: Quick Quote, Propose Reschedule,
Change Order, Issue Refund/Discount, Studio Access, PostBooking
Adjustment.

LBGaware features: group bar, Broadcast, synchronized reschedules with
split option.

Read receipts, typing, pin, archive, inbox filters/search delivered; DM
credit spend only on first outbound of new threads.

Safety: offplatform detection, harassment filter, virus scan,
block/mute/report; personal contact hidden prebooking; access codes
masked until esign.

Evidence autoattached: docs, delivery links, checkin/out, receipts;
system messages for every action.

Time zone clarity in proposals and timestamps; ICS updated on
reschedule.

Performance: optimistic sends, retry, upload progress; telemetry fires
as listed.

N\) Why this works

Fewer support touches: The thread is a control panel---quotes,
reschedules, refunds, and adjustments live where the conversation
happens.

Safer & cleaner: Guardrails reduce fraud and harassment without blocking
legit coordination.

LBG clarity without confusion: Keep bookings separate for policy/payout,
yet coordinate via Group Broadcast and synchronized changes.

Frictionlight: Replies are free; credits only gate outbound cold
outreach, which protects buyers and keeps the inbox healthy.

§4.10 --- Reviews & Reputation UX

Goal: Make feedback trustworthy, fair, and hard to game---so buyers can
choose confidently and providers/hosts know what to improve. Keep
reviews rolescoped for People and spacescoped for Studios. Use a
transparent 0--100 Reputation Score that's explainable, timeweighted,
and tied to real outcomes (ontime delivery, noshow rate, safety).
Respect Safe Mode, privacy, and legal boundaries.

A\) Principles

Only from real jobs: Public star/text reviews come only from completed,
onplatform bookings (verified by escrow + acceptance).

Doubleblind & timeboxed: Neither side sees the other's review until both
submit or the window closes.

Role/space scoped: Reviews and reputation never mix across roles;
studios have their own reputation.

Evidence beats rhetoric: Where relevant, the UI shows objective signals
(checkin/out, delivery timestamps, UGC minlive pass).

Safety first: Provide a private safety feedback channel separate from
public reviews; enforce antiharassment and antidoxxing rules.

Explain the math: The Reputation Score always has a "Why this score?"
breakdown and decay timeline.

B\) Triggers & Windows

Trigger to review:

Talent bookings: on Acceptance or Autoaccept in Delivery Room.

Studios: at checkout complete (after checkout time passes and no open
access issue).

Window: 14 days from trigger for both parties.

Doubleblind: Reviews publish when both are submitted or at day 14; if
only one submits, both publish at day 14.

Reminders: Day 3, Day 10 nudges; Day13 last call (inapp + email).

Who can review: The buyer and the counterparty (provider or host). No
thirdparty public reviews.

Canceled jobs:

Provider/hostfault cancel: no star review; system records a reliability
penalty visible in the Rep breakdown.

Buyerfault cancel: same (penalty on buyer account; not public).

Noshow: no star review; a Noshow marker feeds reputation (decays).

C\) Review Composer (roleaware)

Common structure

Stars (1--5)

Short tags (2--3 chips)

Optional text (min 30 chars for 1--2★; 4--5★ can be empty)

Photo evidence (SFW only; optional; studios allow space photos; talent
allows BTS SFW)

Private safety feedback (structured, never public; see §H)

Rolespecific tags

Model/Creator: Professional • Punctual • Communication •
Posing/Direction • Boundaries respected • Would book again

Photographer: Direction • Professional • Communication • Turnaround met
• Quality of edits • Clear brief

Videographer: Professional • Audio quality • Color grade • Timely
delivery • Communication

UGC/FanSub Creator: Followed brief • Post verified • Met minlive •
Onbrand • Clear disclosure

Studio (space): Accurate listing • Easy access • Cleanliness • Noise
control • Natural light • Amenities as described

Guardrails

Disallow personal info (emails/phones), hate speech, harassment; inline
warnings with policy links.

Safe Mode ensures no explicit images can be attached.

D\) Display & Surfacing

On profiles (People)

Star average + count (shows only after ≥ 3 verified reviews)

Reputation Ring (0--100) with "Why this score?" → breakdown and recent
trend sparkline

Latest reviews (3--5), with Verified booking label; studio reviews never
appear here

Community references in a separate section (low weight, ownerapproved)

On Studio pages

Star average + count (threshold ≥ 3)

Studio Reputation Ring (spacescoped) with breakdown (reliability
includes deposit claim behavior)

Photo reviews encouraged (SFW), especially of space and amenities

In Search

Rep ring chip on cards; hover/tooltip with score reason

Filters: Min Reputation (0--100) and Min Stars (1--5)

Sort: Top Reputation, Rating, and Recent

E\) Reputation Score (0--100) --- computation (v1)

Weights (roleaware; spaceaware for studios)

Reviews & volume --- 40% (Bayesiansmoothed star mean; more weight with
more reviews; community references capped)

Reliability --- 25% (ontime completion, noshow rate, cancel fault,
dispute loss rate; deposit abuse for studios)

Responsiveness --- 10% (median first response time; response
consistency)

Verifications --- 15% (ID, Trusted Pro, Socialverified, Verified Studio)

Recent performance --- 10% (last 90 days weighted 2×)

Penalties & decay

Late cancellations/noshows/dispute losses apply sharp penalties that
decay over 60--120 days.

Smallsample protection: Bayesian prior (city/role baseline) prevents
"100 after 1 review."

Caps: Any single factor can affect at most ±12 points per month
(prevents sudden swings).

New accounts: show "New --- building reputation" until 3 verified
reviews or 10 completed bookings.

Transparency

"Why this score?" panel shows 5 bars and examples ("2 late cancellations
in last 90 days (--6)").

"How to improve" checklist (e.g., Enable Instant Book; verify ID; reply
faster; meet delivery SLA).

F\) Antigaming & Moderation

Ring detection: repeated mutual 5★ bursts across a tight user cluster
(IP/device/time overlap) → flag; reduce weight; investigate.

Incentivized reviews: explicit quidproquo offers ("5★ for discount") are
prohibited; detection via text patterns + reports.

Review gating: Providers/hosts cannot prompt reviews with incentives
inthread; system handles prompts neutrally.

One owner response per review; edits allowed for 15 minutes after
posting, then locked (typos only).

Flagging: "Report review" (harassment, personal info, hate, explicit
content, irrelevant, privacy breach).

Outofscope: We don't remove reviews for mere opinion or star rating;
removal is for policy violations only.

Anonymity options: Buyers can publish under brand/team name; personal
names are hidden by default.

G\) LBG (Linked Booking Group) behavior

One postbooking flow invites the buyer to review both bookings (Talent &
Studio) in a single step; each publishes to its own page.

Reviews remain independent; a studio's issues don't lower a
photographer's rating (and vice versa).

If one booking is canceled by fault, the other may still be reviewable
per its own rules.

H\) Safety Feedback (private, nonpublic)

Structured form in the review flow: boundary violations, harassment,
unsafe space, undisclosed cameras, access issues.

Feeds Safety Console with the booking context, checkin/out, docs, and
message snippets.

Not public; may trigger a strike, IB suppression, or verification
recheck; submitter receives outcome summary when resolved.

I\) Prompting & Emails (biasfree)

Neutral subject lines and copy ("Share feedback about your experience").

No starnudging language; no images that could bias; SFW only.

Onetap stars deeplink on mobile; text field optional except for 1--2★
(reason required).

Followup once if unreviewed; no further nags after day 14.

J\) Metrics & Health Targets

Review completion rate ≥ 55% (either side)

Doubleblind submissions ≥ 35% (both sides submitted before day 14)

1--2★ share within expected band (watch for chilling effects)

Disputeadjusted satisfaction (4★+ after successful support outcome)

Flag rate \< 2% of reviews; removal rate \< 0.4% (policy violations
only)

Rep score stability (stdev \< 6 points over 30 days for steady accounts)

Correlation: Rep vs conversion uplift (target positive, diminishing
returns past \~85)

K\) Telemetry

review.request.sent/open • review.submit (stars, role\|studio) •
review.publish

review.flag (reason) • review.owner_response.submit

rep.why.open • rep.improve.view/action

L\) Acceptance Criteria (mark 4.10 FINAL)

Doubleblind reviews with a 14day window; publish when both submit or on
expiry.

Rolescoped reviews & reputation for People; spacescoped for Studios;
never mixed.

Composer includes stars, tags, optional text, SFW photos, and private
safety feedback.

Display: profiles/pages show star average (≥3 reviews), latest reviews,
Reputation Ring with transparent breakdown.

Reputation Score computed with weights (40/25/10/15/10), Bayesian
smoothing, penalties with decay, caps on monthtomonth swing, and "New"
state until minimum data.

Search integrates Rep ring chips, filters (Min Rep/Min Stars), and sort
options.

Antigaming rules enforced: ring detection, no incentives, policybased
removals only; owner reply limits.

LBG review bundle flow implemented; each review publishes to its own
entity.

Safe Mode respected: no explicit media in reviews; emails/push SFW.

Telemetry & KPIs instrumented as listed.

M\) Why this works

Trustworthy by design: Only verified bookings yield public reviews; the
rest factor into reliability quietly.

Explainable, not mysterious: The 0--100 score with a clear "why" builds
confidence and guides improvement.

Hard to game, easy to use: Doubleblind timing, smallsample smoothing,
and ring detection keep ratings honest; the UI stays friendly.

Aligns with search & conversions: Strong reputation helps sort ties
without letting paid boosts hijack results.

§4.11 --- Support, Refunds & Disputes UX

Goal: Resolve issues quickly, predictably, and fairly with minimal human
touch. Keep everything policyaware, evidencefirst, LBGaware (Talent +
Studio), and feeaccurate (per §3.1). Make outcomes clear before users
commit to a request, and autoassemble evidence (docs, checkin/out,
delivery manifests, deposit settings) to reduce friction and fraud.

A\) Principles

Do it where the work lives: All flows start in the booking thread via
Inthread ▸ Get help; no context loss.

Outcome clarity upfront: Show a refund/charge preview based on policy
matrix and timestamps before submission.

Evidence beats rhetoric: Autoattach Smart Docs, Delivery manifests,
checkin/out, calendar logs, studio access logs, and payment lines.

Separate ledgers: Talent and Studio bookings are independent; LBG shows
a single summary with perbooking outcomes.

Timers & SLAs: Access issues are P1; standard disputes follow strict
windows (24h/48h/5day).

Chargebackready: Every case builds a representment pack by default.

SFW & privacy: No explicit media; exact studio address hidden except to
parties; Safe Mode respected in notifications.

B\) Entry Points & Routes

Thread shortcut: Inthread ▸ Get help (contextual forms)

Profile menu: Support Center /support → lists bookings + cases

Booking detail: Open a case button

Admin: Support Console /admin/support (agentonly)

C\) Case Types (policyaware, minimal)

Talent bookings

Refund request -- cancellation (buyerinitiated; applies §3.9 talent
matrix)

Nondelivery / missing items (compare SOW vs manifest)

Offspec quality (autochecks vs SOW; may route to revision first)

Noshow / late arrival (uses checkin/out evidence)

Payment correction (duplicate charge, tax error)

Studio bookings

Access issue (live) → P1 (badge); resolves or refunds per §3.9 addendum

Damage claim (hostinitiated; deposit hold)

Postbooking adjustment (overtime, crew overage, rule violation)

Amenity misrepresentation (partial refund if material)

Payment correction

Linked Booking Group (LBG)

Group cancel/split (compute separate outcomes; show one summary)

Group reschedule (sync both bookings or split)

Mixed dispute (e.g., Talent deliverables issue + Studio OK)

D\) SelfServe Triage Wizard (all flows)

Step 1 --- Identify issue

Contextaware options (e.g., "Access code not working" on Studio;
"Delivered fewer images than contracted" on Talent).

Step 2 --- Policy preview

Show matrix snippet (e.g., "\>7d=100%, 7--48h=50%, \<48h=0%"), countdown
timers, and estimated outcomes (refund lines per booking, buyer fee
policy, deposit note).

If outcome is clearly \$0, offer "Contact seller/host" instead of
filing.

Step 3 --- Evidence (auto + user)

Autoattached: checkin/out (Studio), SOW/License/House Rules, Delivery
manifest, Autochecks, messages timeline, price lines, deposit
configuration, access logs (if integrated).

User prompts: upload photos/video (SFW), describe discrepancy; link to
UGC post when relevant.

Step 4 --- Review & submit

Show refund/charge preview with taxes/fees; LBG outcome split if group;
submit → case created.

Confirmation

Thread posts a system message summarizing the case; both parties get
actions (Respond / Add evidence).

E\) Evidence & Calculations (what the engine uses)

Talent: SOW (deliverables count/spec), Delivery manifest
(filenames/checksums), Autochecks (resolution, codecs), acceptance
timestamps, revision rounds used, messages referencing scope.

Studio: checkin/out geofence pass/fail, House Rules signatures, access
logs, pre/post photos, schedule vs booked, crew count note, hazard
toggles & Safety Addendum.

Financials: escrow amounts, provider fee, buyer fee, tax lines, deposit
authorization, promotions/discounts.

Outcome logic: applies matrices from §3.9; refund buyer fee only on
provider/hostfault or safety exceptions; deposit captures no platform
fee (per §3.1 addendum).

F\) Case Lifecycle & States

Open (awaiting counterparty) --- autodeadline set (48h respond).

Evidence needed --- requester must add missing items (48h).

Proposed resolution --- party has 48h to accept/decline.

Neutral Review --- agent evaluates evidence; target decision ≤ 5
business days.

Resolved --- refund/charge issued; receipts & amended docs generated.

Closed --- telemetry logged; affects Reputation and future eligibility
(IB/boosts).

Fastlane closures

Access failure (host fault) → immediate refund of Studio; buyer fee
waived; goodwill credit optional.

Talent providercancel → immediate buyer refund; buyer fee waived;
reputation penalty.

G\) Timers & SLAs (confirming §3.9 addendum)

Studio access (live): P1; first response ≤ 30 minutes.

Damage claim window (host): open ≤ 24h after checkout; buyer response
48h.

Adjustment window (studio): open ≤ 24h; buyer response 48h.

Nondelivery (talent): buyer opens within acceptance window or ≤ 7 days
post autoaccept; seller response 48h.

Neutral Review decision: ≤ 5 business days after evidence windows.

Deposit autorelease: 48h postcheckout if no claim.

H\) Case Views (User & Agent)

User case detail

Timeline (events, deadlines), Outcome calculator panel, evidence list
(auto + uploaded), Proposed resolution, Accept/Decline buttons, messages
subthread.

Agent console /admin/support

Case list with SLA badges; filters; macros.

LBG outcome split view (Talent \| Studio) with oneclick apply of both.

Deposit actions (authorize/void/capture with amount + reason); evidence
viewer.

Sanctions (toggle IB off, suppress boosts, visibility throttle); strike
ladder shortcuts.

Representment kit export (PDF + evidence images/logs).

Templates: Access failure (host remedy/credit), Adjustment
approved/denied, Damage approved/denied, Talent nondelivery partial.

I\) Money Movement & Docs

Refunds: autoissue to original method; partials itemized; tax
recalculated; buyer fee refunded per rules.

Adjustments (studio): create new charge from escrow (if available) or
postcharge with receipt.

Deposit capture: separate, up to cap; no platform fee; receipt with
evidence link.

Amended docs: SOW/House Rules/Release updates autoissued on material
change orders.

J\) Special Cases & Guards

UGC/promo noncompliance: if post removed before minlive, the seller gets
one retry; else partial refund per package policy.

Expired external links: seller has 48h to refresh; timer pauses;
repeated expiry → reputation penalty.

Fraud guard: repeated loss in disputes → IB off and promotion
suppression; investigation flag to Safety.

Chargebacks: we do not charge a dispute fee unless clear abuse;
otherwise platform absorbs processor fee.

K\) Knowledge Base & Inflow Help

Inline "Learn more" links from each form screen go to KB:

evidence autoattach, and refund/charge preview.

Case types live for Talent, Studio, and LBG; Access issue is P1 with
fast lane to resolve/refund.

LBG outcome split view shows separate Talent/Studio results and a single
group summary.

Damage deposits: authorize/void/capture supported; no platform fee on
deposit capture.

Postbooking adjustments (overtime/overage/violation) supported with
evidence and timers.

UGC/promo verification integrated; minlive failures handled with one
retry then policy outcome.

Neutral Review path exists; SLA ≤ 5 business days; representment pack
exports.

Receipts & amended docs reissued automatically; tax/fees recompute
accurately.

Notifications (SFW) and timers implemented (24h/48h/5day); P1 studio
access resolves quickly.

Agent console provides macros, sanctions, deposit tools, and LBG split
outcome.

Telemetry & KPIs instrumented; dashboards track resolution rate, P1
solve time, chargebacks, and accuracy.

P\) Why this works

Predictable: Users see outcomes before filing; disputes don't feel
arbitrary.

Efficient: Autoevidence and policy math drive 70%+ selfserve resolution.

Chargebackresilient: Every case quietly builds the artifacts needed to
win bank disputes.

Fair & transparent: LBG keeps ledgers separate but summaries simple;
buyer fees and deposits behave exactly as stated in §3.1/§3.9.

§4.12 --- Payments, Payouts & Tax Center UX

Goal: Give buyers, sellers (talent), and studio hosts a clear,
trustworthy money hub: easy payments, transparent fees, predictable
payouts, multistate tax compliance, and clean audit trails---all
LBGaware, policyaccurate, and built to scale across U.S. states.

Tax Center: /billing/tax\
W9 collection (electronic), TIN match status, edelivery consent, annual
forms (1099), earnings summaries, exports.

Settings: /billing/settings\
Billing contacts, invoice branding (brands), cost centers (buyers),
currency = USD (launch).

B\) Personas & What They Can Do

Buyer / Brand: add cards/ACH, pick default at checkout, download
receipts & invoices, set cost centers/PO (when enabled), view chargeback
status, manage RFP credit purchases.

Seller (Talent) / Host (Studio): connect bank for payouts, view payout
ledger & statements, enable Early Payout (if eligible), see fee math per
booking, complete W9 and download annual forms.

Dualrole accounts: both tabs visible; payouts combine earnings across
roles and studios but keep perbooking lines separate for audit.

C\) Money Model Recap (tooltips/FAQs)

Buyer service fee: 5% per booking (3% with ACH when enabled; min \$3).

Provider fee: 12% of booking subtotal (talent:
packages/addons/license/travel; studio: hourly/cleaning).\
Discounts: Instant Book --1%, Trusted Pro --0.5%; highvalue tier: 10% on
portion \> \$1,000.

Deposits (studios): authorization holds, not GMV; captured only on
approved claims.

Escrow: funds held until Acceptance/Autoaccept (talent) or checkout
complete (studio); then queued for payout.

Early Payout: optional, peruse 0.5% on the provider fee component only,
eligibilitygated (Rep ≥ 85 + ID Verified).

Taxes: destinationbased, computed at checkout per jurisdiction; shown as
a line on receipts.

All figures shown per booking and summarized per payout; LBG shows split
lines.

D\) Payment Methods (Buyer)

Add Card\
Modal: card details; 3DS prompts when required. Set default; nickname
(e.g., "Marketing Visa").

Add ACH\
Plaidstyle link or microdeposit fallback; ribbon: "ACH reduces buyer fee
to 3%."\
Status: Pending verify • Verified • Expired consent.

Controls\
Make default, remove, retry failed method, view 3DS auth log.

Security copy\
"We never store your full card number; all data is tokenized by our
PCIcompliant processor."

E\) Checkout Integration (Buyer)

Method selector surfaces saved Card/ACH; ACH badge shows reduced fee.

If method fails → inline retry, add new method, or switch to card.

Tax calculation (automated): at review step, we call the tax engine with
role/service, price lines, date/time & service location, buyer info;
engine returns jurisdiction breakdown (state/county/city) and total tax.

If the transaction is not taxable in that jurisdiction or we're below
nexus in that state, tax shows \$0.00 with "Not applicable" tooltip.

If taxable, tax appears as a separate line with "View tax detail"
(expandable).

For LBG, we compute tax per booking and present group total; deposit
holds listed for Studio (authorization only).

F\) Payout Setup & Status (Seller/Host)

Connect bank (US)\
Instant verification preferred; fallback microdeposits.

Payout cadence\
Default 48h postacceptance/checkout (business days).\
Newprovider reserve: show current status (e.g., "First 3 payouts delayed
up to 7 days" or "10% rolling reserve: 14 days").\
Early Payout (peruse): toggle per payout; shows fee estimate and
eligibility.

Payout Ledger\
Table: Date, Payout ID, Amount, Bookings count, Breakdown link.\
Breakdown shows: gross, platform fees, tax (for info only), discounts,
adjustments, taxes collected (buyerside), net, Early Payout fee (if
used).\

Discounts/Promos; Total charged.\
Docs links (SOW, Releases, House Rules), acceptance/checkout timestamps;
method (Card/ACH; last4).

Group Receipt (LBG)\
Two sections: Talent \| Studio; separate totals + Group summary at
bottom.

Amendments\

I\) Tax Center (USfirst) --- Expanded with automation & compliance

Profiles & Onboarding

W9 collection (electronic): guided web form for U.S. persons/entities;
captures all W9 fields + perjury declaration + esignature; stores signed
form; versioning on updates.

TIN match (soft): background name/TIN validation; surface "Mismatch ---
please correct" banner to reduce 1099 errors.

Blocking rule: payouts are blocked until a valid W9 is on file (prevents
backup withholding complexity).

Edelivery consent: toggle & capture consent log for electronic delivery
of yearend forms; fallback to paper mail only if required.

Marketplace Sales Tax (explainer tile)

"We're required by state marketplace facilitator laws to collect and
remit sales tax on taxable transactions in many states. Taxes are
computed automatically at checkout based on service location and
state/local rules."

Link: "View where we collect tax" → knowledge base list
(automaintained).

YearEnd Forms (1099)

Thresholdaware messaging: dynamic banners ("On track to receive a Form
1099NEC this year" or "Below threshold; no form expected") driven by
current IRS guidance (configurable---no hardcoded amounts).

Automated generation: system compiles annual earnings (gross), uses
stored W9, and generates 1099 forms (efile to IRS + states via provider;
Combined Federal/State Filing where supported).

Delivery: issue PDF in Tax Center (by Jan 31); notify via email/app; if
no edelivery consent or not accessed by a cutoff, trigger paper mail via
provider.

Status chips: Not required • Pending • Issued; download history
retained.

Summaries & Exports

Annual summaries: gross earnings, fees, refunds, adjustments, reserves
(for personal bookkeeping).

Exports: month/quarter CSV of gross, fees, refunds, adjustments,
reserves.

Disclaimers

"We don't provide tax advice; consult a tax professional."

J\) Chargebacks, Holds & Deposits

Chargebacks (buyerside): show case status & timeline; link to Support
case; note temporary payout holds when applicable.

Seller/Host view: representment status; attached evidence; estimated
decision window.

Deposits (studio): show authorization, expiry, capture/void/release;
deposit capture generates separate receipt (no platform fee).

K\) Notifications

Buyer: payment success/failure, ACH verified, refund issued, chargeback
opened/closed.

Seller/Host: bank verified, payout queued/sent/failed, reserve changes,
Early Payout executed, chargeback opened.

Tax: W9 needed, W9 mismatch, edelivery consent needed, yearend form
available.

All notifications are SFW and privacysafe.

L\) Security, Privacy & Compliance --- Expanded

PCI DSS: handled by processor; we store only tokens.

KYC/KYB: processorhosted flows (name, DOB, EIN, beneficial owners for
entities).

PII minimization: TINs and sensitive tax data encrypted at rest
(fieldlevel), with separate key vault; strict RBAC; admin access
justified and audited.

W9 esignature compliance: electronic W9 flow meets IRS requirements
(capture consent, signature intent, full form fields, tamperevidence,
reproducible PDF).

Edelivery compliance: capture affirmative consent; provide online
access; allow optout; mail paper if consent not given or undeliverable.

Audit trail: tax engine calls (request/response summaries), tax lines
per receipt, W9 versions, TIN match results (nonsensitive codes), 1099
issuance logs, edelivery view events.

Data retention: retain W9 and 1099 records per federal/state
requirements; purge on schedule after statutory window.

Safe Mode: billing/tax emails never include explicit previews; receipts
show only SFW descriptions.

M\) Accessibility & Performance

Keyboardable forms; clear labels; ARIA for steppers/tables; highcontrast
charts.

TTI targets: \<2.0s for /billing; paginated tables with skeletons;
exports generated asynchronously with download links.

N\) Telemetry (money & tax events)

O\) Acceptance Criteria (mark 4.12 FINAL)

Billing Home snapshot tiles for upcoming charges, escrow, next payout,
wallet, tax status.

Payment Methods supports Card (3DS) & ACH, default selection, and
checkout integration with ACH fee reduction to 3% (when enabled).

Checkout calls tax engine with role/service, location, and price lines;
returns jurisdiction tax; receipts show tax line with jurisdiction
breakdown; nontaxable or nonnexus cases show \$0 with explanation.

Payouts page supports bank connect, reserve visibility, Early Payout
peruse, ledger & statements with perbooking breakdowns (role vs studio).

Receipts include single and LBG group formats; support amendments;
deposit authorizations shown distinctly.

Promotions Wallet shows Boost/Featured spend, credits, budgets; invalid
click credits itemized.

Tax Center: electronic W9 collection with esig, TIN match, payout block
until W9; edelivery consent; dynamic threshold banners; 1099 generation
& delivery (PDF download; mail fallback); annual summaries & exports.

Chargebacks & Deposits states visible to both sides; deposit captures
generate separate receipts (no platform fee).

Security/Compliance: TIN encryption at rest, RBAC, audit trails (tax
engine, W9 versions, 1099 issuance), IRScompliant eW9 & edelivery flows.

Accessibility/Performance targets met; Telemetry events fire as listed.

P\) Why this works

Compliant by design: Destinationbased tax with jurisdiction detail +
marketplace facilitator stance removes ambiguity and state risk.

Handsoff tax ops: Automated eW9, TIN match, and 1099
generation/edelivery put tax handling on autopilot with clear UX.

Transparent & trustworthy: Every receipt shows tax lines and
calculations; users can download forms and summaries easily.

Scales with us: Citybycity growth doesn't require rearchitecting
money/tax flows; we add states, not complexity.

§4.13 --- Verification Center UX

Goal: Make verification fast, private, and explainable---so good actors
unlock trust and distribution quickly, while risky behavior is filtered
early. Centralize all checks in one Verification Center, with clear
benefits, transparent progress, firm privacy controls, and compliant
workflows (ID, background, social metrics, studio).

A\) Surfaces & Routes

Verification Center home: /verify (also topnav "Verify" badge if
incomplete).

Contextual nudges: in profile editor, Checkout (Instant Book gating),
Boost setup, Studio onboarding.

Admin console (Trust): /admin/verify queue with evidence, statuses,
audits.

B\) Verification Types & Badges (what users can earn)

UX states:

Instant result: Passed → badge applied immediately.

Needs review: manual review SLA ≤ 24 h; user can continue using
platform; IB remains gated until pass.

Fail: give concrete next steps (better lighting, correct doc type) and
allow 2 more attempts before manual review.

Privacy: Store only required vectors/metadata; no raw images shown to
other users; legal name never public unless user opts in.

E\) Person --- Background Check (Trusted Pro)

Route: /verify/background → compliant consent flow

Consent & disclosure: explain scope; this is not employment, but we
follow FCRAstyle notices.

PII capture: SSN (masked in UI), address history (5 years), legal name
variations.

Run checks: national/criminal sex offender, relevant county/state,
global sanctions (where legal), identity verification.

Results taxonomy: Clear, Review, Consider with reason codes.

Connect Instagram/YouTube/TikTok/X via OAuth; request readonly insights
scopes; display exactly what we fetch.

Verified chips appear on profile/search cards (e.g., IG 182k • 2.8% ER,
"Verified via API").

Sync: nightly + manual refresh up to 3×/day (ratelimited); handles token
expiry gracefully.

Unlink: allowed; metrics fall back to selfreported (hidden by default
unless buyer toggles "include selfreported").

Manual verify path for large accounts if API unavailable (proof post,
domain verification, lightweight review).

FanSubscription Creators: supported as Creators; no explicit content
ingested; we verify the business account identity/metrics only (Safe
Mode).

live thread + booking IDs.

Device trust (Phase 2): flag new devices; email confirmation for
highrisk actions.

I\) Privacy, Data Minimization & User Controls

Data we keep (minimum): doc type, issuing country, last 4 of ID,
pass/fail tokens, facematch score bucket, verification timestamps.

What we don't keep: full ID number image beyond retention window; live
selfie video frames; background raw data beyond provider access window.

Retention: ID/Studio artifacts ≤ 30--90 days postdecision
(configurable); outcome + reference kept longer for audit.

Download my data: provide verification outcomes and submitted documents
(where lawful) upon request.

Alias vs legal: users may display an alias; legal name stays private
except on tax/legal docs.

J\) Admin Console (Trust) & Risk Engine

Queue: ID/Studio/Background/Social with SLA badges; prioritize "needs
review," highvalue sellers, foundingcity cohorts.

Background: In progress → Clear / Review / Consider; Preadverse +
Adverse notices with next steps.

Social: Connected → Verified metrics available; token expired →
Reconnect.

Studio: Under review → Verified / Action required; reverify reminders at
11 months.

System nudges: "Unlock Instant Book with ID," "Get Trusted Pro for fee
nudge and Boosts," "Verify studio to appear in Verified selector."

L\) Accessibility & Performance

All flows keyboardable; large tap targets on mobile capture; clear alt
text for instructions.

Use progress steppers, skeleton loaders; show typical decision times
(e.g., "Most ID checks \< 2 min") as informative copy.

Support lowbandwidth: allow photo upload from gallery if live capture
fails.

immutable logs.

Privacy & retention: PII minimization, encryption at rest, retention
windows, downloadmydata.

Notifications and nudge campaigns implemented; Accessibility/Performance
baselines met; Telemetry events firing.

O\) Why this works

Low friction, high signal: Users see exactly why to verify and what they
get---conversiondriving perks rather than busywork.

Safety you can feel: Clear standards, FCRAstyle fairness, and
privacybydesign build trust with models/creators and buyers.

Search quality improves: Verified supply rises to the top without
"paytowin"; risk is filtered before bookings.

Operates at scale: Vendorbacked checks, admin SLAs, audits, and recheck
cadence keep trust programs healthy citybycity.

§4.14.1 --- Access Governance & Security

Goal: Ensure admins can do their jobs safely, quickly, and accountably.
Enforce leastprivilege, protect PII, require explicit justification for
sensitive actions, and make every change auditable and alertable.

A\) Principles

Least privilege by default --- roles get only what they need.

PII is special --- tax/identity data behind extra gates; mask by
default.

Justintime elevation --- timeboxed, reasoned elevation for highrisk
actions.

Twoperson rule --- critical money/safety moves require a second
approver.

Full traceability --- immutable audit for who/what/why/when, with diffs.

Separation of duties --- no single role can initiate and approve the
same highrisk change.

Environment clarity --- bright "Sandbox/Prod" labeling; no
crosscontamination.

B\) Roles & Permission Scopes (RBAC)

Roles (no nesting; combine if needed):

Super Admin (restricted to founders/CTO): feature flags, configs,
emergency kills.

Trust & Safety: verifications, sanctions, strikes, IB toggle, content
quarantine.

Support: tickets/disputes, policybound refunds (within caps), message
redaction.

Finance: payouts/reserves, manual adjustments (with twoperson approval),
chargebacks, coupons.

Tax & Compliance: W9/TIN dashboard, 1099 runs, nexus map overrides
(dualapproval).

Content: reviews/profile/feed moderation, keyword lists, SafeMode
thresholds (preview only).

Ops (City/Market): promos, CPC floors, Featured slots, foundingcity
perks.

Marketing: homepage modules, email templates, coupon creation (no money
moves).

ReadOnly Auditor: dashboards/exports; masked PII; no changes.

Permission scopes:

PIIBasic: email, phone (masked by default; unmask requires reason).

PIISensitive: address, DOB (unmask gate).

PIITax: TIN, W9 PDFs, 1099 (Tax role only; dualapproval to unmask).

PIIBackground: consumer report artifacts (Trust only; FCRA training
required).

MoneyCritical: manual payout, fee override, deposit capture \>\$1k
(twoperson rule).

SafetyCritical: IB suppression, account hold (reason & SLA tag).

C\) Login, Session & Device Controls

SSO (admin): enforce SSO (e.g., Okta/Google), 2FA required (TOTP or
hardware key).

IP/Geo rules (optional): block risky geos; allow admin office IPs.

Session policy: 12hour max; 15minute idle timeout; reauth for sensitive
actions.

Device trust: label devices; new device prompts email confirmation.

Environment banner: persistent "PROD"/"SANDBOX" badge with color coding.

D\) JustinTime Elevation & TwoPerson Approvals

JIT elevation: click "Request elevation" → select scope (e.g.,
MoneyCritical), add reason + ticket link → manager/peer approves →
30--120 min token granted → autorevoke and log.

Twoperson rule: actions requiring cosign (examples):

Manual payout, fee override, deposit capture \>\$1k, tax nexus
overrides, adverse action finalization (background), permanent account
disable.

UI shows "Awaiting cosign" chip; approver sees payload diff before
confirming.

E\) PII Handling & Redaction

Masked by default: show •••• for sensitive fields; "Unmask (reason)"
button with scope check.

Download controls: exporting tables with PII requires scope + download
reason; big red banner with "Contains PII."

Inline redaction: Support/Content can redact userposted PII from
threads/reviews (stores original hashed reference; shows "Redacted
(Support)" tag).

PII view ledger: who accessed what PII, when, and why; exportable for
audits.

F\) Impersonation vs. ViewAs

ViewAs (safe default): renders the UI with PII masked; no write actions;
used for reproducing UI issues.

Impersonate (restricted): requires JIT elevation + reason; write actions
allowed, but money moves disabled in impersonation; session banner
"IMPERSONATING {user}"; all actions doublelogged (actor + target).

Guardrails: cannot impersonate Super Admins; timeboxed; logs include
IP/device.

G\) Audit & Change History

Immutable audit log capturing: actor, role, IP/device, route, entity
IDs, before/after diff, reason code, linked ticket/case.

Entity Timelines: on users, bookings, payouts, disputes, promotions:
chronological stack of admin/user/system events.

Searchable audits: by actor, entity, reason, time range; export to
CSV/PDF; retention policies applied.

Legal hold: mark entities to suspend purge (links to §4.14.15).

H\) Admin UI Patterns (Safety by Design)

Action drawers with required reason, preview of impact, and secondary
confirmation for risky moves.

Risk badges (P0/P1/P2) appear on threads/safety cases; timers visible.

Kill switches (flagged in §4.14.2): big, red, twostep with summary (what
services will pause, who's impacted).

Environmentaware copy: SANDBOX disallows emails/payouts; "simulation
only" labels.

I\) Alerts & Anomaly Detection

Highrisk action alerts to Slack/email: manual payouts, deposit captures,
fee overrides, permanent disables, tax overrides.

Anomaly monitors:

"TIN views by a single admin \> N/day"

"Refunds issued \> \$X in 1h"

"IB suppressions \> Y/day by same actor"

"Mass role changes"

Daily digest: PII views, highrisk actions, failed JIT requests; link to
audits.

J\) Telemetry (Admin Access Events)

admin.login.success/fail (role) • admin.session.timeout •

K\) Acceptance Criteria (mark 4.14.1 FINAL)

SSO + mandatory 2FA for all admin roles; session/timeouts enforced;
environment banner shows clearly.

RBAC roles & scopes implemented; sensitive scopes (PIITax,
PIIBackground, MoneyCritical, SafetyCritical) enforced at API and UI.

JIT elevation with reason and approver; timeboxed tokens; logs captured.

Twoperson approval on manual payouts, fee overrides, deposit capture
\>\$1k, tax nexus overrides, final adverse actions.

PII masked by default; unmask requires scope + reason; PII access ledger
visible and exportable.

ViewAs (readonly, masked) vs Impersonate (restricted, no money moves)
implemented with banners and dual logging.

Immutable audit with before/after diffs on entities; searchable and
exportable; legal hold flag present.

Alerts & anomaly rules active; Slack/email wiring; daily digest
generated.

UI safety patterns: action drawers require reasons; confirmations for
risky actions; killswitch pattern in §4.14.2.

Telemetry events fire for all listed actions.

L\) Why this works

Prevents accidental harm (leastprivilege, masked defaults,
confirmations).

Stops malicious misuse (JIT + twoperson rule + anomaly alerts +
immutable audits).

Speeds legit work (viewas to debug safely; impersonation gated for rare
cases).

Regulatoryfriendly (PII access ledger, legal holds, full diffs).

§4.14.2 --- Config & Feature Flags

Goal: Give Ops the nocode levers to launch, tune, and safeguard the
marketplace citybycity and rolebyrole. Ship a typed Config Registry,
targeted Feature Flags, safe rollouts/rollbacks, and guardrails so the
team can change policy, pricing, ranking, promos, and safety without
deployments.

A\) Scope & Principles

Single source of truth: a versioned, typed registry consumed by all
services (search, booking, billing, trust, promos).

Targeted overrides: global \< US \< state \< city \< role \< cohort
(most specific wins).

Safety rails: validation, min/max bounds, twoperson approvals for
money/safety keys.

Observable: every read/write logged; diffs, rollbacks, and blastradius
previews.

Fast & reversible: staged rollouts, scheduled publishes, oneclick
revert.

Auditfirst: immutable history with actor, reason, before/after.

B\) Config Registry (model & precedence)

Entity: config_set

Keys: namespaced (fees.provider_pct, refunds.talent.bands,
search.weights.rep ...).

Value types: boolean, int, float, money, string, enum, json (schema
enforced).

Scope: global\|US\|state\|city\|role\|cohort (compound scopes allowed,
e.g., city=HOU,role=studio).

Versioning: semantic increment; store diffs and publish notes.

Validation: schema + business rules (e.g., fees.provider_pct \>= 0.09).

Precedence: mostspecific scope overrides broader scopes; unresolved keys
inherit.

Workflows

Draft → Validate → Preview → Approve (2person for sensitive) →
Schedule/Publish → Monitor → Rollback.

Preview: simulate impact on last N searches/bookings; show KPI
guardrails.

Rollback: pick prior version; instant invalidate caches; autonotify
services.

C\) Feature Flags (targeting & kill switches)

Flag types: boolean (on/off), percentage (staged rollout), variant
(A/B), targeting (by scope/attribute).

Targeting: by city, state, role, cohort, rep_score, verified,
trusted_pro, ab_cell.

Kill switches (hard off with graceful fallbacks):

flags.instant_book.enabled

flags.promotions.boosts.enabled / flags.promotions.featured.enabled

flags.ach.enabled (fallback to card; buyer fee reverts to 5%)

flags.studio.deposits.enabled

flags.safe_mode.enabled (enforce strict previews)

flags.lbg.enabled (Linked Booking Group off → separate flows)

E\) Rollouts, Scheduling & Guardrails

Staged rollout: 1% → 10% → 50% → 100% (by city/role/cohort); automonitor
KPIs (dropdown presets).

Scheduling: publish windows (start/end), local timezone awareness.

Guardrails: block publish if validations fail (e.g., provider fee \<
floor) or if simulated KPI deltas exceed thresholds (e.g., est. takerate
−\> −3%+).

Rollback: oneclick revert; auto cachebust; notify affected modules
(webhooks).

Approvals: twoperson approval required for fees, promo pricing, tax
category map, nexus list, NSFW visibility.

Dryrun: compute outcomes (no apply) for 24h; log deltas to admin
dashboard.

F\) Admin UI (Editor)

Form + JSON dual view; live validation; inline hints; example payloads.

Diff viewer (before/after) with reason code & ticket link.

Impact preview: sample searches/rankings, bookingfee math, promo
inventory fill.

Scope picker: breadcrumb of inheritances; "show effective value" at any
scope.

History & rollback: timeline of publishes; pin "golden" configs.

G\) Service Consumption & Caching

Read path: services request effective_config(scope, key); library
resolves precedence + local cache.

Caching: inmemory TTL + eventdriven invalidation (pub/sub); 99p read
latency \< 5ms.

Bootsafe: services start with last known snapshot; failopen defaults for
noncritical keys; failclosed for safety/money keys.

Schema shared package to avoid drift; CI blocks breaking changes.

H\) Observability & Alerts

Config read metrics: hit/miss, stale fetch, latency; perservice
dashboards.

Drift detection: compare service snapshot vs registry head; alert on
mismatch.

Anomaly rules:

"Fee change \> 1% absolute in 24h across \>2 cities"

"NSFW visibility toggled in Safe Mode city"

"CPC floors moved \> \$0.20 in 1h"

Slack/email alerts on publish/rollback for sensitive domains.

I\) Telemetry (config events)

config.edit.start/validate/fail/success

config.preview.run/result (KPI deltas)

config.publish.request/approve/deny

config.publish.start/done/rollback

config.read (service, scope, key) • config.cache.invalidate

flags.toggle (name, targeting, % rollout)

§4.14.3 --- Trust & Safety Ops

Goal: Prevent harm, respond fast, and preserve marketplace integrity.
Provide Ops with clear triage, evidencedriven decisions, proportionate
sanctions, and auditable outcomes---while protecting user privacy and
complying with policy and law.

A\) Scope & Inputs

What flows in:

Safety reports (from chat, booking, profile, studio)

Automated risk signals (rate limits, device anomalies, classifier flags)

Verification results (ID, Background, Social, Studio)

Content flags (handoff to §4.14.4 for final content actions)

Dispute escalations with safety context (handoff from §4.14.5)

Case types (examples):

P0: Imminent harm, threats, stalking, underduress, doxxing, sexual
coercion, child safety.

P1: Onprem access failures, harassment, boundary violations, unsafe
location, escorting/illegal solicitation.

P2: Misrepresentation (age/identity/portfolio), spam/scams, offplatform
payment steering, policy nudity violations (previews).

B\) SLAs & Queues

P0 queue: 15 min first response, 60 min mitigation target (freeze,
contact, takedown).

P1 queue: 30 min first response, 24 h resolution target.

P2 queue: 24 h first response, 72 h resolution target.

Queue view includes: severity chip, time since opened, linked
booking/thread, user roles, location (city), verification badges, prior
strikes, and live status (e.g., "IB suppressed," "payouts frozen").

C\) Triage & Intake (Agent Playbook)

Verify severity (P0/P1/P2) from report details; upgrade severity if
signals suggest escalation.

Is there an active/linked booking? Pull: SOW/House Rules, checkin/out
timestamps, areashare logs, studio rules, delivery manifest.

Preserve evidence (oneclick): chat transcripts, attachments, IP/device,
booking metadata, profile revisions → writeonce storage with hash
(chainofcustody).

Immediate controls (if needed):

Payout freeze (partial) on involved bookings.

IB suppression on reported party (auto for P0).

DM ratelimit for suspected spam.

Profile quarantine (search hidden) pending review.

Contact counterparties via case thread (templated, safe language).

Decide: resolve, sanction, or escalate to Neutral Review Panel
(multiagent decision) for ambiguous, highimpact cases.

D\) Evidence: What Good Looks Like

System logs: booking creation/acceptance, checkin/out, location fuzz
logs, deliverables acceptance, payment attempts (incl. offplatform
keywords).

Conversations: timestamped chat, read receipts, media (with original
metadata), message redactions visible in audit.

Studio artifacts: house rules, access codes, deposit photos/evidence,
door logs if provided.

Verification: ID/Background outcomes, studio proofs, social connect
status.

User history: cancellations/noshows, prior strikes, dispute outcomes,
responsetime stats.

Agent tooling: sidebyside view, sensitive PII masked by default; "Unmask
(reason)" gated by §4.14.1 scopes.

E\) Sanctions & Remedies (Proportionate Ladder)

Soft controls:

Education notice (policy excerpt + safer alternative).

DM throttling (reduced newconversation credits for 7--30 days).

IB off for N days (auto for P1/P2; indefinite for P0 until cleared).

Boost suppression (removes promoted eligibility temporarily).

Strikes (expire after N days unless renewed):

Strike1 (30 days): visible internally; mild ranking dampening.

Strike2 (90 days): IB off, search demotion, promotions blocked.

Strike3 (180 days): account hold or suspension; payout freezes resolved
per policy.

Hard outcomes:

Account suspension (reversible with review)

Permanent disable (twoperson approval; limited to egregious or repeated
harm)

Studio delisting (Studio Verified badge revoked)

Law enforcement referral (via §4.14.15 workflow)

Autosanction triggers (configurable in §4.14.2):

≥2 P1 cases in 90 days → auto Strike2

Any P0 credible harm → Strike3 + suspension

Repeated offplatform payment attempts after warnings → IB off + DM
throttle

F\) Risk Rules Engine (ConfigDriven)

Signals: newaccount velocity, message spam patterns, offplatform payment
phrases, device mismatch, sudden rating bursts, selfclick promos, NSFW
keyword hits.

Actions: autothrottle DMs, quarantine profile, flag to T&S queue,
suppress IB, block Boosts, require reverify.

Explainability: every auto action records rule_id, inputs, and
confidence; surfaced in case panel; tunable via §4.14.2
(weights/thresholds).

Failures safe: false positives decay; manual override clears the flag
and adds rule feedback.

G\) Background & Identity (Link to §4.13)

Background "Consider/Review" → T&S evaluates role fit, recency,
rehabilitation; adverse action flow (preadverse notice, 7day response).

Underage concerns: immediate suspension, ID reverify, documentation
gate; report via child safety playbook if credible.

Impersonation/catfish: require live selfie/ID recheck; quarantine
portfolio; strike if intent to defraud.

H\) StudioSpecific Safety

Access failure (P1): verify instructions sent, code validity; if failure
owed to host → refund policy path + deposit void; if guest misconduct →
partial capture per rules.

Unsafe conditions: hazards misrepresented → Strike & delist until
corrected; require updated photos.

Thirdparty conflicts: landlord complaints or neighbor incidents →
temporary delist; require documentation.

I\) Buyer & Provider Protections (Immediate Mitigations)

Trusted Contact ping (if enabled) for delayed checkout / SOS keywords.

Relocation: for studio lockout, offer curated alternates (Houston
list) + goodwill credit (config limits in §4.14.2).

Emergency path: surface "Get help now" → safety card (nonlawenforcement
resources) + prompt to contact 911 for imminent danger (we don't
intercept emergencies).

J\) Appeals & Neutral Review

Appeal window: 14 days from sanction; one appeal per case unless new
evidence.

Neutral Review Panel: 2 T&S agents + 1 crossfunction (Support/Legal);
majority rule; document rationale.

Outcome: uphold, downgrade sanction, or overturn; update strike count
and Reputation (§4.10).

Transparency: user receives outcome with policy citations; internal
notes logged.

K\) Integrations & Handoffs

Content: NSFW/preview violations routed to §4.14.4 with case linkage;
content removal reasons synchronized.

Support/Disputes: safetycolored disputes use this case ID; refund
calculators reflect sanctions/policy.

Finance: payout freeze flags; chargeback evidence packs pull T&S
evidence.

Legal & Records: LE requests, subpoenas, child safety referrals via
§4.14.15 with limited PII access.

L\) Metrics & Quality

Operational KPIs

P0/P1 firstresponse SLA hit rate

Time to mitigation (P0 median ≤ 60m)

Safety incident rate per 1,000 bookings (target downward trend)

False positive rate (autosanctions)

Appeal overturn rate (target \< 10%)

Repeat offender rate (strike recurrence within 180 days)

IB suppression count & duration (monitor collateral impact)

Quality controls

Weekly case sampling; peer QA rubric; calibration sessions.

Rule feedback loop: promote/demote rules based on accuracy.

M\) Admin UI --- Trust Console (Key Interactions)

Case detail: timeline, linked entities, evidence panel, sanctions drawer
with reason codes, strike history.

Oneclick controls: IB off/on, DM throttle, Boost suppression, payout
freeze toggle (with reason).

Evidence pack builder: export ZIP/PDF for chargebacks or legal (hashed
manifest).

Policy helper: inline matrix preview (refund/cancellation) based on
city/role at incident time.

N\) Telemetry (Trust & Safety)

ts.case.open (severity, source) • ts.case.upgrade (P1→P0) •
ts.case.resolve (outcome)

ts.evidence.attach (type) • ts.freeze.payout.toggle • ts.ib.toggle

ts.sanction.apply (type=strike1/2/3\|suspend\|disable) •
ts.sanction.expire

ts.rule.fire (rule_id, confidence) • ts.rule.override

ts.appeal.open/resolve (result) • ts.export.pack (purpose)

O\) Acceptance Criteria (mark 4.14.3 FINAL)

Queues & SLAs for P0/P1/P2 with severity chips and timers.

Triage workflow with evidence preservation (hashed), booking/thread
linkage, and immediate controls.

Sanctions ladder implemented (education → throttles → strikes →
suspension/disable) with expiries and autotriggers.

Risk rules engine active; configurable thresholds/weights via §4.14.2;
explainable rule hits.

Background/ID links honored; adverse action flow for background checks.

Studio safety flows: access failure, unsafe conditions, delist/reverify.

Appeals & Neutral Review process with documented outcomes and updates to
Reputation.

Integrations to Content, Support/Disputes, Finance, and Legal; payout
freeze flags honored.

Trust Console UI supports oneclick controls, evidence packs, and policy
helper.

Metrics & QA dashboards live; Telemetry events fire as listed.

P\) Why this works

Fast where it matters (P0/P1 timers, oneclick mitigations) and fair
where it's complex (evidence, neutral review, expiring strikes).

Prevention + response: a configurable rule engine reduces incidents;
strong playbooks resolve the rest.

Auditable endtoend: preserved evidence, hashed manifests, reasoned
decisions, and measured quality.

§4.14.4 --- Content Moderation

Goal: Keep the platform SFW by default, protect users from harmful or
deceptive content, and maintain highquality discovery. Combine automated
screening, human review, clear policies, and appeals---with auditable
outcomes and city/role tunability via §4.14.2.

A\) Scope & Content Types

Moderated surfaces

Profiles (avatar, cover, bio), Service Profiles (per role), Portfolio
(images/videos), Feed posts, Reviews & responses, Studio pages (photos,
amenities), RFP briefs (buyer text), Gig listings/cards (search cards,
ribbons).

Not public but scanned

DM attachments (virus only; policy checks on reported threads),
Deliverables manifests (names/sizes/hash only), House Rules/SOW text
(for prohibited clauses).

Policy anchors (SFW)

Allowed: artistic, nonsexual imagery; fashion/fitness/glamour; implied
nudity that remains SFW in previews.

Prohibited: explicit sexual content; pornographic poses; fetish content;
solicitation of sexual services; child/younglooking sexualized content;
hateful symbols; doxxing/PII in public fields; offplatform payment
steering.

OnlyFans / Fansubscription creators: supported as "Creators", but no
explicit content is uploaded or displayed; metrics/identity only (per
§4.13).

B\) Pipeline Overview (Upload → Screen → Publish)

Upload → temporary pending state (placeholders with skeletons).

Automated screening (subsecond):

NSFW classifier (preview threshold from §4.14.2
classifier.threshold.preview).

Nudity mask: detects areola/genital zones; triggers autocrop/blur
overlay tool.

OCR for embedded PII (emails, phone #, payment handles).

Text filters on titles/captions/hashtags (slurs, sexual solicitation,
offplatform payment phrases).

Duplicate/perceptual hash check (copyright/banlist).

Virus/malware scan (for videos).

Policy decision:

Autopublish if fully SFW (green).

Borderline → autoblur/autocrop; publish with "sensitive" overlay;
enqueue human review SLA ≤ 24h.

Block & queue if explicit/illegal or disallowed text (red).

Human review (moderation queue) → Approve / BlurandPublish / Remove with
reason / Escalate to T&S (§4.14.3).

Publish → search cards always use SFW thumbnails; portfolio detail uses
SFW or blur taptoreveal (if marked sensitive but allowed).

Firsttime uploader policy: premoderate first N=10 portfolio items
(editable via §4.14.2) to set quality baseline.

C\) Queues & SLAs

Priority A (P0/P1 handoff from T&S): explicit sexual/child
safety/violent threats → immediate takedown, SLA 15--30 min.

Priority B (policy/borderline): nudity boundaries, hate symbols,
offplatform payment steering → SLA 24 h.

Priority C (quality/metadata): miscategorization, spam,
duplicate/loweffort → SLA 72 h.

Queue cards show: surface (profile/portfolio/feed), uploader role, city,
verification badges, classifier confidence, prior violations, and report
count.

D\) Rules by Surface

Profiles & Service Profiles

Avatar/cover must be SFW; bios may not include contact handles or
payment details; location granular to city (no home address).

Role tags and NSFW switches are not usercontrolled; they derive from
content classification and policy.

Portfolio

Must remain SFW in preview. If artistic nudity is present, the system
enforces autocrop/blur for thumbnails and grid previews.

No exposed genitals; female nipples not visible in previews; implied
nudity ok with strategic coverage.

Feed posts

Same preview constraints as portfolio; no explicit calltooffplatform
payments; collaboration tags require consent (accept/deny).

Reviews

Disallow slurs, harassment, doxxing, explicit language; allow
experiencebased criticism.

Only verified booking participants can post (per §1.4).

Studios

Images show space/amenities only; no explicit sets; safety disclosures
required for hazardous features.

RFP briefs

Disallow sexualized gig requests; disallow offplatform payment
instructions; require budget ranges.

E\) Automated Signals & Thresholds (configurable via §4.14.2)

NSFW classifier with three bands: allow, sensitiveallow (blur), block.

OCR PII detection: email/phone/payment handles → autoredact in public
captions; warn uploader.

Keyword denylist (nsfw.keyword_denylist): sexual solicitation, hate
slurs, offplatform payment verbs/handles.

Hash banlist: known abusive images (internal + partner lists).

Spam heuristics: rapid identical posts, URL stuffing, engagement bait →
throttle.

F\) UserFacing UX

During upload: live preview shows autocrop/blur; user can adjust crop
within SFW bounds (hard stops).

After decision:

Approved: normal publish.

Sensitiveallow: blur overlay with "Tap to view" + policy tooltip.

Removed: user receives reason code, policy excerpt, and appeal link.

Tagging: tagged collaborators must accept before content shows on their
profile/feed.

Education nudges: "Previews must be SFW---here's how to crop/cover."

G\) Enforcement & Escalation

Autoactions on violation counts (rolling 30 days):

2 content removals → Content warning + education card.

3 removals → DM throttle + search demotion.

4 removals → IB off and Boost suppression; queue to T&S.

Hard violations (explicit sexual content, child/younglooking sexualized,
hate symbols) → immediate takedown + Strike2/3 (T&S ladder) and
potential suspension.

Appeals: within 14 days; reviewed by a separate moderator or Neutral
Review if highimpact.

H\) Tools for Moderators

Sidebyside original vs preview thumbnail; crop grid overlay; sensitive
area heatmap.

Redact inline (captions/hashtags); system stores hash of original.

Batch actions for spam waves; bulk restore/remove with single reason.

Simulateas card: preview how a search card will render postdecision.

Policy helper: quick links to current §1.5 rules and cityspecific
appendums.

I\) Integrations & Handoffs

Trust & Safety (§4.14.3): escalations (P0/P1), sanctions ladder updates,
strike sync.

Search (§4.14.2): demotion flags, sensitiveallow affects ranking weights
(minor).

Support (§4.14.5): user communications, appeal tickets, macros.

Promotions (§3.3): promoted inventory excludes "sensitiveallow" unless
explicitly allowed by config.

Verification (§4.13): repeated misrepresentation → require reverify.

J\) Metrics & Quality

Operational KPIs

Autoapprove ratio (target ≥ 85% after first10 gating phase)

Timetodecision median (Priority B ≤ 8h)

Appeal rate & overturn rate (goal \< 10% overturn)

Repeat violation rate (per 30/90 days)

Sensitiveallow share and CTR impact (ensure buyer trust)

Offplatform payment phrase incidence (monthovermonth ↓)

M\) Why this works

SFW by design keeps payment partners comfortable and buyers confident,
while still enabling artistic expression.

Fast automation + human judgment gives scale without losing nuance.

Clear user tools (crop/blur, appeals) reduce friction and educate
creators.

Tunable policies via §4.14.2 let Ops adjust thresholds citybycity
without code

§4.14.5 --- Support & Disputes

E\) Calculators (nocode, policyaccurate)

Refund Calculator\
Inputs: role, cancel timing or lateness, price lines
(packages/addons/license/travel), policy bands.\
Output: buyer refund \$; provider clawback \$; platform fee adjustments;
who pays processor fees per policy.\
Oneclick Apply → posts ledger events + issues amended receipt (§4.12).

Delivery/Acceptance Calculator\
Inputs: due date, posted date, items delivered vs promised, acceptance
window, revision rounds left.\
Output: "Eligible for partial refund X%" or "Request revision" path;
sets autoreminder in the thread.

Inputs: geo distance (map link), city override bands from §4.14.2.\
Output: allowable travel fee or adjustment recommendation.

Deposit Claim Calculator (Studios)\
Inputs: evidence, claimed damages types, cap %, expiry.\
Output: capture up to \$Y; requires twoperson approval when \>
threshold.

F\) Standard Workflows (Playbooks)

1\) Reschedule / Change Order

Propose new time; pricing delta autocomputed; both parties accept → SOW
updates → amended receipt.

2\) Buyer Noshow

Confirm arrival logs; provider/studio present?

Policy outcome: buyer forfeits %; provider paid per bands; strike
optional if abuse.

Confirm location logs; attempt contact in thread.

Outcome: refund buyer; provider forfeits; strike (T&S); remove Boost
eligibility window.

4\) Late / Partial Delivery

Run Delivery calculator; offer revision first if within rounds;
otherwise partial refund per matrix.

5\) Quality Dispute

Require 3 examples & rationale; compare to SOW.

If subjective with adequate delivery, educate + deny; if objective miss,
partial refund.

6\) Studio Access Failure

Validate instructions sent and code logs; if host fault → full/partial
refund; deposit void.

Offer Relocation (city curated list) + goodwill credit (config caps).

Readonly Auditors.\
What it controls: payout batches & reserves, Early Payouts,
refunds/credits, studio deposits, chargebacks/representment,
coupons/promos, daily reconciliation, revenue recognition exports.

Guardrails: Moneycritical actions require twoperson approval per §4.14.1
(manual payout, fee override, deposit capture \> \$1k, tax category
overrides).

B\) Ledgers & Money Objects (model)

indicators for T&S risk engine

KPIs

Win rate, average liability, time to representment, scheme reasons top10

G\) Coupons & Promotions (Money Ops)

Create coupons (percent/flat), scope by city/role/user cohort;
start/end; stack rules; usage limits; code vs autoapply

L\) Acceptance Criteria (mark 4.14.6 FINAL)

Payout batches with retry/changebank and reserve visibility; Early
Payout peruse with fee math.

Reserves (newprovider & rolling) configurable via §4.14.2; applied &
released with schedules.

Refunds/Adjustments recompute fees/taxes and issue amended receipts
automatically.

Studio deposits: holds visible; capture/void/release with evidence and
dualapproval \> threshold; separate receipt.

Chargebacks: webhook ingestion, evidence pack builder, representment
submission, payout freezes.

Coupons/Promos: create/manage; burn tracking; wallet line items posted.

Reconciliation & RevRec exports: daily variances, monthend packs,
escrow/tax/deposit liabilities tieouts.

Runbooks & Alerts documented and wired; telemetry events emitted;
dashboards live.

M\) Why this works

Ops speed without risk: common money flows are oneclick with calculators
and dual approvals.

Clean books by default: escrow vs revenue vs liabilities handled
consistently; audits are painless.

Loss containment: reserves, evidence packs, and alerts reduce chargeback
and refund leakage.

Citybycity control: economics tuned in §4.14.2; Finance executes without
code.

§4.14.7 --- Tax & Compliance Ops

Goal: Operate U.S. taxes and compliance without code changes: collect
W9s, resolve TIN mismatches, run and deliver 1099s, manage marketplace
salestax (destinationbased) with a tax engine, file remittances on time,
and keep a defensible audit trail---with dual approvals on sensitive
moves.

A\) Scope & Roles

Who uses this: Finance (lead), Tax & Compliance, Readonly Auditor;
limited Support (view-only for ticket replies).\
What it covers: W9 onboarding & edelivery consent, TIN matching, 1099
generation/efile/delivery/corrections, marketplace salestax nexus
tracking, tax category mapping, calculation monitoring, return filing
calendar, audit pack exports.

Guardrails: Changes that affect tax exposure (nexus list, category map,
backdated overrides, rate overrides) require twoperson approval per
§4.14.1.

B\) Dashboards & Queues

Tax Overview (/admin/tax)

Tiles: W9 coverage %, TIN mismatch open, 1099 run status, states with
nexus, calc error rate, next filings due.

Trendlines: taxable vs nontaxable share by role; effective tax collected
by state/city.

Queues

W9 Missing/Invalid (payoutblocking on): missing, expired name/TIN,
signature not captured.

TIN Mismatch: new mismatches, under review, resolved.

1099 Exceptions: address issues, duplicate TINs, threshold edge cases,
bounced emails, paper mail required.

Calc Exceptions: timeouts, "no code found," zero tax where expected,
jurisdiction mismatch.

C\) W9 / TIN / EDelivery Management

W9 Control Panel

Status filters: Not started • In progress • Submitted • Valid • Needs
correction.

Actions: Request W9 (nudge), Resend link, Block payouts toggle
(automated default ON when missing), Mark corrected after user
resubmits.

Evidence: signed PDF, submission timestamp, IP/device, consent texts.

TIN Match (soft)

Batch and ondemand checks; results classified: Match • Mismatch •
Indeterminate.

Workflow: On mismatch → Notify user (selfserve fix) → if unresolved in 7
days, escalate to Support for assisted correction → remain
payoutblocked.

Audit: history of match attempts, result codes; no raw SSN ever shown
(PII scope gates per §4.14.1).

EDelivery Consent

Global percentage, by cohort.

Actions: Request consent template, Revoke on user request.

If no consent or unopened by deadline, queue paper mail fulfillment with
address verification.

D\) 1099 Runs & Corrections

Config (no code)

Thresholds: dynamic edition (managed by Finance) with notes; never
hardcoded into receipts.

Form type: platformissued 1099NEC vs processorissued (if using PSE
route) --- select per tax season.

Run windows: preclose (draft), final generate, efile, deliver (by Jan 31
target).

Run Workflow

Preflight: snapshot gross payouts, exclude refunds/chargebacks as policy
dictates; show exceptions (missing W9, TIN mismatch, missing address).

Preview: perpayee summary with deltas vs prior drafts; download sample
PDFs; dual approval to proceed.

Efile: submit batch to filing provider (IRS + Combined Federal/State
where applicable); capture submission IDs.

Deliver: email with secure link to PDF for consented users; queue mail
for the rest; track opens and bounces.

Corrections: create CCORR entries with reason (address fix, amount
update, TIN correction); refile and redeliver; maintain version chain.

Status & Controls

States: Draft • Pending approval • Filed • Delivered • Correction
pending.

Bounced/undeliverable queue with address change flow (Support can help).

Export 1099 Ledger CSV: payee, TIN masked, gross, box amounts, file IDs.

E\) SalesTax Nexus & Category Mapping (Marketplace Facilitator)

Nexus Map

States list with toggles: Collect & remit ON/OFF, basis
(economic/physical), notes.

Economic triggers monitor: GMV and transaction count by state vs
configurable thresholds; alert if approaching.

Twoperson approval to mark a state ON/OFF; prompt to schedule effective
date/time.

Category Mapping (what is being taxed)

Role/service to tax code mapping (e.g., Talent service,
Photography/Videography service, Studio shortterm rental, Cleaning fee,
Digital license).

Editor: pick codes from tax engine catalog; perstate overrides where
needed; reason required; dual approval for overrides.

Simulation: price example shows expected tax in a target city/county;
compares before/after.

Exemptions (Phase 2)

Buyer tax exemption certificates: upload, verify, expire; statespecific
validation; apply per booking only if valid and applicable; audit record
kept.

F\) Calculation Monitoring & Exceptions

Live Monitor

Success %, latency p95/p99; top states/cities by volume.

"Zero where expected" detector: service/location combos historically
taxable now returning 0.

Timeouts: fallback policy (failclosed for money safety) blocks checkout
or shows "Tax unavailable---please retry"; agent override path (rare)
requires dual approval and postfix reconciliation.

Exception Resolution

No code found: add/adjust category mapping; rerun calc; annotate case.

Jurisdiction mismatch: verify location; correct geocode; recalc.

Engine outage: enable grace mode flag (killswitch in §4.14.2) →
temporarily suspend new checkouts or switch to backup strategy;
autonotify Eng/Ops.

G\) Filing Calendar & Remittance

Calendar

State filing frequencies (monthly/quarterly/annual) with due dates;
owner assigned; reminders at T14/T7/T2 days.

Each filing stores: period, gross taxable, tax collected, returns

K\) Acceptance Criteria (mark 4.14.7 FINAL)

W9/TIN module with payoutblock, consent capture, mismatch workflow, and
signed PDFs stored with audit.

1099 run system: preflight, preview, dualapproval, efile,
edelivery/paper fallback, corrections flow with version chain.

Nexus map and economic triggers; twoperson approval to toggle; scheduled
effective dates.

Category mapping editor with simulation; perstate overrides; approvals &
audit.

Calc monitor with latency, errorrate, and "zero where expected"
detectors; outage grace mode.

Filing calendar with reminders, submission records, confirmations, and
jurisdiction exports.

KB links & templates maintained via §4.14.10; Support sees statuses for
ticket replies.

Metrics & alerts dashboards; Telemetry events for all listed actions.

L\) Why this works

Automates the heavy lifting (forms, calcs, filings) while keeping humans
in the loop where judgment matters.

Prevents surprises with nexus monitoring, exception queues, and dual
approvals on exposurechanging edits.

Auditable & defensible: signed forms, efile IDs, mapping changes, and
filing confirmations are all in one place.

§4.14.8 --- Promotions & Marketplace Economics

Goal: Give Ops/Marketing a nocode control tower for paid visibility that
drives incremental bookings without corrupting relevance: configure CPC
floors and Featured pricing citybycity, tune Quality Score (QS) weights,
enforce density/frequency caps, manage eligibility/safety, run
experiments, and measure true incrementality (ROAS)---all with
guardrails, audits, and rollbacks.

A\) Scope, Roles & Guardrails

Who uses this: Ops (city/market), Marketing, Finance (billing/credits),
Trust & Safety (eligibility), Readonly Auditor.\
What it controls: Search Boost (CPC), Featured Carousels (weekly flat),
eligibility gates, QS weighting, density/frequency caps, citytier CPC
floors, delivery guarantees & makegoods, experiments, fraud controls,
wallet credits.\
Guardrails: "Never paytowin"---paid units must match query/filters; caps
enforced (≤2/20; ≤1 above fold); Promoted label shown; safety
eligibility in effect (ID Verified + Rep ≥ 70 + no recent strikes).

B\) Inventory Model (what can be sold)

Search Results Boost (CPC)

Placement: inline search cards; ribbons autogenerated ("Instant Book",
"Trusted Pro", "Available this week").

Capacity controls: density cap per page and frequency caps per buyer
(config in §4.14.2).

Charging: per valid click (invalid click credits autoapply to wallet).

Featured Carousels (Weekly Flat)

Placement: Home + category landing ("Featured in Houston"; "Featured
Photographers").

Slots: 10--16 per carousel; rotational pacing with impression guarantees
& makegood logic.

Creative rules: No custom creatives. We render the standard profile
card + approved ribbon variants only (prevents deception and review
load).

C\) City Tiers & Pricing Governance

City tiers: A (e.g., HOU/DAL/LA/NYC/ATL), B (growth metros), C
(smaller).

CPC floors per city×role (e.g., HOU:model = \$0.90) and weekly Featured
prices per city×role (e.g., \$69/wk).

Scheduling: price changes can be scheduled (start/end) with local
timezone; staged rollouts.

Review cadence: monthly CPC floor review (±\$0.10--0.20) based on fill
rate, CPB, ROAS; quarterly Featured pricing review (impression delivery
& bookings/slot).

Dual approval: any CPC floor increase ≥ \$0.20 in 24h, or Featured price
change ≥ 20% requires twoperson approval (per §4.14.1).

Keys live in §4.14.2: promos.boosts.cpc_floor.city_role,
promos.featured.weekly_price.city_role.

D\) Eligibility, Targeting & Safety

Eligibility rule (configurable DSL): default id_verified && rep\>=70 &&
!recent_strike.

NSFW/Safe Mode: paid units respect city NSFW visibility and Safe Mode
thresholds (from §4.14.2).

Targeting knobs: city, radius, role; negative keywords (provider can
exclude).

Autosuppression: any active Safety investigation or miscategorized
profile → campaign paused until cleared.

E\) Ranking Inside Paid Caps (fair ordering)

Within paid slots only:

Quality Score (0--1) components (weights tunable in §4.14.2):

Exact filter match fit (role/location/price/availability)

Responsiveness (firstresponse time & rate)

Rep Score

Instant Book enabled

Price fit to query median

Historical CTR (timedecayed)

Paid Order Score: score = log(bid) \* α + QS \* (1−α) (default α=0.5;
guardrails 0.3--0.7).

Tiebreak: lower effective CPC (bid ÷ QS) wins to reward relevance.

Keys: promos.boosts.qs_weight_bid, promos.boosts.qs_weight_quality.

F\) Fraud, Quality & Budget Protection

Invalid click detection: rapid repeats, zerodwell bounces, selfclick
signatures, coordinated patterns; invalidated charges autocredit within
24h to wallet.

Frequency caps (buyerside): 2 impressions/session, 5/day/provider, 4h
cooldown.

Budget safety: daily overspend guard (≤5%); autopause if anomaly; alert
Ops.

Abuse flags: misleading pricing or availability → autopause all promos;
route to T&S.

G\) Admin UI --- Controls & Flows

1\) Floors & Pricing Editor

Table per city×role: CPC floor \$, avg QS, fill %, median CPC, CPB,
ROAS; edit floors inline; schedule changes; staged rollout slider.

Featured grid: weekly price ladder; slots booked vs inventory;
impression guarantees; set makegood rules (auto credit or extension).

2\) Eligibility & Caps

Toggle eligibility DSL (with validator), set density/frequency caps; set
ribbon allowlist.

3\) QS Weights & Preview

Adjust α and QS subweights (guardrails); simulate ordering on last N
queries; diff view vs current.

4\) Experiments

Create A/B cells: density caps A(2/20) vs B(1/20); QS α 0.5 vs 0.3;
ribbon text variants.

Set success metrics (ROAS lift, CPB↓, buyer CTR↑); autostop on trust KPI
breach (e.g., "Hide promoted" \> 3%).

5\) Credits & MakeGoods

Issue wallet credits (invalid clicks, makegood for underdelivered
Featured); caps and reasons required; ledger posted to Finance.

6\) Reporting

Dashboards: adoption %, spend, CPC distribution, CPB, bookings
attributed, incremental GMV (holdout), ROAS percentiles, invalid click
rate, buyer "Hide" rate, revenue contribution.

H\) Measurement & Incrementality

Attribution: click → inquiry → booking → GMV; 7day postclick window;
firsttouch within paid.

Holdout design: rolling 10% eligible supply suppressed from paid to
estimate incremental bookings/GMV; configurable (5--10%).

Core KPIs: median ROAS ≥ 2.5×, CPB targets by role, invalid click rate
\< 7%, buyer "Hide promoted" ≤ 3%, paid revenue mix 10--15% by month 6.

Cohort views: new vs returning providers; city cohorts; role cohorts.

I\) Finance & Billing Integration

Wallet ledger: CPC charges (valid clicks), Featured weekly charges,
invalid click credits, makegoods.

Prepaid vs payasyougo: support both; card on file; lowbalance alerts.

Refund policy: only invalid clicks autocredit; Featured makegoods issued
on short delivery (impressions) or outages.

J\) Alerts & Safeguards

Spend spike \> X% houroverhour in a city/role.

Invalid clicks \> 10% for any provider in 24h.

Buyer "Hide promoted" rate \> 3% dayoverday.

ROAS median \< 2.0× for 7 days in a city → suggest floor drop or QS
tuning.

Inventory saturation: density cap hits 90% for 3 days → consider raising
floor or adding slots cautiously (with A/B).

K\) Telemetry (Promotions)

L\) Acceptance Criteria (mark 4.14.8 FINAL)

CPC floors and Featured weekly pricing editable per city×role;
scheduled; dualapproval for large changes.

Eligibility rule editor with validator; safety gating enforced (ID
Verified + Rep ≥ 70 + no strikes).

Density & frequency caps configurable; respected at runtime; Promoted
labeling present.

QS weights tunable with simulation; ordering formula log(bid)\*α +
QS\*(1−α) enforced within paid slots only.

Fraud controls: invalid click detection with autocredits; overspend
guard; abuse autopause.

Experiments on caps, QS α, ribbons; autostop on trust KPI breach.

Reporting: spend, CPC, CPB, attributed bookings/GMV, incremental ROAS
via holdout, invalid click & hide rates, revenue contribution.

Wallet & Finance linkage for charges, credits, makegoods; audit trail
intact.

Alerts on spikes, quality thresholds, low ROAS, inventory saturation;
Telemetry events firing.

M\) Why this works

Citybycity control without code lets you stabilize early markets and
price inventory rationally.

Fairness preserved: relevance first, paid only in marked slots, strict
caps---so buyers trust results.

Provable value keeps spend durable (holdoutmeasured ROAS).

Operationally safe: fraud shielding, autocredits, experiments with
guardrails, and quick rollbacks.

§4.14.9 --- City Ops & Supply Seeding

Goal: Give Ops a nocode cockpit to launch and grow each city: set supply
targets by role, seed highquality providers and studios, run
foundingcity perks, balance demand vs. supply, and keep
rotations/spotlights fair---without code changes.

A\) Scope, Roles & Guardrails

breadth of bookings.

Tight integration with Promotions, Verification, Finance, and Support
ensures moves are both effective and auditable.

§4.14.10 --- Smart Docs & Templates CMS

Goal: Let Ops/Legal/Marketing manage contracts, releases, SOWs, House
Rules, and comms (email/SMS) without code---using a versioned clause
library, safe variables, approvals, localization, and oneclick
rollout/rollback. All documents and messages should be policyaccurate,
esignable, and auditable, and slot cleanly into booking, delivery,
disputes, and receipts.

travel/overtime, cancellation summary.

Releases (18+ enforced) and IP/license addenda; esign capture; PDFs
hashed and linked to bookings/receipts.

House Rules packs with deposit clauses; neighborhood privacy; studio
evidence checklist.

Support macros & appeal templates with tone guard and variables.

Email/SMS CMS with A/B variants, quiet hours, unsubscribe compliance;
transactional never suppressed.

Integrations to Checkout, Messaging, Receipts, Disputes, Promotions;
pinned document versions by booking.

Governance: owners, change windows, audits, legal approvals enforced.

Metrics & telemetry dashboards for adoption, disputes defensibility,
comms performance.

Q\) Why this works

Opsspeed changes without code keep docs and comms aligned with live
policy and city conditions.

Pinned, signed, and hashed records raise trust and win
disputes/chargebacks.

Role and cityaware assembly means one source supports many scenarios,
cleanly.

Guardrails & approvals prevent risky edits from slipping into
production.

§4.14.11 --- Studios Ops

Goal: Operate the studio side of the marketplace without code changes:
verify studios, enforce House Rules & deposits, manage coverage by
neighborhood, keep checkin smooth and safe, and tie studios cleanly into
LBG (Linked Booking Group) flows with talent---while preserving SFW
standards and strong audit trails.

A\) Scope, Roles & Guardrails

Who uses this: Studios Ops (lead), Trust & Safety, City Ops, Support,
Finance, Content Moderation, Readonly Auditor.\
What it controls: studio onboarding & verification, listing standards,
amenities taxonomy, House Rules packs, deposit defaults & captures,
access/"lockout" handling, safety & compliance fields, visibility in
search/featured, coverage heatmaps, and LBG ties.

Guardrails:

"Studio Verified" badge requires documentation + photo checks; twoperson
approval to revoke badges or capture deposits \> cap (§4.14.6).

No explicit sets; previews must remain SFW (enforced via §4.14.4).

Address privacy: exact address never public preconfirmation;
neighborhood shown until accept.

B\) Studio Onboarding & Verification

Onboarding checklist (adminconfigurable in §4.14.10):

Identity & ownership (choose 1+): lease/utility bill, business
registration, or property manager letter.

Address proof: document + GPSstamped photos (entrance, main room, key
amenities).

Minimum photos (≥12): wide + detail shots; safety items (first aid,
exits) included.

House Rules pack applied (from CMS) with required fields (access,
occupancy, noise, hazards).

Deposits setting (optional): % + cap (defaults from §4.14.2).

Safety & compliance fields: smoke detectors, fire extinguishers, ADA
access, elevators/stairs, parking, neighborhood notes.

Contact method for dayof (masked relay); optional codelock provider
field (logs may be uploaded).

Verification console actions:

Approve / Request changes / Reject (with reasons & examples).

Badge: Studio Verified; badge expires on reverify cadence (12--18 mo).

Reverify queue with reminder emails, autodowngrade if overdue.

C\) Listing Standards & Amenity Taxonomy

Amenity taxonomy (managed in §4.14.2): cyclorama, natural light,
blackout, sound treatment, dressing room, kitchenette, showers, parking,
freight elevator, seamless paper, Cstands, strobes, modifiers,
backdrops, props.\
Blacklisted amenities/rules: hidden cameras, explicit/sexual sets,
escorting/solicitation, dangerous stunts without licensed supervision,
weapons, pyrotechnics (unless permitted), smoking indoors (unless
ventilation + permit), offplatform payment instructions.\
Photo guidelines: no explicit imagery; show space, not people in
sexualized poses; watermarks permitted but unobtrusive.

Moderation: studio listings flow through §4.14.4 queues;
misrepresentation → strike ladder (§4.14.3) and delist until corrected.

D\) House Rules Packs & Safety Addenda (CMSdriven)

House Rules templates (cityaware): access windows, quiet hours,
occupancy cap, gear usage, cleanup, alcohol/drugs, pets, minors on set,
chaperone policy, privacy areas, changing area rules.

Safety Addenda (optional): ladders/rigging rules, fog/haze restrictions,
electrical load limits, mandatory COI for certain rigs.

Autoinsert clauses based on amenities (e.g., cyc wall → no shoes/scuffs;
haze → detectors policy).

City addenda (noise ordinances, loading zones) appended automatically.

E\) Deposits & Damage Claims (with Finance integration)

Defaults (config in §4.14.2):

studio.deposit.default_pct (e.g., 20%); studio.deposit.cap_money (e.g.,
\$250); auth expiry (e.g., 7 days).

Cleaning fee min (e.g., \$25) and overtime rate rules (per 30min
increments).

Operations:

Hold at checkout (separate from GMV); visible in receipts (§4.12).

Claim flow: host uploads timestamped photos + rule reference → Deposit
Claim Calculator suggests capture amount (§4.14.5).

Capture/void/release managed in Finance (§4.14.6); \> cap or \> \$1k
needs dual approval; separate deposit receipt emitted.

Edge cases:

Auth expiring in 24h → alert host + Support; bulk void tool (§4.14.6
runbooks).

Disputed capture → Neutral Review (§4.14.5) with evidence pack.

F\) Access Management & Lockout Handling

Access types: onsite host, code lock, concierge checkin, key pickup;
captured in House Rules.

Lockout signals: repeated code failures, buyer "at door" SOS, phone
relay unanswered.

Playbook: verify instructions sent → check code validity (if logs
provided) → if host fault, refund path + deposit void; if buyer fault,
apply policy bands.

Relocation: surface city's backup studio list; goodwill credit within
caps (§4.14.2).

G\) Availability, Pricing & Visibility Controls

Admin knobs (no code):

Minimum booking duration (e.g., 2h), starttime increments (15/30/60m),
max party size.

Overtime billing rule (per 15/30/60m, grace period).

Cleaning fee band and "reset time" between bookings.

Visibility tier: Verified only appears in "Studio selector" at checkout;
unverified can exist but rank lower or require manual approval.

Featured eligibility (per §4.14.8) and weekly price ladder by city×role.

Search facet toggles: amenities, district/neighborhood, natural light,
sound treatment, max occupancy, deposit required.

H\) LBG (Linked Booking Group) TieIns

Studio + Talent legs autogrouped for cart/checkout; each has its own
SOW/House Rules and receipts but a Group receipt summarizes both
(§4.12).

Change orders allow moving one leg while warning if the other conflicts;
conflict resolution wizard proposes nearest alternatives.

Disputes are legscoped; refund one leg without touching the other;
Support calculators handle prorates (§4.14.5).

I\) Studio Seeding & Coverage (with City Ops)

Coverage heatmap: neighborhoods with bookings vs demand; targets defined
in §4.14.9.

Outreach tools: import local studio lists; template packs for
invitations (discounted Featured, verification subsidies).

Quality gates: require Studio Verified for carousel placement; deposit
defaults autoapplied.

J\) Compliance & Insurance (lighttouch)

COI upload field (optional/required based on amenity---e.g., aerial
rigs); expiry tracking; reminder 30 days prior.

Local regulations: note fields for special permits (fire, drone,
alcohol); checklist acknowledges compliance.

Underage protections: if minors allowed by House Rules, enforce
chaperone clause and IDverified guardian signature.

K\) Support & Safety Integrations

Access failures autoopen Support case (P1) with House Rules and code
logs attached (§4.14.5).

Unsafe conditions reports route to T&S; delist until fixes verified
(§4.14.3).

Moderation: listing images/text scanned per §4.14.4; explicit sets
blocked; appeals possible.

L\) Metrics & Alerts

KPIs

Verification coverage (# Verified Studios, % of studio supply).

Access failure rate (per 100 bookings), deposit claim rate & win %.

Dispute rate (studio leg) and time to resolve.

Utilization: hours booked / hours available; overtime incidence.

Image quality pass rate at moderation; COI validity %.

Coverage by neighborhood vs target (green/yellow/red).

Alerts

Lockouts \> threshold/day; deposit auths expiring \> threshold; COI
expiring in ≤30 days; neighborhood coverage gaps; repeated unsafe
condition reports.

M\) Telemetry (Studios Ops)

studio.verify.submit/approve/reject/reverify_due

studio.listing.photo.upload/flag/approve

studio.rules.apply/update • studio.deposit.config.update

studio.deposit.claim.open/capture/void/release

studio.visibility.tier.update • studio.featured.assign

studio.coverage.alert • studio.coi.upload/expire

N\) Acceptance Criteria (mark 4.14.11 FINAL)

Onboarding & verification flow with evidence, GPSstamped photos, House
Rules packs, and badge issuance/reverify cadence.

Amenity taxonomy and blacklist enforced; listing photos moderated for
SFW previews.

Deposits configured per city; holds at checkout; claim flow with
evidence and calculator; captures/voids in Finance.

Access & lockout playbooks with relocation option and goodwill credits
within caps.

Availability/pricing knobs (min duration, increments, overtime, cleaning
fee); visibility tiering and search facets.

LBG support: group checkout, legscoped disputes, group receipt, conflict
wizard.

Compliance fields (COI, permits); reminder system for expiries.

City coverage heatmap & seeding hooks; Featured eligibility integration.

Metrics, alerts, telemetry dashboards live; audit trails for all
actions.

O\) Why this works

Trustable supply (verified, documented, SFW) that plugs directly into
your booking, dispute, and finance rails.

Smooth dayof operations (clear House Rules, access, deposits) cut
Support load and refunds.

City growth ready with coverage targets, seeding tools, and fair
visibility.

Nocode adjustments keep you nimble as you scale studios alongside
talent.

§4.14.12 --- Data & Reporting (Admin UI)

Goal: Give nonengineering teams one place to see how the marketplace is
performing, diagnose issues, and act---without raw SQL. Dashboards are
curated, LBGaware, privacysafe, and tie back to exact definitions in a
shared metric catalog. Exports and alerts are scheduled, and everything
is auditable. (Section 5 will specify the data warehouse schema & event
contracts.)

A\) Scope, Roles & Guardrails

Who uses this: Execs, City Ops, Marketing/Promotions, Trust & Safety,
Content Moderation, Support, Finance/Tax, Studios Ops, Product.\
What it covers: Curated dashboards, drilldowns, cohorting/segmentation,
scheduled reports, anomaly alerts, CSV/JSON exports.\
Guardrails:

RBAC mirrors §4.14.1 (Admin Security).

PII masked by default; unmask requires scope + reason.

LBG vs leg metrics are clearly labeled.

All numbers show definition tooltips linking to the Metric Catalog.

B\) Metric Catalog (sourceoftruth)

Catalog entries include: name, owner, business definition, SQL/logic
hash, event sources, time grain, inclusions/exclusions, and version.\
Examples

gmv_total (LBG sum, excludes deposits; refunds netted)

bookings_count (LBG count; includes completed & accepted scheduled)

take_rate_net ( (provider_fee + buyer_fee − processor_fees −
invalid_click_credits) / GMV )

rep_score_avg (roleweighted, timedecayed average)

promos_roas_incremental (holdoutbased; §3.3)

safety_incidents_per_1k (P0+P1 cases / 1,000 LBGs)

calc_error_rate_tax (tax calc exceptions / tax calc requests)

Governance

Every dashboard tile references a catalog key with version (e.g.,
take_rate_net@v2).

Changes trigger deprecation windows and "what changed?" diffs.

C\) Data Freshness & Reliability

Freshness badges on every page: "Updated 8 min ago" with SLA:
nearrealtime (≤15 min) for ops; daily for monthend finance.

Backfill indicators when a replay job is running; "partial" banner on
affected tiles.

Destinations: Slack channels (teamspecific) and email; each alert links
to the dashboard deeplink and relevant admin tool.

I\) Privacy, PII & SafeMode Display

PII masking by default; unmask requires scope + reason; downloads
watermark the requester.

SFW previews only (no explicit thumbnails in dashboards).

Aggregation thresholds: hide tiles for cohorts \< N to avoid
reidentification.

GDPR/CCPA hooks: (futureproof) report excludes deleted/anonymized users.

J\) LBG vs Leg Accounting

Toggle: "View as LBG" (grouped) vs "View legs" (talent/studio separate).

KPIs indicate which base is used (badge: LBG SUM or LEG SUM).

Exports include both views with join keys.

K\) Admin UI Patterns

§4.14.5 (open case), §4.14.6 (finance event), §4.14.7 (nexus switch),
§4.14.10 (edit template).

Warehouse: every tile shows the dataset table/view powering it; "Open in
warehouse" (readonly for Analysts).

M\) Metrics & Quality Ops

Data QA dashboard: event drop rates, late arrivals, schema errors,
backfill status.

Reconciliation: GMV per dashboard vs finance exports; discrepancy tile
with thresholds.

Ownership: each dashboard has an owner and oncall rotation for data
quality.

N\) Telemetry (Data UI)

data.dashboard.view (name) • data.tile.click (metric_key)

data.filter.apply • data.export.run (scope, rows) •
data.schedule.create/run/fail

data.alert.fire/ack/resolve (rule_id)

data.metric.version.change (key, old→new)

data.drilldown.open (entity_type) • data.deep_link.out

O\) Acceptance Criteria (mark 4.14.12 FINAL)

Metric Catalog exists; every tile references a catalog key+version with
definition tooltip.

Freshness badges, backfill banners, and data quality checks present on
all dashboards.

Curated dashboards for Marketplace, City Ops, Growth, Search &
Conversion, Promotions, T&S, Moderation, Support, Finance, Tax, Studios,
Experiments.

Filters/segments/cohorts work globally; cohort retention and funnel
views implemented.

Drilldowns to entities/cases; deep links into admin tools.

Exports (CSV/JSON/parquet) and scheduled reports (email/Slack) with RBAC
& masking.

Alerts and anomaly rules configurable; fire to Slack/email with
dashboard links.

PII/SafeMode protections: masking, aggregation thresholds, SFW previews,
watermarking.

LBG vs leg toggle implemented; labeled KPIs and exports.

Telemetry events and data QA dashboards live; owner per dashboard
assigned.

P\) Why this works

Puts the right numbers in front of each team with shared definitions, so
decisions are aligned.

Nearrealtime ops plus monthend depth covers both daily steering and
financial truth.

Privacysafe and actionlinked (deep links) means insights turn into
changes quickly.

Versioned metrics keep trust high even as we refine logic.

§4.14.13 --- Observability & Incident Response

Goal: Detect issues early, respond fast, and recover safely---without
exposing PII or requiring code changes. Provide a unified status
cockpit, clear SLOs/alerts, oneclick degradations/kill switches, tested
runbooks, disciplined postmortems, and links into every admin tool that
matters.

A\) Scope, Roles & Guardrails

Who uses this: OnCall (Product/Platform), SRE/Ops, City Ops (read),
Support Leads, Trust & Safety Leads, Finance (payout incidents), Legal
(for P0 comms approvals).\
What it covers: service health, dependency health, synthetic checks,
error budgets, alerts & paging, incident command, comms,
degradations/killswitches (from §4.14.2), runbooks, postmortems, and
status page publishing.

Guardrails:

Paging thresholds & killswitches are configdriven (see §4.14.2) with
twoperson approval for money/safety toggles.

PIIsafe logs only; sensitive views still respect §4.14.1 scopes.

B\) SLOs, SLIs & Error Budgets

Toplevel SLOs (Prod, monthly):

Checkout success (card/ACH): ≥ 99.5% 2xx within p95 latency ≤ 2.5s.

Booking create/accept: ≥ 99.7% success, p95 ≤ 1.5s.

Search: p95 ≤ 800ms, 99.9% availability.

Payout queue: ≥ 99% of eligible payouts queued within 2h of completion;
failure rate \< 0.5%.

Uploads & moderation pipeline: 99% of images/videos scanned within 60s;
backlog \< 2k items.

Tax calc: p95 ≤ 1.5s; exception rate \< 0.5%.

Promotions delivery: spend pacing error \< 5% daily; invalid click
falsenegative rate \< 2%.

SLIs monitored: success rate, latency p50/p95/p99, saturation (queue
depth, CPU/mem), dependency errors, synthetic check pass rate, error
budget burn (1h/6h/24h).

C\) Health Cockpit (Admin → Observability)

Status board tiles: API, Search, Checkout (Card/ACH), Escrow, Payouts,
Promotions, Uploads/Moderation, Tax Engine, Background Check, Studio
Deposits, Messaging, Notifications.\
Each tile shows current SLI/SLO, trend sparkline, errorbudget burn, and
degrade/kill buttons (where safe).\
Dependency pane: external provider status ingest; shows current
incidents & ETA.

Synthetic monitors:

Buyer path: search → profile → add to cart → checkout (card/ACH) →
receipt.

Seller path: accept → deliverables upload → acceptance.

Studio path: calendar → checkout with deposit hold.\
Runs per city (Houston focus + 3 canaries) every minute.

D\) Alerting Policy & Paging

Severities

S0 (P0): Platformwide checkout failure, data loss risk, security breach
→ page immediately (phone/SMS/Slack) to OnCall + Incident Commander
(IC).

S1 (P1): Degraded key flow in any city (e.g., Houston), payout stall,
tax calc outage, promotions overspend → page OnCall.

S2: Elevated error or latency with autoretries; backlog growth; single
dependency degraded → Slack alert to channel; acknowledge within 30 min.

S3: Nonurgent anomalies & dataquality drifts → daily digest.

Threshold examples (editable in §4.14.2):

Checkout success \< 98.5% 10min window (S1); \< 95% 5min (S0).

Tax exceptions \> 2% 15min (S1).

Payout failures \> 1% 30min (S1).

Promotions spend pacing \> +10% houroverhour (S1).

Upload backlog \> 5k or scan p95 \> 120s (S2).

Escalation: IC assigns Ops Lead, Comms/Scribe, and Resolver; if no ack
in 5 min, escalate to secondary.

E\) Incident Lifecycle (declare → close)

Detect (monitor or report) → Declare severity & IC in the tool.

Stabilize: apply degradation/kill switches (see G), raise banners, slow
traffic if needed, open support macro.

Communicate: internal incident room; post to public status page if
S0/S1; cadence every 30--60 min until resolved.

Mitigate & validate: rollbacks, feature flag flips, traffic shifting,
provider fallback.

Resolve: all SLIs normal; remove banners; undegrade; mark "Resolved".

Postmortem: within 5 business days---blameless, action items with
owners/deadlines.

Comms templates (from §4.14.10): internal alert, stakeholder update,
public status page incident, "all clear."

F\) Degradations & Kill Switches (oneclick)

Degrade (preferred) before kill: keeps core value flowing.

Checkout: disable ACH (fallback to card; buyer fee reverts to 5%);
disable multileg/LBG (separate flows) if grouping breaks.

Promotions: pause Featured, keep CPC with stricter caps; or pause all
paid Boosts.

Tax: grace mode---block checkout with clear retry banner (failclosed for
money safety) or delay acceptance with "tax pending" flag (adminapproved
only).

Uploads: switch to queueonly (no preview generation) and lengthen
moderation SLA; throttle size per file.

Payouts: enqueue only, delay send with banner; communicate ETAs to
sellers.

Background checks: switch to IDonly gating temporarily; queue requests.

Studio deposits: disable new auths (fallback to cleaning fee) if PSP
deposit path fails.

Kill switches (hard off; see §4.14.2): Instant Book, Promotions, LBG,
ACH, Deposits, Safe Mode stricton. All require reason + twoperson
approval for money/safety.

G\) Runbooks (top 12)

Card processor incident → route to fallback region; if full outage:
block checkout with banner; open S0; ACH off; autoretry queue.

ACH/Bank link outage → kill ACH; buyer fee back to 5%; announce;
reenable when synthetic passes 30 min.

Tax engine down → enable tax grace mode; hold checkouts or delay
acceptance (policy); alert Finance; reprice none.

Payouts failing → freeze sends; display "payout delayed" in UI; retry
after root cause; notify sellers.

Search index degraded → fall back to cached results/top N; disable
advanced filters; rebuild offline.

Uploads S3/CDN issue → switch to reduced image sizes; queue video; show
"processing longer than usual."

Moderation classifier offline → enforce SFW blur defaults; premoderate
first N items; ramp back after checks.

Promotions overspend anomaly → immediate CPC cap; pause Featured; credit
wallet for overdelivery; rootcause invalid clicks.

Spam/abuse wave → tighten DM caps; block offplatform keywords;
autoquarantine new accounts; T&S mass actions.

Studio lockout spike → open city relocation list; goodwill credit
budget; contact affected bookings.

Feature flag misconfig → oneclick rollback to last known good; diff
viewer; require approver notes.

Data pipeline delay → show "partial" freshness banner; queue scheduled
reports; notify dashboard users.

Each runbook includes: owner, steps, rollback, comms template,
postincident checks.

H\) Change Management & Safeguards

Staged rollout for risky configs (1%→10%→50%→100%); autoabort on
guardrail breach (conversion, checkout, error rate).

Release freeze windows (city launches, holidays).

Preprod synthetic runs parallel to Prod.

Canaries: mirror 1--5% traffic.

Autorollback if error budget 1h burn exceeds threshold.

I\) Logging, Tracing & PII Hygiene

Structured logs with request_id, booking_id, city, role; no plaintext
PII (emails, phones, TINs) ever logged; use tokens only.

Distributed tracing across services; trace viewer limited to Admin
roles; sampling adjustable during incidents.

Retention: app logs 14--30 days; security/finance events 1--3 years (per
policy).

Access: masked views by default; unmask gated by §4.14.1 scopes +
reason.

J\) Backups, Recovery & Continuity

RPO/RTO targets: RPO ≤ 15 min, RTO ≤ 2 h for critical data stores.

Backups: pointintime for primary DB; object storage with lifecycle;
daily job integrity checks; quarterly restore drills.

Event replay: appendonly event bus; replay tools to rebuild search
indexes, counters, and derived aggregates.

External links manifest (deliverables): names/sizes/hashes enable
dispute handling even if thirdparty storage hiccups.

K\) Public Status Page & Comms

Components: API, Checkout, Payouts, Search, Uploads/Media, Promotions,
Tax Engine, Background Checks, Studio Deposits.

Incident workflow: draft → Legal quick review for S0 "wording" →
publish; cadence every 30--60 min; "resolved" with root cause summary
and next steps.

Subscribe: email/RSS.

Transparency guardrails: never include PII; keep copy SFW.

L\) Postmortems (Blameless)

Trigger: any S0, or S1 \> 30 min, or repeat S2 within 7 days.

Structure: what/impact/timeline/where we were blind/root cause(s)/what
helped/hurt/fixes/owners/dates; link to diffs & flags; attach
dashboards.

Action tracking: owners & due dates; reminders; escalation if overdue.

Learning loop: update runbooks/alerts/guardrails; review in weekly ops.

M\) Metrics & Alerts (Observability Program)

MTTD/MTTR (by severity), % incidents detected by monitors vs user
reports (target \> 80% monitors).

Error budget used per SLO; number of autorollbacks; changefailure rate;
paging fatigue (alerts/week/engineer).

Runbook coverage: incidents with matching runbook; time to first
mitigation.

Comms: time from declare → first status page update.

N\) Telemetry (Obs & Incidents)

obs.sli.update (name, value, slo_target) • obs.error_budget.burn

incident.declare (sev, ic, reason) • incident.page/ack/escalate

incident.degrade.on/off (flag) • incident.kill.on/off (flag)

incident.status.update (public\|internal) • incident.resolve

postmortem.create/publish • runbook.open/complete

obs.alert.fire/ack/resolve (rule_id) • obs.synthetic.fail/pass

O\) Acceptance Criteria (mark 4.14.13 FINAL)

Status cockpit with SLIs/SLOs, error budgets, dependency health, and
oneclick degradations/kill switches.

Alerting policy with severities, thresholds, paging & escalation;
editable via §4.14.2.

Incident workflow (IC assignment, roles, comms cadence, banners, status
page publishing).

Runbooks for top 12 scenarios; linked buttons in cockpit; tested
quarterly.

Change safeguards: staged rollout, guardrails, autorollback; freeze
windows.

PIIsafe logging & tracing with RBAC; retention policies applied.

Backups & restore drills meeting RPO/RTO; event replay tools.

Postmortems with action tracking; program metrics & quarterly review.

Telemetry events emitted; dashboards for MTTD/MTTR, alert volumes, error
budgets.

P\) Why this works

Find fast, fix fast: crisp SLOs and a cockpit that puts degradations and
runbooks one click away.

Safe by design: money/safety toggles require approvals; PII never leaks;
comms stay clear and SFW.

Continuous learning: postmortems feed runbooks and guardrails so
incidents trend down as the platform scales.

§4.14.14 --- Bulk Tools & Migrations

Goal: Give Ops/Support/Finance the power to make large, safe, reversible
changes---without code. Handle duplicates, reindexing, citywide policy
rollouts, mass refunds/credits, campaign adjustments, board/content
moves, and backfills with dryruns, guardrails, approvals, scheduling,
and audit trails. LBGaware, moneysafe, privacysafe.

A\) Scope, Roles & Guardrails

Who uses this: Super Admin (rare), Ops Leads, Support Leads, Finance,
City Ops, Trust & Safety (specific flows), Content Moderation (specific
flows), Readonly Auditor.

What it can change (entity families):

Users & Accounts (merge, role/profile reparenting, verification status
sync)

Bookings & LBGs (link/unlink legs, acceptance window extensions,
deliverables due date shifts)

Money Objects (bulk refunds/credits/fee adjustments with amended
receipts)

Promotions (boost/featured campaigns: pause/price floor align, budget
edits)

Search/Index & Social Metrics (reindex, backfill, recalc Rep, resync
social metrics)

Boards & Content (move/retag favorites, reassign tagged collaborators)

Studios (policy parameter updates: deposits, cleaning fees, min
durations)

Policy Attachments (SOW/release/House Rules addenda to future/affected
bookings)

Guardrails (always on):

Twoperson approval for money, safety, PIIsensitive, or irreversible
actions.

Dryrun + blastradius preview with sample rows required.

Chunked execution, idempotency keys, resume on failure.

Autogenerate rollback plan (where feasible) + snapshots.

Mask PII in previews; unmask gated by §4.14.1 scopes.

B\) Common Bulk Job Flow (wizard)

Select Operation → entity family + action (see sections below).

Define Target Set → filters (city, role, date range, status,
verification, Rep decile, campaign status, etc.) + optional CSV list
(IDs/emails).

DryRun & Preview → show count, 50row sample (before/after), impacted
KPIs (e.g., total refund \$), dependency checks (e.g., open disputes?).

Risk & Guardrails → flags needed (MoneyCritical, SafetyCritical), limits
(max \$/booking, max \$ total, max rows).

Schedule & Pace → start/end window (local city TZ), batch size,
interbatch delay, offpeak default.

Approvals → second approver with diff viewer.

Execute & Monitor → progress bar, perbatch logs, error bucket with
retry.

Notify (optional) → attach Smart Docs/Comms templates (§4.14.10) to
inform impacted users.

Rollback (if supported) → oneclick create inverse job template prefilled
from snapshot.

Job record includes: actor, reason code, linked ticket, scopes, filters,
dryrun snapshot hash, approvals, schedule, outcome stats, CSV of
affected IDs (downloadable, masked).

C\) Users & Accounts --- Merge & Normalize

Use cases: duplicate signups (email + social), creator with split role
accounts, brand team consolidation.

Actions:

LinkandHold (soft stage, reversible 7 days): mark profiles as aliases;
both URLs redirect to a canonical; present "pending merge" banner in
Admin; no data is moved yet.

Finalize Merge (irreversible): unify login identities, verifications
(highest wins with audit), W9/TIN (prompt to pick primary; alternate
archived), payout method (choose primary), portfolios (dedupe media via
hash), reviews (union), Rep score (recompute with decay), DM threads
(reassign to canonical), promotions wallets (sum balances), boards
(union).

Role/Profile Reparent: move a service profile (e.g., Photographer) from
user A to user B (rare; requires proof + approvals).

Guardrails:

Twoperson approval; no ongoing payout/chargeback on either account; no
active safety cases.

Rollback: only from LinkandHold. After Finalize, a reversal = new merge
job in opposite direction not allowed (must escalate to engineering).

Comms: notify both emails; require reauth next login.

D\) Bookings & LBG --- Relate, Retime, Addenda

Use cases: early legs created separately need grouping; acceptance
window policy changed; stormrelated deliverables extension.

Actions:

Link to LBG: select talent/studio bookings within same buyer + window →
create Group; generate Group Receipt (§4.12).

Unlink leg (rare): leg removed from LBG (keeps its receipts); requires
Support case link.

Acceptance Window Extend: push acceptance due date by N days on open
bookings (config max).

Deliverables Due Shift: move due dates; optional autoaddendum via Smart
Docs; both parties notified.

Policy Addendum: attach a SOW/House Rules addendum to future or open
bookings; requires reaccept in thread.

Guardrails: no money lines altered unless paired with Change Order;
respect city policy keys (§4.14.2); log all changes & notify.

E\) Money --- Safe Bulk Refunds / Credits / Fee Fixes

Use cases: processor outage partial refunds, tax miscalc in one
state/day, goodwill credit wave after access failures.

Actions:

Refunds (partial/full): reasoncoded; perline (packages, addons, travel,
license); recompute fees/taxes; issue amended receipts (§4.12).

Credits (platform wallet): city/role scoped; expirations; ledger post
(§4.14.6).

Fee Adjustment (rare): buyer or provider fee correction for window;
twoperson approval; bounded by floor/cap.

Deposit Voids (studio): mass void for auths expiring due to outage.

Guardrails:

Global caps: max \$ per booking, \$ total, \# rows; chargebackexcluded;
safety cases excluded.

Dual approval; dryrun shows totals; Finance visibility during execution.

Rollback: credits reversible (issue offset); refunds not (issue
countercharge only with consent → avoided).

F\) Promotions --- Campaign Adjustments

Use cases: raise floors citywide; pause Featured during outage; align
active bids to new floors.

Actions:

Pause/Resume active Boost or Featured campaigns (filters: city×role, Rep
tier, budget left).

Floor Alignment: if bid \< floor, autoraise to floor (optin); notify
providers.

Budget & Dates: extend end dates, add makegood credits.

Bulk credit for invalid clicks during incident (ties into §4.14.8
wallet).

Guardrails: eligibility enforced; Finance ledger posts; notify affected
users (template).

G\) Search/Index & Social --- Reindex, Recalc, Resync

Use cases: new facet weights; rep formula tweak; social API outage
recovery.

Actions:

Reindex profiles/search with new §4.14.2 weights or facet toggles;
chunked by city.

Rep Recalc: recompute scores for selected cohorts (e.g., HOU
photographers); publish atomically.

Social Resync: refresh IG/TT/YT/X metrics for affected accounts
(ratelimited; respect API quotas); mark verified/unverified chips
accordingly.

NSFW Rescan: rerun classifier on portfolio thumbnails when threshold
changes; rewrite preview crops.

Guardrails: throttle; backoff on provider API limits; banner "metrics
refreshing" on profiles.

H\) Boards & Content --- Move, Retag, Reassign

Use cases: consolidate user's boards, fix mistagged collaborators after
merge, remove content from feeds.

Actions:

Move items between boards; rename/merge boards; preserve creation dates.

Retag collaborators on content to new canonical user (after merge); send
consent prompt again if needed.

Remove or reprivacy content in policy migrations (e.g., stricter preview
rules) with reason + appeal link.

Guardrails: respect collaborator consent states; moderation rules
(§4.14.4) rerun on moved items.

I\) Studios --- Policy Parameter Updates

Use cases: city raises default deposits; cleaning fee minima update; min
duration changes.

Actions:

Deposit %/cap updates to listings; choose: apply to new bookings only or
also to open (future) bookings via addendum + reaccept.

Cleaning fee minima mass set; min duration increased; starttime
increment adjusted.

Visibility tier: demote unverified studios from carousels.

Guardrails: LBGaware; generate addenda; Finance deposit holds adjusted
only on new checkouts (never silently increased on existing bookings).

J\) Previews, Simulation & Impact Checks

For every job:

Count & sample (before/after columns).

Impact tiles: total refunds \$, \# bookings affected, \# users to
notify, campaigns paused, index rebuild time estimate.

Dependency warnings: "10 bookings have open disputes", "5 users under
safety investigation", "25 payouts queued".

KPI simulation (when applicable): expected takerate delta, ROAS effect
range, search ranking drift.

K\) Scheduling, Chunking & Idempotency

Chunk size defaults (e.g., 500 users; 2,000 bookings; 10,000 index
docs).

Pacing: interbatch delay (e.g., 2--10s), offpeak windows (cityaware).

Idempotency: each batch writes a job_id + batch_id footprint; retries
skip alreadydone rows.

Resume: pick up from last successful batch; Stop is safe; Requeue failed
only.

Rate limits: external API calls (social, PSP) throttled; exponential
backoff.

L\) Communications (optional but recommended)

Attach email/SMS templates (§4.14.10) per job type (refund notice,
policy addendum, campaign pause, merge confirm).

Quiet hours respected; city timezone aware.

"Why you're seeing this" copy autofilled with reason code and policy
link.

M\) Data Integrity & Audit

Snapshot prechange: affected rows (IDs, key fields) hashed and archived.

Immutable job log: inputs, approvals, batches, outcomes, error list.

Entity timelines updated (e.g., "Bulk refund JOB123 applied 20251104").

Downloadables: CSV of results (masked), error CSV, notification list.

N\) Metrics & Alerts

KPIs

Job success %; average retry rate; rollback rate; time to completion.

Money jobs: total \$ moved, variance vs preview (target \< 1%).

Index jobs: doc rebuild throughput, search latency impact.

Comms: open/click/complaint rate on notices.

Safety: user reports spike postjob (guardrail metric).

Alerts

Batch error rate \> threshold; preview vs actual deltas; money cap
nearing; API ratelimit stalls; search p95 \> SLA during reindex.

O\) Telemetry (Bulk Ops)

bulk.job.create/preview/approve/schedule/start/progress/finish/fail/rollback

bulk.scope.resolve (counts) • bulk.sample.fetch

bulk.guardrail.block (reason) • bulk.approval.add

bulk.notify.send/fail • bulk.retry.batch

bulk.money.total_delta • bulk.index.docs_processed

bulk.rollback.create/finish

P\) Acceptance Criteria (mark 4.14.14 FINAL)

Unified Bulk Job wizard with filters, dryrun, approvals, schedule,
monitoring, rollback templates.

User merge with LinkandHold → Finalize;
payout/W9/TIN/payout/portfolio/reviews/DMs/boards consolidation;
redirects set; audit logged.

LBG tools: link/unlink legs, acceptance/delivery date shifts, addenda
attach + reaccept flow.

Money jobs: refunds/credits/fee fixes with caps, recomputed fees/taxes,
amended receipts, Finance ledger posts.

Promotions jobs: pause/resume, floor alignment, budget/date edits,
invalidclick makegoods.

Index & metrics jobs: reindex, Rep recalc, social resync, NSFW
rescan---throttled & resumable.

Boards/content: move/merge boards, retag collaborators, reprivacy
content with appeals links.

Studio policy updates: deposit %, caps, cleaning/min duration with
addenda options; no silent increases on existing bookings.

Scheduling/chunking/idempotency and PIIsafe previews; detailed job logs
& snapshots.

Metrics/alerts/telemetry for success, deltas, errors, and performance
impact.

Q\) Why this works

Ops speed, safely: Big changes happen during offpeak with previews,
caps, and approvals.

Reversible where possible: snapshots and rollback templates reduce fear
and downtime.

Money and policyaware: recomputes fees/taxes, issues amended receipts,
triggers addenda and reacceptance where users must opt in.

Scales with growth: chunked, resumable, idempotent jobs keep risk low as
data volume rises.

§4.14.15 --- Legal & Records

Goal: Handle subpoenas/LE requests, litigation holds, datasubject
actions, and retention/deletion safely and defensibly---with
leastprivilege access, full audit trails, reliable exports, and clear
coordination with Trust/Safety, Support, and Finance. Keep engineers out
of the loop for routine matters; make exceptional cases twoperson
approved and PIIsafe.

A\) Scope, Roles & Guardrails

Who uses this: Legal (owner), Privacy/Compliance, Trust & Safety Leads
(read/assist), Support Leads (DSR assist), Finance/Tax (view for
records), Readonly Auditor.

What it covers:

Intake & verification of subpoenas, warrants, and LE requests (USonly).

Case vaults and legal holds that suspend deletion/retention timers.

Data retention schedules & purge jobs for system records (chat,
bookings, docs, logs).

Data Subject Requests (DSR): access/export, deletion (where allowed),
and optout logging.

Clickwrap & consent logs (ToS/Privacy, Edelivery).

Discovery exports: review sets with PII redaction and hashed manifests.

Guardrails:

Twoperson approval for any data disclosure or hold release (Legal +
Privacy).

PII scopes enforced (see §4.14.1): only Legal role can unmask PIITax and
PIIBackground inside exports.

Chainofcustody hashing on every produced file.

Gag order awareness: suppress user notifications where order shown and
recorded.

B\) Intake & Triage (Subpoenas / LE Requests)

Intake form (upload + metadata): issuer, type (subpoena/warrant/court
order/civil), jurisdiction, case number, served date/time, compliance
deadline, scope (user(s), timeframe), gag order flag, contact info.\
Verification checklist: signature and court details, jurisdiction match
(US), acceptable service method.\
Routing: autoopen Legal case with SLA timers (e.g., acknowledge within 2
business days; faster for warrants).\
Scope precheck: search users/bookings to confirm identifiers; if
insufficient, send clarification template (via Smart Docs §4.14.10).

Case view includes: timeline, documents, internal notes, holds applied,
disclosure decisions, produced packages, and recipients.

C\) Legal Holds (Litigation / Investigations)

Apply hold to: user(s), booking(s)/LBG(s), studio(s), or a time range
across systems.

Effect: freezes deletion jobs, retention clocks, and purge eligibility
for the bound entities; banners appear in Admin entity timelines.

Hold reasons: litigation, LE request, internal investigation, tax/audit.

Release hold: requires twoperson approval; reasons recorded; downstream
purge job reevaluates.

SLA reminders: hold reviews every N days; stale holds flagged.

D\) Retention Schedules & Purge Jobs (USfirst)

Policy profiles (editable, with Legal approval):

Operational data (bookings, receipts, payouts): 7 years.

Chat/message content: 2 years (unless tied to dispute/hold).

Moderation & T&S case records: 5 years.

Logs/telemetry (nonfinancial): 30--90 days depending on sensitivity.

Uploads (thumbnails/manifests): as long as portfolio item exists;
deleted 30 days after account deletion unless under hold.

Tax records (W9/1099 summaries): 7 years; forms stored encrypted with
restricted scope.

Purge engine: nightly job evaluates each record against policy & holds;
performs softdelete → grace → harddelete; writes a purge ledger entry
with counts and IDs (masked).\
Simulation mode: preview impact before policy changes; "blastradius"
diff and rollback window.

E\) Data Subject Requests (DSR) --- Access / Deletion / OptOut

(USonly launch; CPRAstyle patterns to futureproof.)

Access/Export (Data Copy)

Intake: authenticated user or verified requestor; scope (account,
timeframe).

Output: ZIP with JSON/CSV for profile, settings, bookings/LBG, receipts,
messages (thread transcripts), reviews, references, moderation decisions
(nonconfidential summaries), verification statuses (pass/fail),
consents.

Redactions: thirdparty PII (emails/phones) masked unless consent or
legal basis; background/tax data summarized, not raw.

Hash manifest and cover letter (generated via §4.14.10).

SLA target: 45 days (configurable).

Deletion (Right to Delete)

Eligibility rules: block if active booking/dispute/chargeback/hold or
retention obligations (finance/tax).

Partial deletion: remove public content (portfolio/feed), mask profile,
stop discoverability; preserve billing/contract records under retention
and any items under legal hold.

Tombstone logic: display "Deleted User" on historic threads/receipts.

Coolingoff window (e.g., 14 days) with cancellation option; after
window, irreversible purge runs (except retained records).

SLA: 45 days to complete when eligible.

OptOut (Sale/Sharing of data / Marketing)

Track consent and optouts; update messaging lists; record timestamp,
IP/device.

Do Not Sell/Share toggle (futureproof); tie to analytics adsharing flags
if applied later.

Status tracker: per request: received → verifying → in progress →
completed/denied (with reason). Templates for responses in §4.14.10.

F\) Discovery & Production (Civil/Criminal)

Search & collect: entity filters (user, booking range, city), keyword
search across chats and metadata, time bounds.\
Review workspace: preview items with PII masked by default; unmask
gated; tag (responsive/nonresponsive/privileged).\
Redaction tools: blocklist (emails/phones/payment handles), manual
area/line redaction in PDFs, autoredact minors' identifiers.\
Production packages:

Formats: PDF (with redactions), CSV/JSON for structured data, original
media hashes and links (we provide manifests for thirdparty storage like
Drive/Dropbox rather than duplicating large files).

Hash manifest (per file + whole set), cover letter, case metadata.

Chainofcustody: who exported, when, with which scopes; twoperson
approval for release.

Notification rules: where permitted, notify users whose data is
produced; suppressed if gag order recorded.

G\) Policies & ClickWrap/Consent Logs

ToS/Privacy versions, with acceptance timestamps, IP/device, and
surfaces (web/app).

Edelivery consent (tax forms) and marketing consents with granularity
(email/SMS).

Changes: version diffs stored; user reconsent waves scheduled via
§4.14.10.

Download: CSV of acceptance logs by cohort (PII masked) for audits.

H\) Integrations

Trust & Safety (§4.14.3): reference cases, import preserved evidence
into holds; share redacted summaries.

Support & Disputes (§4.14.5): DSR status surface to agents; macro
responses.

Finance & Tax (§4.14.6/§4.14.7): retention overrides for financial/tax
records; W9/1099 forms access gated to Legal.

Docs CMS (§4.14.10): generate cover letters, denial reasons,
clarification requests, and disclosure receipts.

I\) Metrics & SLAs

KPIs

DSR intake volume; % completed on time; average completion days.

Holds applied/active/reviewed; average hold age.

Productions count; average time from verified request → production;
redaction error rate (\<1%).

Purge job throughput and exceptions; records deleted vs retained (by
policy).

Consent coverage: ToS/Privacy acceptance %, Edelivery consent %.

Alerts

DSR backlog \> threshold or any nearing SLA breach (T7/T3/T1 days).

Holds older than review cadence.

Purge errors \> threshold; production export failures.

K\) Acceptance Criteria (mark 4.14.15 FINAL)

Intake & verification flow for subpoenas/LE requests with case vault,
SLA timers, and clarification templates.

Legal holds that freeze deletion and display banners; twoperson approval
to release; periodic review reminders.

Retention schedules configurable; purge engine with simulation, nightly
runs, and purge ledger.

DSR: access/export ZIP with redactions & hashes; deletion flow with
tombstones, coolingoff, and eligibility rules; optout toggles logged.

Discovery workspace: search, masked preview, tagging, redaction,
production with hashed manifest and chainofcustody; twoperson release
approval.

Clickwrap & consent logs queryable and exportable.

Integrations with T&S, Support, Finance/Tax, and Smart Docs;
notifications per policy/gag orders.

Metrics & alerts dashboards; Telemetry events emitted for all actions;
RBAC & PII scopes enforced.

L\) Why this works

Defensible: verified intake, documented holds, hashed productions, and
auditable purges.

Practical: redaction and manifests avoid duplicating huge media while
still producing what's required.

Safe by default: masking, leastprivilege, and twoperson approvals keep
sensitive actions controlled.

Lowcode ops: Legal drives routine compliance without engineering; only
edge cases need dev help.

§4.14.16 --- Sandbox & Training

Goal: Give every ops team a safe, realistic playground to learn,
rehearse, and validate workflows---without touching production or real
PII. Provide seeded demo data, simulators for external partners, guided
role training, incident drills, and QA/UAT tooling---with hard
isolation, audits, and oneclick resets.

A\) Scope, Roles & Guardrails

Who uses this: Support, Trust & Safety, City Ops, Finance/Tax, Studios
Ops, Content Moderation, Marketing/Ops, Product, Legal (training),
Readonly Auditors.

What it covers: Environment isolation, anonymized/procedural data,
seeders & scenario packs, fake gateways (payments/tax/ID/background),
webhook simulators, guided curricula, incident drills & chaos tests,
QA/UAT flows, resets & snapshots, reporting.

Guardrails:

No real PII ever enters Sandbox. Exports disabled; screenshots
watermarked "SANDBOX."

Separate SSO & RBAC realms (distinct login & MFA).

Feature flags & configs edited in Sandbox have no effect on Prod
(crossenv writes are blocked).

Network egress from Sandbox limited to simulators and allowlisted
endpoints.

B\) Environments & Isolation

DEV (for builders), SANDBOX (ops training & UAT), STAGE (preprod perf
tests), PROD.

Prominent environment banner + URL subdomain color coding.

Data segregation: unique databases, storage buckets, and API keys per
environment; killswitches default ON in Sandbox for moneymoving actions.

Email/SMS sink: all outbound comms land in a searchable "Message Inbox"
viewer (no real delivery).

C\) Data Strategy (synthetic + anonymized refresh)

Synthetic baseline: cityaccurate Houston cohort plus two satellite
cities; 90day booking history; realistic distributions for roles, Rep
Scores, prices, availability, and social metrics.

Anonymized refresh (optional): scheduled job builds fully anonymized
aggregates from Prod (counts, medians, distributions)---never raw PII.
Deterministic tokenization (formatpreserving) creates realistic but
nonreversible names/handles.

Media: stock & inhouse SFW sets with license to use for training;
thumbnails pregenerated.

Timemachine clock: freeze or advance Sandbox time (±30 days) to simulate
quarterend, 1099 runs, and filing windows.

D\) Seeders & Scenario Packs (oneclick load)

Seeders (idempotent): Users, service profiles, portfolios, studios
(verified/unverified), RFPs, bookings/LBGs, messages, deliverables
manifests, reviews, disputes, deposits, chargebacks, promos.

Scenario packs (choose role, city, difficulty):

Support: "Late delivery & partial refund" --- deliverables shortfall,
acceptance window, amended receipt flow.

T&S: "Boundary violation report" --- autosuppress IB, strike ladder,
neutral review handoff.

Finance: "Processor outage wave" --- bulk partial refunds, recon
variances, payouts delay comms.

Tax: "State X nexus on" --- enable state, category map tweak, calc
exceptions, filing calendar dryrun.

Moderation: "NSFW spike" --- classifier thresholds, blur/crop UI,
appeals triage.

Studios: "Lockout at arrival" --- code logs, relocation list, deposit
void.

Promotions: "ROAS slumps" --- floors tuning, QS weights A/B, makegood
credits.

City Ops: "Coverage gap" --- invites cohort, Founding perks, carousel
pin, Collab Day.

Legal: "Subpoena intake" --- hold creation, discovery workspace,
redacted production pack.

E\) Simulators & Fakes (external dependencies)

Payments Processor Sim: card success/decline matrices, 3DS challenge
emulator, ACH microdeposit flow, payout states (queued/sent/fail),
chargebacks lifecycle with webhook playback.

Tax Engine Sim: city/state rate tables with toggles for timeouts/errors;
"zerowhereexpected" edge cases; efile stubs for 1099 runs.

ID/Background Sim: pass/fail with reason codes; throttling/bulk delays;
FCRA "adverse action" stub.

Content Scan Sim: NSFW classifier bands, OCR PII hits, virus flags.

Notifications Sim: email/SMS/web push sink with opens/clicks.

Maps/Geo Sim: distance & travel fee calculator; studio geocode
anomalies.

Social Metrics Sim: IG/TT/YT/X connectors return tokenized counts,
growth, and ratelimit errors.

Each simulator exposes: dashboard, force state switch, and replay last N
webhooks.

F\) Training Modes & Curricula

Role tracks: Support, T&S, Finance/Tax, City Ops, Studios Ops,
Moderation, Promotions/Ops, Legal.

Guided checklists inside the Admin UI: stepbystep tasks with
autovalidation ("Issue partial refund → amended receipt generated →
totals match calculator").

Inline coach marks & hint videos (60--120s) per task.

Autograding: pass/fail with explanations; require retry when policy
violated.

Certifications: "Sandbox Certified --- Support L1/L2", "T&S L1", etc.;
expire annually; printable PDF badges.

Practice datasets rotate monthly to prevent memorization.

G\) Incident Drills & Chaos Kits

Drill runner: schedule P0/P1 simulations (card processor outage, tax
engine down, promotions overspend).

Chaos toggles: inject latency, error spikes, partial dependency failures
(e.g., 20% payout API errors).

Scoring: MTTD/MTTR, correct use of degradations & runbooks, comms
timing, and adherence to guardrails (twoperson approvals).

Afteraction: autocompiled report; add action items to Observability
postmortem tracker (§4.14.13).

H\) QA & UAT Workflows (nocode)

Flag preview: flip §4.14.2 feature flags safely; simulate staged
rollouts and guardrail aborts.

Docs CMS UAT: assemble SOW/House Rules/releases; esign with fake
signers; pinned versions on fake bookings; PDF render checks.

Promotions UAT: CPC floors and QS weights simulations on a mirror of
last 7 days' synthetic queries.

Bulk Tools UAT: dryrun mass refunds, merges, and reindexes; verify
impact tiles and rollback templates.

Tax UAT: 1099 dryruns with edelivery consent flows; Efile stub returns
filing IDs.

Search & Ranking UAT: compare ranking diffs after rep formula/weight
changes on seeded data.

I\) Resets, Snapshots & Access Windows

Snapshot & restore: nightly baseline + manual snapshots preUAT; restore
in \<15 min.

Oneclick "clean room": wipe personal training footprints
(cases/messages) but keep seeds.

Access windows: training cohorts get timeboxed access; automatic disable
after window.

J\) Guardrails & Safety

Watermarks on every page; copy/paste of IDs adds "SANDBOX" suffix to
prevent misuse.

Downloads limited; CSVs watermarked; large exports blocked.

Money actions are virtual; Sandbox ledger kept separate; no external
funds ever move.

PII masks enforced; unmask buttons removed in Sandbox.

K\) Reporting & KPIs

Training completion rate by role/cohort; firstattempt pass %;
timetocertification.

Drill coverage: \# of drills/quarter; average MTTD/MTTR (Sandbox);
runbook adherence.

UAT throughput: \# of UAT sessions, issues found before Prod, rollback
rate reduction postUAT.

Simulator usage: webhooks replayed, failure modes exercised.

L\) Telemetry (Sandbox & Training)

sb.seed.run (pack) • sb.snapshot.create/restore

sb.simulator.state.set
(payments\|tax\|id\|content\|notify\|maps\|social)

M\) Acceptance Criteria (mark 4.14.16 FINAL)

Hardisolated Sandbox with environment banners, email/SMS sink, separate
RBAC/SSO.

Seeders & scenario packs covering Support, T&S, Finance/Tax, Moderation,
Studios, Promotions, City Ops, Legal.

Simulators for payments, tax, ID/background, content scan,
notifications, maps, social; webhook replay & forcestate.

Role curricula with guided checklists, autograding, and certifications.

Incident drills & chaos kit with scoring and afteraction reports.

QA/UAT flows for feature flags, docs CMS, promotions, bulk tools, tax,
and search---all without code.

Snapshots/resets; oneclick clean room; timeboxed training access.

Guardrails (no PII, no exports, no real money movement); watermarking
everywhere.

Reporting & telemetry for training, drills, simulators, and UAT.

N\) Why this works

Teams learn fast and safely on lifelike data.

Integrations behave realistically via simulators and webhooks---no
flakiness, no vendor risk.

Quality rises---UAT & drills catch misconfigs and process gaps before
they hit production.

Culture of readiness---regular drills, certifications, and audits keep
everyone sharp.

§5.0 --- Program Overview & Principles

Goal: Establish a clear, privacysafe, auditable data foundation that
powers ops dashboards, finance/tax accuracy, trust & safety, growth
analytics, and ML---while making schema evolution lowrisk and
predictable.

A\) Scope & Owners

Inscope: Event contracts, IDs & entity graph, ingestion pipelines,
warehouse layers (Bronze/Silver/Gold), metrics catalog & semantic layer,
privacy/PII/retention, dataquality, replays/backfills, lineage, ML
feature store, and cost/perf governance.

Primary owners:

Data Eng (pipelines, storage, contracts),

Analytics (metrics catalog, BI/semantic layer),

Privacy/Compliance (PII/retention/access),

Finance Ops (recon & monthend accuracy),

Product/Obs (event coverage, telemetry).

B\) Design Tenets

Contracts first: Every feature emits versioned events; changes are
additive; breaking changes require new names.

LBGaware by design: The Linked Booking Group is a firstclass key; legs
(Talent, Studio) roll up cleanly.

Bronze → Silver → Gold: Raw immutable logs → clean typed models →
businessready facts/dims.

Privacy by default: PII masked at rest; sensitive tables in restricted
schemas with RBAC scopes (per §4.14.1/§4.14.15).

Dual freshness: Sub15minute ops freshness; dayaccurate finance close
each morning.

Single source of truth: All dashboards pull from a Metrics Catalog with
versioned definitions.

Replays are normal: Idempotent loads and event replays make
audits/backfills safe.

Costaware: Partition by date/city/role, columnar storage, lifecycle
policies, and materialized views for heavy tiles.

C\) What Section 5 Will Deliver (roadmap)

§5.1 Event contract & naming (envelope, namespaces, required fields,
versions).

§5.2 Canonical IDs & entity graph (LBG/leg joins, referential rules).

§5.3 Ingest & pipelines (stream for ops, batch for finance).

§5.4 Warehouse layers & privacy zones.

§5.5 Gold schemas (facts & dims for search, bookings, finance, promos,
tax, T&S, studios).

§5.6 Metrics catalog & semantic layer (ties to §4.14.12).

§5.7 Privacy, PII & retention policies (USfirst).

§5.8 Data quality & testing (schema, invariants, reconciliation).

§5.9 Backfills & replays (tooling + runbooks).

§5.10 External systems & lineage (origin → transforms → dashboards).

§5.11 ML feature store & modeling hooks (ranking, risk, Smart Invites).

§5.12 Cost, performance & governance (SLAs, quotas, deprecation).

D\) Success Metrics & SLAs

Freshness: Ops Silver tables ≤ 15 min; Finance Gold closed by 06:00
local daily.

Reliability: Event loss = 0 (idempotent loads); pipeline success ≥ 99.9%
daily.

Data quality: Finance recon variance \< 0.5%; schema DQ failures \< 0.1%
runs.

Governance: 100% dashboard tiles reference a catalog key@version;
PIIrestricted access logged 100%.

Performance: BI p95 query \< 5s for core tiles; warehouse cost within
monthly budget (tracked).

E\) Change Management & Governance

PR checklist: includes event diffs & metric impact note.

Schema registry: semver + backwardcompatible evolution checks in CI.

Metric versioning: deprecation windows, with "what changed" diffs.

Access control: RBAC scopes (PIIBasic/PIISensitive/PIITax/Background);
masked downloads; watermarked exports.

Retention: nightly purge engine honors legal holds (from §4.14.15).

F\) Risks & Mitigations

Metric drift → enforce catalog & semantic layer; block adhoc SQL in
critical dashboards.

PII exposure → separate schemas + masking + access ledger.

Cost spikes → partitioning, TTL on Bronze, and scheduled
materializations.

Vendor outages → replayable ingest, DLQs, deterministic rebuilds.

G\) Acceptance Criteria (mark §5.0 FINAL)

Principles and scope approved by Data Eng, Analytics, Privacy.

Subsections enumerated with owners assigned.

CI checks for event/schema changes in place ("contracts first").

SLAs & success metrics recorded in Ops runbook and §4.14.12 dashboards.

H\) Why this works

This aligns product, ops, finance, and compliance on one consistent data
language. It preserves velocity (additive contracts, replays) while
keeping privacy and cost under control.

§5.1 --- Event Contract & Naming

Goal: Define a stable, privacysafe event contract so every feature
(Sections 1--4) emits versioned, auditable events that downstream
systems can trust. Contracts are additive, LBGaware, and enforce
consistent types for time, money, IDs, and PII.

A\) Event Envelope (required on every event)

All producers (web, mobile, services, admin) must include this envelope.
Fields are snake_case, UTC timestamps in ISO8601.

{

\"event_id\": \"c3e82a8b-2a1f-4e6a-9bf7-7c9b2b7e0d1a\",

\"event_name\": \"booking.request\",

\"event_version\": \"1.0.0\",

\"occurred_at\": \"2025-11-04T19:22:11Z\",

\"received_at\": \"2025-11-04T19:22:12Z\",

\"actor_user_id\": \"usr_6c2bd1c9\",

\"actor_role\": \"buyer\", // enum:
buyer\|model\|photographer\|videographer\|creator\|studio_host\|admin\|system

\"lbg_id\": \"lbg_01HE9Z7A5S\", // nullable

\"booking_leg_id\": \"leg_01HE9Z8R3C\", // nullable

\"leg_role\": \"talent\", // enum: talent\|studio\|null

\"city_id\": \"city_houston\",

\"state\": \"TX\",

\"country\": \"US\",

\"platform\": \"web\", // enum: web\|ios\|android\|admin\|system

\"app_version\": \"1.3.2\", // nullable

\"session_id\": \"sess_b5f4b2c1\", // nullable

\"request_id\": \"req_7f5c93f4\", // trace/correlation

\"ip_hash\": \"ip_7f6d3b\", // irreversible hash

\"user_agent_hash\": \"ua_1b2c3d\", // irreversible hash

\"privacy_tier\": \"pii_basic\", // enum below

\"payload\": { /\* event-specific schema \*/ }

}

Notes & constraints

Monetary values in minor units (cents) as integers and ISO currency in
payload (e.g., \"currency\": \"USD\").

IDs are stable, opaque strings (see §5.2).

PII (email, phone, TIN, full address) must not appear in payloads; store
tokens/IDs and join in protected tables only.

occurred_at is when the action happened; received_at is ingestion time;
both required.

B\) Naming Rules

event_name is namespace.action in snake_case, e.g., search.query_run,
fin.checkout_pay_success.

Namespaces (toplevel):\
acct, search, profile, msg, booking, deliver, promo, fin, tax, studio,
sup, ts, cms, data, obs, bulk, legal.

Action verbs: run, click, open, send, read, request, accept, decline,
cancel, change_order, upload, accept, queue, sent, fail, charge, credit,
calc_request, calc_response, case_open, decision, publish, rollback,
start, finish.

No breaking renames. If semantics change incompatibly, mint a new
event_name.

C\) Versioning Policy (semver)

event_version = \"MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH\".

MINOR/PATCH: add optional fields, tighten enums with backwardcompatible
defaults.

MAJOR: breaking change → do not bump; create a new event_name (e.g.,
booking.request → booking.request_v2).

Producers must not drop required fields of an existing version.

D\) Types, Enums & Limits (global)

Time: ISO8601 UTC.

Money: integers in cents; currency code \"USD\" at launch.

Distance/geo: meters (int) or \"lat\",\"lon\" floats when needed.

Strings: max 1,024 chars unless noted; free text capped to 5,000.

Arrays: max 1,000 elements; item types defined per schema.

Enums (global):

actor_role:
buyer\|model\|photographer\|videographer\|creator\|studio_host\|admin\|system

leg_role: talent\|studio

platform: web\|ios\|android\|admin\|system

privacy_tier: public\|pii_basic\|pii_sensitive\|pii_tax\|pii_background

E\) Privacy Tiers (enforced at ingest)

public: no PII, safe for broad analytics.

pii_basic: indirect identifiers (user IDs, ip_hash, masked last4).

pii_sensitive: address fragments, DOB (never emitted in events---only
tokens permitted; use for joins if absolutely necessary).

pii_tax: W9/W8/1099 refs (IDs only).

pii_background: background check references (IDs only).

Rule: Raw PII values are forbidden in event payloads; only tokens/IDs
allowed.

G\) Producer Obligations

Emit at least the events listed above for the flows you implement.

Include the envelope fields, correct privacy_tier, and validated payload
per schema.

Idempotency: do not reemit the same event_id; retries must reuse the
event_id.

Ordering: preserve perentity ordering (e.g., for a given booking_leg_id)
when feasible.

H\) Schema Registry & CI

JSON Schemas (per event_name & event_version) live in the Schema
Registry; publishers fetch at build.

CI checks:

Validate all emitted test payloads against registry.

Block PRs that remove required fields or introduce forbidden PII.

Require a diff note describing metric impact for any event change (ties
to §5.6 catalog).

I\) Backward Compatibility & Deprecation

Add fields as optional first; only make required after a tworelease
grace period and consumer readiness.

For breaking semantics, mint a new event_name (e.g., \_v2) and run both
for one release cycle, then deprecate older.

The Registry marks deprecated with an EOL date; ingestion continues but
dashboards switch based on the catalog version.

Envelope and required fields implemented by all producers (web, mobile,
services, admin).

Naming & semver rules enforced; namespaces aligned with product modules.

Privacy tiers validated; ingestion blocks forbidden PII.

JSON Schemas for the 12 core families published to the Registry with
examples.

CI gating for schema validation & "no breaking changes without new
name."

Sample payloads validated endtoend into Bronze; test tables show
expected rows.

K\) Why this works

Stable for consumers (dashboards, finance, ML) because producers evolve
additively.

Auditable because every event has consistent IDs, timestamps, and
privacy classification.

Search/LBG aware so key marketplace concepts roll up cleanly.

Lowrisk evolution via schema registry + CI and clear deprecation paths.

§5.2 --- Canonical IDs & Entity Graph

Goal: Define stable, opaque IDs and a precise entity graph so bookings,
payments, messaging, docs, studios, promotions, tax, and safety all join
cleanly. Prevent double counting, enable LBG (Linked Booking Group)
rollups, and support merges, soft deletions, and audits without code
rewrites.

A\) Scope & Design Goals

One source of truth for IDs, relationships, and cardinalities across
Sections 1--4.

Opaque, nonguessable IDs (no PII embedded).

LBGaware joins: legs (Talent, Studio) roll up to an LBG where
applicable.

No hard deletes on principals (users, bookings, studios): use soft
delete / tombstones and legal holds (see §4.14.15).

Compatible with §5.1 events and §4.14.x admin ops (bulk tools, disputes,
finance, tax, studios).

B\) ID Strategy (format, creation, safety)

Format: 26char ULID/UUIDv7style opaque strings, URLsafe, lowercase,
prefixed for readability.\
Generation: Serverside only; idempotent creators accept client retries
without duplicating (caller supplies a natural key or request id).\
Environment: IDs are environmentscoped (never move between
Sandbox/Prod).\
PII: IDs never encode emails, names, or locations.

Example: usr_01HE9Z7A5S6E3Z1B8QK3J8N3QX (prefix + ULID body)

C\) Canonical ID Catalog (v1)

Rule: Reviews, pricing, availability, and search exposure are tied to
service_profile_id, not user_id---this keeps multirole users clean.

D\) Entity Graph & Cardinalities (core)

Users & Profiles

user_id 1---M service_profile_id (one per role; can be multiple of the
same role if needed later---v1 uses one)

user_id 1---M studio_id (host can own several studios)

Bookings

lbg_id 1---M booking_leg_id (0 or many legs; singleleg bookings have an
LBG too for uniformity)

Each booking_leg_id belongs to exactly one service_profile_id (provider)
and one buyer user_id

booking_leg_id 1---M doc_id (SOW, Releases, Change Orders)

Messaging

message_thread_id belongs to a booking_leg_id or lbg_id (group thread);
messages reference the thread

Reviews & References

review_id belongs to booking_leg_id (source of truth) and attaches to
service_profile_id

reference_id belongs to a user_id pair; optional artifact asset_id or
external link

Payments

charge_id belongs to lbg_id (group checkout) and references each
booking_leg_id in line items

refund_id belongs to charge_id; may reference specific leg lines

payout_id belongs to user_id (seller) and aggregates multiple
booking_leg_id settlements

deposit_id belongs to a studio leg (booking_leg_id with leg_role=studio)

Promotions

promotion_campaign_id belongs to a service_profile_id; click charges
link to the campaign and the viewer (hashed)

Safety/Support

ts_case_id and support_case_id reference whichever scope applies:
user_id, service_profile_id, booking_leg_id, or lbg_id

Tax/Compliance

w9_id belongs to user_id (payee), not profile; form1099_id belongs to
user_id per tax year

tax_calc_id belongs to lbg_id at checkout time

E\) Key Lifecycles (state machines)

Service Profile: draft → published → paused → banned (T&S) → deleted
(soft)\
Booking Leg: requested → accepted → in_progress → delivered → completed
→ (optional) disputed → resolved\
LBG: created → paid → all legs completed → closed\
Studio: onboarding → verified → reverify_due → suspended\
Promotion Campaign: active → paused → completed → archived\
Payout: queued → sent → failed (retryable) → settled\
Deposit: authorized → captured/voided → released (or retained by claim)

State changes emit §5.1 events (e.g., booking.accept, fin.payout.sent,
studio.verify.approve).

F\) Referential Integrity & Cascades

No hard deletes for: users, profiles, studios, legs, LBGs, charges,
payouts, docs. Use deleted_at (soft) or legal hold flags.

Cascade rules (logical, via jobs):

User merge (see §4.14.14): reparent all child records to the canonical
user_id; service_profile_ids either merge (same role) or remain distinct
(multibrand).

Profile delete (soft): remove from search; keep bookings/reviews intact
(historical).

Studio delete (soft): pause new bookings; preserve history; deposits
must be closed.

Foreign keys enforced in Silver/Gold models; Bronze is eventappendonly.

G\) MultiRole Modeling (why profiles matter)

Search & pricing live on service_profile_id, keeping criteria clean per
role (model vs photographer vs videographer vs creator).

Reviews and Rep Score compute per profile, then roll up to userlevel
(display both on profile).

Messaging is per booking; inbox groups threads by role ("Model Inbox",
"Photographer Inbox") for clarity.

H\) LBG Semantics (grouping multiple legs)

An LBG ties multiple legs (e.g., Talent + Studio) so the buyer can check
out once and receive a Group Receipt (see §4.12).

Cancel/Dispute is legscoped; the other leg remains intact. Group status
reflects all legs.

Payments: one charge_id at checkout linked to lbg_id, lineitems to each
booking_leg_id.

Receipts & Docs: each leg has its own SOW/Release; group receipt links
both.

I\) Indexing & Partition Hints (warehouse view)

Facts partitioned by dt and clustered by city_id, role, lbg_id or
booking_leg_id (per table).

Dim tables (SCD2) use valid_from/valid_to and natural keys
(service_profile_id, city_id).

Unique constraints:

review_id unique per booking_leg_id per reviewer.

promotion_campaign_id unique per service_profile_id per time window.

One active w9_id per payee user_id.

Join paths used by BI are fixed in §5.5 (star schema).

J\) Examples (how things join)

Example 1 --- Provider earnings for a week

fact_payout (Gold) → filter sent_at between dates & user_id = provider.

Drill into payout breakdown table → join booking_leg_id lines → join
dim_service_profile to show role and city.

Sum net cents; show legs & group them by lbg_id if needed.

Example 2 --- Reviews & Rep for a photographer

Get service_profile_id where role=photographer for user_id.

Join fact_booking_leg (completed legs) → review_id and ratings.

Compute profile Rep Score (timeweighted); separately compute user Rep
from all profiles.

Example 3 --- Group receipt

lbg_id → list legs in fact_booking_leg.

For each leg: join doc_id for SOW/Release, join fact_payment line items;
union to build group totals.

K\) Validation Rules (loadtime checks)

A booking_leg_id must have: buyer user_id, provider service_profile_id,
city_id, start_at \< end_at, and one state at a time.

A charge_id linked to an lbg_id must reconcile to the sum of included
leg lines ± buyer fee/tax.

A review_id must reference a completed leg and match the buyer on that
leg.

A deposit_id must reference a studio leg.

A form1099_id must map to an eligible payee and the sum of payouts for
that tax year.

L\) Acceptance Criteria (mark §5.2 FINAL)

ID catalog (names, prefixes, examples) published and used consistently
by all services & events.

Entity graph documented with cardinalities; enforced via Silver/Gold FK
tests.

LBG semantics implemented: legs roll up, payments group at checkout,
receipts/doc links per leg + group.

Multirole separation: search/reviews/rep attached to service_profile_id;
rollup to user shown in UI.

Lifecycle states defined for key entities; state transitions emit §5.1
events.

Softdelete and legal hold patterns applied; no cascaded hard deletes.

Validation rules in pipeline block malformed joins; data quality tests
green.

Warehouse hints (partitioning/clustering) documented and followed in
§5.5 schemas.

M\) Why this works

Keeps multirole users sane (clean, rolespecific search and reviews)
while preserving a single account.

Group bookings (LBG) capture realworld flows (talent + studio) without
muddying payments or disputes.

Opaque, wellscoped IDs plus soft deletion and legal holds make audits
and merges safe.

Analysts, Finance, T&S, and Ops all get consistent joins---no double
counts, no missing links.

§5.3 --- Ingest & Pipelines (Stream/Batch)

Goal: Move events from clients/services to analyticsready tables with
\<15minute freshness for ops and dayaccurate finance---safely, cheaply,
and replayably. Enforce contracts from §5.1, IDs from §5.2, privacy
gates, and exactlyonce semantics at sinks.

A\) Architecture at a Glance

Producers (web/mobile/services/admin) → Edge Collector (HTTP/gRPC) →
Event Bus (ordered, durable) →\
Bronze landing (appendonly, validated, partitioned) → Silver streaming
transforms (typed, PIImasked, enriched + CDC) →\
Gold batch close (daily finance/tax facts; reconciled) → BI/ML/alerts.

Control planes: Schema Registry (contracts), Feature Flags (rates,
sampling), DLQ/Quarantine UI, Replay tool, Data Quality monitors.

B\) Edge Collection (client/sdk rules)

Envelope required (per §5.1). SDKs batch events, gzip, and send over
TLS; retriable with exponential backoff.

Size limits: payload ≤ 64 KB; batch ≤ 512 KB; queue cap per device to
avoid memory blowups.

Clock skew: include device time; collector normalizes to UTC and adds
received_at.

PII filter at edge: reject events that contain forbidden fields (email,
phone, TIN, full address, PAN), return 4xx to SDK with reason; do not
store.

Sampling: off by default; can enable for highvolume impression events
later (never for money/safety).

Auth: producer token (rotated); admin events require mTLS and role
claim.

Idempotency: SDK must reuse the same event_id on retry; collector dedups
per event_id for a short window.

C\) Event Bus (topics, keys, ordering)

Topics by domain (mirror namespaces): search, msg, booking, deliver,
fin, promo, tax, studio, sup, ts, cms, obs, bulk, legal.

Partition key defaults:

booking, deliver, fin: booking_leg_id (preserves perleg order).

lbgscoped payments/tax: lbg_id.

msg: message_thread_id.

profile/search/promo: service_profile_id.

Fallback to actor_user_id if others null.

Ordering guarantees: within a key/partition. Processors must handle late
arrivals; don't assume global order.

D\) Bronze Landing (appendonly, validated)

Store immutable events as columnar files (e.g., Parquet) partitioned by
dt = occurred_at::date and event_name.

Schema validation: every record validated against Schema Registry; add
validation_status (ok\|warn\|fail).

Dedup: unique on event_id; keep the first arrival (subsequent duplicates
to bronze.dedup_skipped).

Privacy tagging: persist privacy_tier; events with forbidden PII never
land (blocked at edge).

DLQs / Quarantine families:

schema_violation (unknown name/version, wrong types),

oversize (exceeds limits),

unknown_actor (missing/invalid ID),

contract_break (required field missing),

poison_pill (processor crash repro sample).

Lineage stamps: ingest_id, collector_id, bus_offset.

E\) Silver Transforms (streaming; \<15min SLA)

Engines: streaming jobs (tooling TBD in tech plan) consume bus → write
typed, partitioned Silver tables.

Common transforms

Flatten payload into typed columns; enforce enums; discard extra fields
into payload_extra (for forwardcompat).

Enrich with dimensions: dim_city, dim_service_profile, dim_user (CDC
feeds below).

PII masking: keep only hashed tokens; no raw PII fields.

Watermarks & lateness: allow 10--30 min eventtime lateness; recompute
small windows to capture stragglers.

Exactlyonce sinks: use merge/upsert on natural keys (e.g., event_id, or
(charge_id,leg_id,line_no) for facts).

Stateful joins (where needed): e.g., correlate fin.checkout_pay\_\* with
booking.request for sanity checks.

Silver tables (illustrative)

silver.events_search (query, filters, results_count, promoted flag)

silver.events_msg (thread/message actions)

silver.booking_events (request/accept/decline/cancel/change_order with
deltas)

silver.deliver_events (uploads, accepts, revision requests)

silver.fin_events (charges, refunds, payouts, deposits)

silver.promo_events (clicks valid/invalid, featured starts)

silver.tax_events (calc req/resp, 1099 delivery)

silver.ts_events / silver.support_events

silver.studio_events (verify, deposit lifecycle)

silver.docs_events (sow/release/change orders)

CDC feeds (reference dims)

From transactional DB to Silver: silver.dim_user_cdc,
silver.dim_service_profile_cdc, silver.dim_studio_cdc,
silver.dim_policy_cdc.

Built with SCD2 patterns (valid_from/to); merged nightly into Gold dims.

Data Quality guards (inline)

Reject impossible money math (negative totals); push to quarantine;
raise S2 alert (§4.14.13).

Check ID referential existence within a lookback window; missing dims
flagged.

F\) Gold Finance Close (daily batch; dayaccurate)

A deterministic batch (cron after local midnight) computes reconciled
finance/tax facts and other heavy facts:

Assemble leg lines from silver.fin_events and silver.booking_events.

Compute net lines: provider fee, buyer fee, discounts, taxes, processor
fees, reserves, early payout fees.

Reconcile against processor settlements (settlement feed) and deposit
captures; write variances.

Finalize facts: fact_payment, fact_payout, fact_tax, fact_deposit,
fact_lbg, fact_booking_leg (see §5.5).

Lock window (idempotent): reruns overwrite same day with same results;
variances tracked.

Emit DQ & recon reports to Finance dashboard (§4.14.12 D9).

SLA: Gold finance complete by 06:00 local daily; retries autoescalate to
SRE/Finance on failure.

G\) Replays, Backfills & Corrections

Event Replay Tool: select event_name, date range, optional IDs →
republish to bus with replayed_at and original occurred_at; Bronze dedup
uses event_id, so replays in Bronze are separate (replay=true) and flow
through Silver with merge keys to update rows.

Gold recompute: partitioned by dt; rerun only affected days (and
dependent windows).

Contract evolution: new fields flow through Silver with payload_extra
until consumers adopt; no breaking changes.

Audit trail: replays recorded in data.replay logs (who/why/range) and
visible in §4.14.12 Data QA.

H\) Performance, Scaling & Cost

Microbatch streaming intervals: 1--2 min; watermark 10--30 min; tune per
topic.

File sizes: Parquet 128--256 MB target; compaction jobs to coalesce
small files.

Partitioning: by dt; cluster by city_id, role, and lbg_id/booking_leg_id
where appropriate.

TTL: Bronze raw retained 90 days (configurable; see §5.12); Silver
retained per policy; Gold retained per retention (§4.14.15).

Hot paths: materialize BI views for heavy tiles (search CTR, promotions
ROAS).

I\) Reliability & Failure Modes (with playbooks)

Bus outage/backlog → backpressure; raise S1; autoscale consumers;
catchup metrics (lag minutes) on cockpit (§4.14.13).

Bronze write failures → circuit break to local spool; alarm; drain when
store healthy.

Schema drift → events to schema_violation DLQ; alert Data Eng; hotfix in
Schema Registry.

Downstream warehouse outage → buffer in object store; resume; mark
dashboards "partial" via freshness badges (§4.14.12).

Poison pill → capture sample to DLQ; sandbox reprocess; issue patch;
replay.

J\) Security & Compliance

Transport: TLS everywhere; admin producers require mTLS.

AuthZ: producer tokens bound to namespaces; ratelimits per token.

At rest: serverside encryption; restricted IAM per bucket/prefix.

Privacy: no raw PII beyond masked tokens in events; privacy_tier
enforced; sensitive tables isolated (see §5.7).

Access: Bronze is restricted; most users consume from Gold/Silver views
via RBAC.

K\) Telemetry (pipeline & health events)

Emit ops events (consumed by §4.14.12/§4.14.13 dashboards):

data.ingest.accept/deny (reason) • data.bus.lag_minutes •
data.bronze.write.ok/fail

data.silver.job.late_events (count, max_lateness) •
data.silver.upsert.errors

data.gold.close.start/finish/fail • data.recon.variance (amount_cents)

data.dlq.enqueue/resolve (family) • data.replay.start/finish

Freshness gauges per table.

L\) Acceptance Criteria (mark §5.3 FINAL)

Edge Collector enforces contracts, size limits, PII filter, auth,
idempotent retries.

Event Bus topics & keys set; perentity ordering preserved; backpressure
metrics visible.

Bronze landing: validated, deduped by event_id, partitioned, with DLQ
families and lineage stamps.

Silver streaming: typed tables, enrich joins, PII masked, watermarks for
late data, exactlyonce upserts.

CDC for dims available; SCD2 merge pattern in place.

Gold daily close builds finance/tax facts; reconciled to settlements;
SLA 06:00 local.

Replay/backfill tooling works; audit logs for replays; partitioned
recompute only.

Performance/cost controls (compaction, partitioning, TTL) configured;
freshness \<15 min for ops tables.

Security/RBAC applied; Bronze restricted; telemetry & DQ alerts wire to
Observability.

M\) Why this works

Opsfast, financetrue: streaming for freshness, batch for reconciliation.

Safe evolution: schema registry + additive contracts + quarantine
protect consumers.

Resilient & auditable: DLQs, replays, lineage stamps, and recon reports
keep trust high.

Costaware & scalable: partitioning, compaction, TTLs, and clustered
layouts limit warehouse spend

§5.4 --- Warehouse Layers & Privacy Zones

Goal: Make analytics fast and trustworthy without risking PII. Separate
raw logs from curated business tables, isolate sensitive fields in a
vault, and give each team the right layer with RBAC, masking, and
retention builtin. Be LBGaware (Linked Booking Group) so legs roll up
cleanly.

A\) Layers at a Glance (what each is for)

Rule: Dashboards in §4.14.12 read Gold/Gold_Restricted only. Silver is
for pipelines & ML feature building; Bronze is never used for BI.

B\) Physical Layout & Naming

Schemas / databases

bronze.\* (e.g., bronze.events_booking\_\_2025_11)

silver.\* (e.g., silver.booking_events, silver.dim_user_cdc)

gold.\* (e.g., gold.fact_booking_leg, gold.dim_service_profile)

gold_restricted.\* (masked views over gold.\*)

vault_pii.\* (e.g., vault_pii.user_contact, vault_pii.tax_forms)

gov.\* (catalog, lineage, dataquality, metric catalog, retention
ledgers)

Table naming rules

Events by domain in Silver: silver.\<domain\>\_events (e.g.,
silver.fin_events)

Facts/Dims in Gold: gold.fact\_\<subject\>, gold.dim\_\<entity\>

Materialized rollups: gold.mv\_\<subject\>\_\_\<grain\> (e.g.,
gold.mv_search_ctr\_\_day_city_role)

All Gold facts include lbg_id and/or booking_leg_id to support LBG
rollups.

C\) Privacy Zones & RBAC (who can see what)

Zones

Public/Operational (default): no raw PII; masked tokens only.

Restricted: masked PII view with limited unmaskability (percolumn,
perrole).

Sensitive: tax/background artifacts; accessible to Legal/Tax only with
twoperson approval (per §4.14.1 & §4.14.15).

Access groups (examples)

Finance → gold (all facts), gold_restricted (masked buyer emails), no
vault_pii (except recon contact via JustInTime elevation).

Trust & Safety → gold_restricted, selective Sensitive views for case
evidence via JIT.

Analytics/City Ops/Marketing → gold_restricted only.

Legal/Tax → vault_pii + Sensitive forms; downloads watermarked;
dualapproval to unmask.

Rowlevel security (RLS)

Optional city scoping for contractors: RLS filters rows by city_id.

Dynamic masking

Email/phone shown as j\*\*\*@example.com, (\*\*\*) \*\*\*1234 unless
unmasked by scope & reason.

D\) PII Strategy (tokens, vault, masking)

Tokenization at ingest: Emails/phones hashed/tokenized; only tokens flow
to Bronze/Silver/Gold.

Vault_PII holds minimal reversible mappings: user_id, token, encrypted
value (KMS), last4, verification flags, timestamps.

Unmask flow: Admin JIT elevation (reason + ticket) → scoped SQL function
→ audited view for a limited window; export watermarking enforced.

Never in events: SSNs/TINs, full card PANs, full addresses are not in
§5.1 payloads; W9/1099 PDFs live in vault_pii.tax_forms with access
gates.

E\) Retention & Lifecycle (cost + compliance)

Bronze: retain 90 days, then archive to cold storage; legal holds pause
deletes.

Silver: retain 12--24 months for ops analyses; compact monthly; purge
per retention schedule (§4.14.15).

Gold: retain per record class---finance/tax 7 years, T&S 5 years,
support 2--3 years, generic product facts 24 months;
softdelete/tombstone handled in dims.

Vault_PII: retain per legal policy (tax 7 years); deletion honored for
DSR where lawful (keep financial minimums).

Purge ledger in gov.retention_log writes counts, IDs (masked), policy
reason, and job run.

F\) Partitioning, Clustering & Indexing

Partition large facts by dt (UTC date), cluster by city_id, role, and
lbg_id/booking_leg_id.

Dims (SCD2): cluster by entity id; use valid_from/valid_to with current
row flags.

Search facts: cluster by role, city_id, query_hash.

Promotions: cluster by service_profile_id, city_id.

Tax & payouts: cluster by state, city_id, user_id for SLA queries.

G\) Gold Contract (what every fact must include)

Required columns in every fact\_\*:

dt (date), city_id, role (where applicable), lbg_id and/or
booking_leg_id, user_id (owner of the record, e.g., provider for
payouts), created_at, updated_at.

Money columns are integers in cents + currency (USD).

LBG vs leg flags: is_group_rollup (bool) or separate tables (see §5.5).

Source stamp: bronze_offset, event_version_hash.

Softdelete flag for rebuilds and backfills.

Dim contracts (dim\_\*):

Surrogate key, natural key (e.g., service_profile_id), SCD2 columns,
current_flag, deleted_at (nullable).

H\) Materializations & Performance

Materialized views for hot tiles in §4.14.12 (e.g., marketplace KPIs,
ROAS, search CTR).

Incremental refresh cadence: hourly for ops, daily for finance.

Compaction jobs coalesce small files into 128--256 MB targets.

Query guards: perteam slots/quotas; kill long scans; hints to always use
partition filters.

Cost dashboards (per §5.12) track spend by schema/table and top queries.

I\) Catalog, Lineage & Quality Annotations

Data Catalog (gov.catalog): table owner, freshness SLA, privacy zone,
retention policy, business description, and metric keys used (links to
§4.14.12).

Lineage: each Gold table lists upstream Silver/Bronze sources; BI tiles
show lineage links.

Quality badges: Red/Amber/Green derived from DQ monitors (see §5.8);
tiles hide or show warnings accordingly.

J\) Developer & Analyst Interfaces

Analysts: query gold_restricted.\* through the semantic layer (metrics
catalog in §5.6); no adhoc joins to vault or Bronze.

Data Science: sample from Silver snapshots for model training; feature
store pulls from Gold (see §5.11).

Finance: read Gold finance snapshots (locked daily); recon exports
scheduled to Finance dashboard.

Legal/Tax: governed access to vault_pii.\* with export watermarking &
chainofcustody logs.

K\) Security, Keys & Audits

Encryption at rest with KMS; key rotation per policy.

Grant model: least privilege; role → schema/table permissions;
columnlevel masks where needed.

All downloads watermarked (user, timestamp, query hash); exports logged
in gov.export_log.

DLP scans nightly for forbidden patterns in nonvault schemas; alert if
found (block on repeat).

L\) Acceptance Criteria (mark §5.4 FINAL)

Schemas created: bronze, silver, gold, gold_restricted (masked views),
vault_pii, gov.

RBAC & masking policies enforced per zone; RLS optional by city; JIT
unmask with audit logs live.

Retention policies configured per layer; purge engine writes to
gov.retention_log; legal holds pause deletes.

Partitioning/clustering set per table family; compaction jobs scheduled;
performance quotas active.

Gold facts/dims conform to contracts (money in cents, LBG/leg keys,
source stamps); SCD2 dims in place.

Catalog metadata populated (owner, SLA, privacy, retention); lineage
links from Gold → Silver/Bronze.

DLP scans & export watermarking active; downloads audited; keys rotated.

Cost dashboards running; freshness SLAs (\<15 min ops; daily finance
close) visible in §4.14.12.

M\) Why this works

Fast for teams, safe for users: Gold is readytouse and masked; sensitive
data is quarantined to the vault with tight gates.

Auditable: Bronze stays immutable; lineage and contracts make every
number explainable.

Scalable & costaware: Partitioning, compaction, and materializations
keep queries snappy and bills predictable.

LBGaware: Facts carry group and leg keys, so talent and studio flows tie
together cleanly.

§5.5 --- Gold Schemas (Facts & Dimensions)

Goal: Define the businessready tables analysts, Finance, Ops, and
Product will use---clean keys, LBGaware rollups, money in cents, SCD2
dimensions, and predictable joins. All tables conform to §5.4 contracts
and IDs from §5.2.

A\) Modeling rules (apply to every Gold table)

Keys: Use opaque IDs from §5.2; every fact includes dt (UTC date),
city_id, and at least one of lbg_id or booking_leg_id.

Money: Integers in cents + currency=\'USD\'. Totals reconcile to §5.3
Gold finance close.

PII: No raw PII; joins to masked dims only (see gold_restricted).

G\) Acceptance Criteria (mark §5.5 FINAL)

Dims created with SCD2 (dim_user, dim_service_profile, dim_studio,
dim_city, dim_policy, dim_promotion_campaign, dim_doc_template).

Facts created with grains & columns as above (fact_lbg,
fact_booking_leg, fact_payment + fact_payment_line, fact_payout +
fact_payout_leg, fact_deposit, fact_tax, fact_promo, fact_search,
fact_thread_activity, fact_support_case, fact_ts_case, fact_docs,
fact_social_snapshot).

Partitioning/clustering follow §5.4; money in cents; timestamps
consistent.

Allocation math implemented & reconciles to §5.3 finance close; DQ tests
green.

Semantic layer (next §5.6) maps these tables to curated
measures/dimensions; catalog entries created for each measure.

H\) Why this works

Clean grains and keys make queries fast and predictable.

LBG vs leg separation reflects real workflows (talent + studio) without
double counting.

SCD2 dims capture profile/policy changes historically for fair
analytics.

The set covers marketplace health, money, trust/safety, promotions, and
social in one consistent model.

§5.6 --- Metrics Catalog & Semantic Layer

Goal: Give every team one consistent, audited set of metrics---with
clear, versioned definitions; safe, LBGaware rollups; and a semantic
layer that prevents double counting and "SQL drift." Dashboards, alerts,
experiments, and ML features all read from this layer.

A\) What this delivers

A versioned Metrics Catalog (YAML/JSON) where each metric has: key,
owner, business definition, SQL logic path, grain, allowed dimensions,
filters, privacy tier, and test suite.

A semantic layer (views/API) that enforces correct joins and grains
(e.g., LBG vs leg), exposes curated measures/dimensions, and blocks
unsafe combinations.

Change safety: Metric semver, deprecation windows, and "definition hash"
tags on dashboards (matches §4.14.12).

B\) Modeling rules (global)

Grain first: Every metric declares its base grain (e.g., leg, LBG,
campaignday). Aggregations always respect that grain.

LBGaware: Leglevel money (provider earnings, payouts) uses
fact_booking_leg; grouplevel money (checkout totals) uses
fact_lbg/fact_payment.

Money in cents: All \$ in cents; semantic layer exposes both \*\_cents
and formatted USD.

Ratios: Always recompute as Σ numerator / Σ denominator at query time
(never average of ratios).

Attribution transparency: Promotions metrics report both "direct" and
"incremental (holdoutestimated)" values.

Defaults: Time grain = day, currency = USD, Safe Mode (SFW) on when
applicable.

C\) Core business definitions (v1)

These are the canonical definitions the catalog will encode.

GMV (Gross Merchandise Value) --- buyer spend on services excluding
buyer fee, taxes, and studio deposits.\
Formula (LBG grain):\
gmv_cents = subtotal_cents + addons_total_cents + travel_total_cents +
license_total_cents from gold.fact_lbg.\
Notes: deposits are not GMV; refunds tracked separately.

Platform Revenue (Bookings) --- provider fee + buyer fee (before
processor costs).\
Formula: provider_fee_cents + buyer_fee_cents allocated from
gold.fact_payment into gold.fact_booking_leg then summed.\
Variant: Net Booking Revenue = Platform Revenue − processor fees −
invalidclick credits (bookingrelated, if any).

Take Rate (%) --- platform_revenue / GMV.\
Variants: bookingonly vs. all (booking + promotions + early payout
fees).

Bookings --- count of completed legs (status completed).\
Where: gold.fact_booking_leg.

Cancellations (rate) --- cancels ÷ requests at leg grain; split by
buyerinitiated vs providerinitiated; policy band segments.\
Where: gold.fact_booking_leg (status=\'canceled\' and
policy_band_on_cancel).

Acceptance Rate --- accepts ÷ (accepts + declines) for provider;
rolespecific; controlled for Instant Book.\
Where: gold.fact_booking_leg events rollup (or derived from booking
status transitions).

Search→Inquiry Conversion --- inquiries opened ÷ search result clicks
(same role/city/day).\
Where: gold.fact_search + messaging opens leading to a thread
(msg.thread_open).

Inquiry→Booking Conversion --- booking requests ÷ inquiries
(threadlinked).\
Where: gold.fact_thread_activity + gold.fact_booking_leg.

Ontime Delivery Rate --- legs that hit deliverables window ÷ completed
legs.\
Where: gold.fact_booking_leg (accepted_at ≤ due_at derived).

Safety Report Rate --- T&S cases per 1,000 completed legs; severity
buckets.\
Where: gold.fact_ts_case + gold.fact_booking_leg.

Payout Latency --- median days from completed_at → payout_sent_at.\
Where: gold.fact_booking_leg + gold.fact_payout_leg.

Promotions Spend (Boost/Featured) --- CPC clicks valid (Boost) + weekly
fees (Featured).\
Where: gold.fact_promo.

CPB (Cost per Booking) --- promo_spend / attributed_bookings.\
Incremental CPB: promo_spend / incremental_bookings via holdout.

ROAS --- gmv_attributed / promo_spend; Incremental ROAS uses
gmv_incremental_cents.

Rep Decile Share --- distribution of bookings by provider Rep Score
decile.\
Where: join gold.fact_booking_leg →
gold.dim_service_profile.rep_score_role.

Tax Collected --- Σ tax_cents from gold.fact_tax (jurisdiction
breakdowns).

Notes: The actual implementation can live in a metrics framework; YAML
shown for clarity.

E\) Semantic layer (views/API) --- how it protects us

Conformed dimensions: Expose a single dim_time (day/week/month),
dim_city, dim_role, dim_service_profile, dim_campaign so all metrics
"slice" the same way.

Guardrails:

LBG vs leg: The layer blocks queries that mix LBGgrain money (GMV) with
leggrain fields without a safe join path; it proposes an allowed rollup
(e.g., aggregate legs first).

Attribution filters: Promotions metrics require promotion_campaign_id or
type; you can't ask for ROAS without a campaign context.

Privacy: Queries that try to expose PII columns from vault are denied;
only masked views are available (gold_restricted).

Ratios: When you add dimensions, the semantic layer recomputes ratios
properly (numerator/denominator recomputed at the new grain).

APIs:

/metrics/query accepts: metric keys, time grain, allowed
dimensions/filters, and returns typed series with definition_hash and
catalog_version.

/metrics/inspect returns the SQL and upstream lineage for any metric
key@version.

F\) Tests & data quality (per metric)

Definition tests: Nonnegative money, denominators not zero,
reconciliation to settlements for finance metrics.

Drift tests: Compare latest week vs prior week distribution; alert on
large swings (beyond set thresholds).

Freshness: Every metric key declares its expected freshness (ops ≤15
min; finance daily 06:00). Dashboards show a freshness badge.

G\) Versioning & change management

Semver per metric: gmv_cents@1.0.0 → add fields or improve logic →
1.1.0. Breaking definition changes → new key (e.g.,
gmv_cents_excl_travel@1.0.0).

Deprecation: Dashboards show "this tile uses v1.0.0; v1.1.0 available."
Migration windows and change notes documented.

Owner required: Each metric has an owner team; CI blocks unowned metrics
or edits without owner approval.

H\) Allowed dimensions (starter set)

Time: dt, week, month

Geo: city_id, state, tier

Role: service_role, leg_role

Identity (masked): service_profile_id, user_id (provider/buyer) --- only
in restricted views

Channels: platform (web/ios/android), promotion_campaign_id, type
(boost/featured)

Policy: policy_band_on_cancel, instant_book

Trust: rep_decile, id_verified, trusted_pro

The catalog rejects adhoc dimensions that break grain or privacy.

J\) Acceptance Criteria (mark §5.6 FINAL)

Metrics Catalog created with owners, grains, definitions, tests, and
semver.

Semantic layer exposes curated measures/dims, blocks unsafe joins,
recomputes ratios correctly, and masks PII.

Core keys live: gmv_cents, platform_revenue_cents, take_rate_pct,
bookings_count, cancellations_rate, acceptance_rate_pct,
search_to_inquiry_pct, inquiry_to_booking_pct, on_time_delivery_pct,
safety_reports_per_1k, payout_latency_median_days, promo_spend_cents,
cpb_cents, roas, roas_incremental, rep_decile_share,
tax_collected_cents.

Tests & freshness badges wired to §4.14.12; definition hash shown on
tiles.

Versioning and deprecation documented; CI blocks metric edits without
owner approval.

K\) Why this works

One language for money, growth, and safety reduces debate and
accelerates decisions.

The semantic layer prevents subtle errors (double counts, bad ratios,
PII leaks).

Versioning & tests let us evolve definitions without breaking
dashboards.

§5.7 --- Privacy, PII & Retention

Goal: Keep user data private, minimal, and auditable while still
powering analytics, payouts, safety, and growth. Enforce strict
separation of raw PII, short retentions on noisy logs, and clear unmask
workflows with timeboxed approvals. All choices align with USonly launch
and decisions in §4.12--§4.14 & §5.0--§5.6.

A\) Scope & Principles

USonly data residency at launch; all primary storage and backups in US
regions.

Minimize & mask: Capture the least necessary; store tokens instead of
raw identifiers; mask by default.

Purposebound: Use data only for defined product/ops purposes; anything
else needs Legal signoff.

Defense in depth: Contracts (§5.1) + vault isolation (§5.4) + RBAC
(§4.14.1) + retention (§4.14.15) + DLP scans.

No minors: Platform is 18+. KYC/ID returns an "18+ verified" flag; we do
not keep DOB in analytics layers.

B\) Data Classification (privacy tiers)

Rule: Raw emails/phones/addresses/SSNs are never in events or Gold. Only
tokens & IDs flow through analytics.

C\) PII Handling Patterns

Tokenization at ingest (edge collector):

Email → email_token (salted hash + surrogate key).

Phone → phone_token.

Address → address_token (if needed for payouts).

Tokens are irreversible outside the vault.

Vault_PII (separate schema & keys):

Tables: vault_pii.user_contact, vault_pii.tax_forms,
vault_pii.background_artifacts.

Columnlevel encryption (KMS), access only to Legal/Tax under RBAC + JIT
elevation.

Unmask flow (operational necessity only):

Admin requests JustInTime elevation with reason + case/ticket (§4.14.1).

Timeboxed key to run a scoped unmask function (e.g., contact a user for
payouts/chargeback).

Twoperson approval for tax/background artifacts and bulk unmask.

All accesses logged in a PII access ledger with user, reason, columns,
counts.

Masking in UI/exports:

Masked by default (j\*\*\*@mail.com, (\*\*\*) \*\*\*1234).

All CSV/PDF exports watermarked with requester, timestamp, definition
hash, and query id.

D\) Access Control & Environments

RBAC by role & scope (see §4.14.1).

Rowlevel security for contractors by city_id if needed.

Separate SSO realms for Sandbox vs Prod (see §4.14.16).

Notebook policy: Analysts use gold_restricted via the semantic layer; no
direct vault access.

E\) Consent, Notices & Purpose Limitation

Clickwrap logs (ToS/Privacy) with version, IP/device, and timestamp (see
§4.14.15 G).

Edelivery consent for tax forms stored in vault; indicator mirrored in
Gold (edelivery_consent=true).

Marketing optout respected in messaging systems; flags exposed in Gold
as masked booleans for segmentation (no emails exported).

No secondary use: Any new purpose (e.g., external data sharing) triggers
a privacy review and Legal approval.

F\) Retention & Deletion (USfirst)

Retention profiles (aligned with §4.14.15 D; enforced by purge engine
with a nightly job and a purge ledger):

Deletion (DSR) rules (see §4.14.15 E):

When eligible: remove public content, mask profile, stop
discoverability; preserve finance/tax and any held records.

Tombstones replace names in historic receipts/threads.

Coolingoff window (e.g., 14 days) before irreversible purge.

G\) DeIdentification & Aggregate Sharing

kanonymity thresholds for public/marketing aggregates (e.g., k ≥ 15);
suppress small cells.

Noise injection (±1--3%) optional for externally shared rate metrics.

No raw media or NSFW content in public datasets; thumbnails only,
watermarked.

H\) Encryption, Keys & Secrets

In transit: TLS everywhere; mTLS for admin pipelines.

At rest: Serverside encryption for all buckets/tables; envelope
encryption for vault fields.

Key management: KMS with annual rotation; breakglass policy with dual
approval and full audit.

Secrets: Stored in a dedicated secrets manager; rotated quarterly or on
incident.

I\) DLP & Monitoring

Nightly DLP scans on Bronze/Silver/Gold for forbidden patterns (emails,
SSNs, card PANs).

Alerting to Observability (§4.14.13) on detection; repeat detections
escalate (autoquarantine offending tables).

Outbound controls: Email/SMS gateways block messages containing raw PII
pasted by agents; Admin redaction tool available (§4.14.1 E).

J\) ML & Analytics Privacy

Feature store uses Gold; no direct vault fields in features.

Fairness & privacy review for new models (ranking, risk).

Model cards record training data ranges, features used, evaluation
slices, and privacy notes; ml.prediction events include version and
feature hashes (§5.11).

PII in training notebooks prohibited; static analysis checks for vault
joins.

K\) Audits & Incident Response

PII access ledger: who, when, what columns, counts, reason, ticket id;
weekly digest to Privacy.

Data incidents: Runbook in §4.14.13---containment, scope, user comms
template, regulator threshold checks (US context), rootcause and CAPA
items.

External requests: handled through Legal intake (§4.14.15); gag orders
recorded and honored.

L\) Acceptance Criteria (mark §5.7 FINAL)

Privacy tiers wired into ingest; events with forbidden PII blocked at
edge.

Vault_PII schema live with column encryption, RBAC, and JIT unmask +
twoperson approvals.

Maskbydefault everywhere (UI, exports); watermarking of downloads
enabled.

Retention engine enforces schedules; purge ledger populated; legal holds
pause deletes.

DSR flows (access/export, deletion, optout) operational and logged;
tombstones applied on deletion.

DLP scans nightly with alerts; repeat violations autoquarantine.

Data residency set to US; keys managed via KMS with rotation; secrets
manager in place.

Analyst access constrained to gold_restricted + semantic layer; vault
denied by default.

ML privacy guardrails enforced: no vault joins in features; model cards
captured.

M\) Why this works

Least data, most value: We keep only what we need, as long as we need
it, where it's safest.

Operationally practical: Unmask flows are rare, justified, timeboxed,
and audited---yet Support/Tax can do their work.

Auditable & defensible: Clear ledgers, purge logs, and DLP alarms prove
compliance in audits and incidents.

Futureproof: USfirst, but patterns (vault, tiers, retention) scale to
stricter regimes if we expand later.

§5.8 --- Data Quality & Testing

Goal: Guarantee that everything built on our data---dashboards, payouts,
taxes, safety actions, experiments---rests on correct, fresh,
privacysafe tables. Detect issues early, quarantine safely, block
sensitive outputs when needed, and make fixes auditable and repeatable.

A\) Scope & Objectives

Where we test: SDK/Edge → Bus → Bronze → Silver → Gold → Semantic layer
(metrics) → BI/Exports.

What we test: Contracts, IDs & referential integrity, business
invariants, money & reconciliations, freshness & completeness, privacy &
masking, anomaly baselines.

How we act: Quarantine bad records, gate finance close, flag dashboards,
and page owners with clear runbooks.

B\) Layered Check Matrix (who/when/what)

C\) Test Categories & Examples (starter suite)

1\) Contract & Schema Tests (events)

Required fields present; types correct (money = int cents).

Enums valid: leg_role ∈ {talent, studio}; method ∈ {card, ach}.

No forbidden PII: raw email/phone/address; block at edge (already in
§5.1/§5.7).

Example (Edge validator rule)

If payload.email present → reject and log data.ingest.deny:
forbidden_pii.

2\) Identity & Referential Integrity

Every booking_leg_id in Silver must have a service_profile_id,
buyer_user_id, and city_id.

Every charge_id in Gold lines maps to an lbg_id and to existing legs for
line allocation.

No orphan docs: doc_id must reference an existing booking_leg_id.

Check SQL (Silver → Gold)

SELECT COUNT(\*) AS orphan_legs

FROM silver.fin_events f

LEFT JOIN gold.fact_booking_leg b ON f.booking_leg_id = b.booking_leg_id

WHERE f.event_name LIKE \'fin.%\' AND b.booking_leg_id IS NULL;

Threshold: orphan_legs = 0 (P1 if \>0).

3\) Business Invariants

Time windows: start_at \< end_at; accepted_at ≤ due_at (when
deliverables due).

Status transitions: No illegal jumps (e.g., declined → completed).

NSFW guard: When Safe Mode off for a buyer, paid placements must still
respect policy flags.

4\) Money & Reconciliation

Charge lines sum: Σ fact_payment_line.line_cents =
fact_payment.amount_cents.

Leg allocations: Σ perleg allocations (buyer_fee, tax, processor) =
parent totals (tolerance ≤ 1 cent per charge).

Payouts: Σ fact_payout_leg.net_to_provider_cents =
fact_payout.amount_cents.

Settlements recon: Daily Σ charges/refunds vs processor settlement file
(variance ≤ 0.5%).

Deposits: auth \>= capture + (void \| release); no negative balances.

5\) Freshness & Completeness

Ops freshness: Silver tables lag \< 15 min (p95).

Finance close: Gold finance complete by 06:00 local.

Completeness: For each day/city, \# of completed legs in Gold ≥ 99% of
Silver by 07:00 (after late arrivals).

6\) Privacy & Masking

Masked by default: Emails/phones in Gold must equal masked pattern;
verify no raw patterns via DLP scan.

Vault joins: Blocked in analyst contexts; any query touching
vault_pii.\* outside Tax/Legal → alert + deny.

7\) Statistical/Anomaly Baselines

Click invalid rate (Boost): expected \< 7%; \> 15% triggers P1
investigation.

Zero result rate spikes: baseline + 3σ; flag search regressions.

Rep score distribution weekly drift: JensenShannon distance \> threshold
→ review scoring pipeline.

Unit economics: Take rate dayoverday delta \> 2 p.p. → notify Finance &
Growth.

8\) Metrics Catalog Consistency (from §5.6)

Tile definition hash must match catalog; if not, show "Definition
changed" banner.

Ratios recomputed at query grain; no avgofaverages allowed (semantic
guard).

D\) Severity & Gating (what we block vs warn)

Gating rules:

Finance close blocked on P0 money checks; release requires signoff from
Finance lead.

Payouts job pauses automatically if negative net or variance breaches.

Promotions autothrottle if invalid clicks breach P1 threshold.

E\) Ownership, Frequency & Tooling

Ascode tests in repo (/dq/), versioned with data pipelines; owners: Data
Eng (pipelines), Finance (money rules), Analytics (semantic tests),
Privacy (PII/DLP).

Schedules:

Edge/Silver: continuous;

Gold finance: nightly;

Catalog/semantic: nightly + on deploy;

DLP: nightly;

Baselines: daily/weekly jobs.

Dashboards: Admin Analytics cockpit (§4.14.12) shows DQ status:
red/amber/green per table/metric; freshness gauges; recon variances; DLQ
counts.

Alerts: Slack + email routes from Observability (§4.14.13) with runbook
links.

F\) Example Tests (per table)

gold.fact_booking_leg

start_at \< end_at

status ∈ enum and legal transitions only

leg_role=\'studio\' ⇒ deposit_auth_cents may be nonnull;
leg_role=\'talent\' ⇒ deposit fields must be null

Σ allocations equals parent charge totals (join to fact_payment_line)

gold.fact_lbg

legs_count ≥ 1; money lines sum to GMV formula; amount_charged_cents =
gmv + buyer_fee + tax

gold.fact_payment + fact_payment_line

Lines sum to parent; 3DS present when method=\'card\' and challenge
flagged

gold.fact_promo

cpb_cents = spend_cents / bookings (division by zero prevented); invalid
click ratio thresholds

gold.fact_tax

Jurisdiction fields nonnull for taxed cities/states; latency within SLA;
exception rate \< 1%

Dims (SCD2)

No overlapping valid_from/valid_to for the same natural key; exactly one
current_flag=true

G\) Freshness & Completeness Monitors

Table freshness: materialized view of max updated_at per table; redline
if \>15 min for Silver ops tables.

Completeness: compare counts of completed legs in Silver vs Gold by
city/day after finance close; badge tiles if \<99%.

H\) Quarantine, Replays & Fix Flow (tie to §5.9)

Quarantine families: schema_violation, fk_missing, money_invariant,
privacy_violation.

Replay: after a fix (schema or code), reprocess quarantined batches via
Replay Tool; Gold recomputes only affected partitions.

Audit: all quarantines, replays, and manual overrides logged and
surfaced in Admin analytics.

I\) Documentation & Training

DQ runbooks for each P0/P1 failure with example queries, expected
impacts, and rollback steps.

Sandbox drills (§4.14.16): quarterly exercises for finance close gate,
promotions invalidclick spike, and freshness outage.

J\) Telemetry (DQ events)

dq.schema.fail/pass (event_name, version)

dq.fk_missing (table, count) • dq.invariant.fail (rule_id)

dq.recon.variance (cents) • dq.freshness.breach (table, minutes)

dq.dlp.hit (pattern, table) • dq.quarantine.enqueue/resolve

dq.gate.close.block/release (reason, approver)

K\) Acceptance Criteria (mark §5.8 FINAL)

Layered checks implemented from Edge → BI; failures categorized with
DLQs/quarantine.

Finance recon and allocation math tests gate daily close; payouts pause
on P0s.

Freshness monitors (\<15 min Silver; finance done by 06:00) with alerts
& tiles badges.

Referential & invariant tests cover all core facts/dims; SCD2 overlap
checks live.

Privacy/DLP scans nightly; exports watermarked; vault joins blocked for
analysts.

Baseline anomaly detectors active (invalid clicks, CTR, take rate, rep
distribution).

Replay tool integrated with quarantine; partial recompute only; all
actions audited.

DQ dashboard in Admin shows status, trends, and links to runbooks.

L\) Why this works

Prevents silent errors from creeping into payouts, taxes, and KPIs.

Gives teams clear gates and playbooks, so fixes are fast and traceable.

Keeps trust high with Finance and operators by reconciling to reality
every day.

§5.9 --- Backfills & Replays

Goal: Correct history safely, audibly, and cheaply---whether fixing a
bug, adopting a new schema, filling late data, or reclosing
finance---without double counting, breaking joins, or violating
privacy/retention policies.

A\) When to Replay vs Backfill (choose the right tool)

B\) Event Replay Policy (Bronzefirst, idempotent)

What it does\
Replays original events through the current pipeline so new
parsing/enrichment applies.

How

Replay Tool accepts event_name, date range, optional ids
(booking_leg_id, lbg_id, user_id).

Finds events in archived Bronze (≤90day hot, longer in cold storage) →
republishes to Event Bus with headers: replayed_at=\<ts\>; payload is
unchanged.

Idempotency:

If the original event_id is available, reuse it → Bronze sink stores a
shadow row with replay=true (kept for audit), Silver/Gold upserts
deterministically by natural keys (e.g., event_id or leg/line keys).

If original event_id was missing/invalid, the replay assigns a stable
synthetic key derived from the original record hash.

Guardrails

Scope preview shows row counts and blast radius (downstream tables via
lineage).

Dryrun computes deltas (counts, money sums) without writing.

Privacy tiers respected---no new PII appears.

Freeze windows: during finance close, heavy replays are queued.

C\) Backfill Manager (Admin UI/CLI workflow)

1\) Define the job

Type: Silver fix / Gold finance reclose / SCD2 rebuild / Promotions
recompute / Tax refresh.

Scope: date range, city(ies), role(s), entity filters (ids).

Mode: dryrun → plan; then execute.

2\) Plan output

Tables to recompute, row estimates, money impact (pre vs post),
dependencies (lineage graph).

Runtime and cost estimates; throttling plan.

3\) Execute

Chunked by day×city; idempotent merges with checkpointing; failure
autoresume.

Writes job_id to every affected row (adjustment_job_id) for audit.

4\) Review & finalize

Diff report: row deltas, GMV/Revenue/Tax variances, counts by status.

Signoff gates (Finance for money, Privacy for sensitive scopes).

Publish change notes to Data Catalog & Metric Catalog.

D\) Scoping Impact: lineagebased blast radius

Use table lineage (from §5.4 I) to enumerate downstream objects that
will change (facts, materialized views, dashboards).

Compute metric deltas for catalog keys (from §5.6) in the selected
window: GMV, platform revenue, take rate, tax, CPB/ROAS if promotions
touched.

Flag locked periods (e.g., monthly revenue closed) and switch to
Adjustment Ledger (see G).

E\) Idempotency & Dedup (how we avoid double counts)

Bronze keeps both original and replay shadows; Silver upserts by natural
keys (e.g., event_id or (charge_id,line_no)).

Gold facts use stable keys (booking_leg_id, charge_id, payout_id,
promotion_campaign_id,dt) and overwrite the partition deterministically.

Rerunning the same job with the same scope does not change totals
(idempotent by key).

Compensating events are not required; we prefer deterministic recompute
over appendonly corrections in analytics.

F\) SCD2 Rebuilds & "AsOf" correctness

For dim_service_profile, dim_user, dim_policy, rebuild SCD2 from CDC
(silver.dim\_\*\_cdc) maintaining valid_from/valid_to.

Rebuild ensures no overlaps, exactly one current_flag=true.

Pointintime queries (e.g., price at booking time) are guaranteed by
joining on occurred_at BETWEEN valid_from AND valid_to.

Policy/version drift handled: facts carry policy_id used at the time;
rebuild does not swap historic policy ids.

G\) Gold Finance Reclose & Adjustment Ledger

When

Allocation bug, settlement corrections, tax provider fix, deposit
handling fix, ACH fee miscalc, etc.

How

Lock the target period (e.g., a cityday or full month).

Recompute fact_payment, fact_booking_leg, fact_payout, fact_tax,
fact_deposit for the scope.

If the period is preclose → overwrite facts (idempotent) and publish
diffs.

If postclose (books closed):

Do not overwrite; write to gold.fact_adjustment_ledger with:
adjustment_id, scope, reason_code, delta_cents by line type (gmv,
provider fee, buyer fee, processor fee, tax, payout).

The semantic layer uses facts + Σ adjustments for reporting in "current
view" and exposes a "asreported at date" mode for audit.

Controls

Finance signoff required to post adjustments; job artifacts archived.

H\) Privacy, Holds & Compliance

Legal holds (from §4.14.15) prevent mutation/purge of held rows;
backfill manager skips them and logs.

Retention respected: do not reload Bronze older than configured unless
Legal approves.

PII: backfills never move raw PII into Gold; vault schemas unchanged.

Tax: 1099 figures recomputed only within the tax year open window; else
use Adjustment Ledger with memo.

I\) Performance, Throttling & Cost

Chunking: day×city (or campaign×day) pieces; parallelism capped to
protect warehouse SLOs.

Priority levels: S1 (finance/tax) preempts; S2 (product fixes) scheduled
offpeak; S3 (perf remats) background only.

Materializations: dependent MVs refreshed incrementally; caches
invalidated in scope only.

Rate limits: replay to bus has QPS caps and backpressure; retries
exponential.

J\) QA/Diff & Signoff

Before/After reports: counts (bookings, legs), money (GMV, fees,
payouts, tax), promotions KPIs for affected windows.

Tolerance thresholds: finance variances must go to exact zero in
reclose; product metrics allow tiny drift only if expected by bug fix
(documented).

Dashboards display "Data Updated by Backfill JOBID" badges for the date
range with link to change note.

Rollback: jobs are rerunnable; use prior snapshot (timetravel) or
inverse adjustments for postclose periods.

K\) Telemetry (Backfill/Replay events)

data.replay.start/finish/fail (event_name, range, rows)

data.backfill.plan/execute/finish/fail (job_id, scope, tables, rows,
runtime)

data.backfill.diff (job_id, metric_key, delta_cents/counts)

data.finance.reclose.start/finish (scope) • data.adjustment_ledger.post
(amounts)

data.lineage.impact (job_id, downstream_objects)

data.freeze_window.enter/exit (reason)

L\) Acceptance Criteria (mark §5.9 FINAL)

Replay Tool reads archived Bronze, republishes with replayed_at, and
maintains idempotency; dryrun diff available.

Backfill Manager supports Silver fixes, Gold reclose, SCD2 rebuilds,
promotions/tax recompute; shows plan, costs, lineage, and diffs.

Gold finance reclose implemented with freeze windows and Adjustment
Ledger for postclose corrections.

All operations obey privacy/retention/holds; skipped rows logged.

Chunked execution with checkpoints; resumable on failure; performance
quotas enforced.

Diff reports and catalog change notes autopublished; dashboards badge
updated ranges.

Telemetry & runbooks wired; Finance/Privacy signoffs required where
applicable.

Idempotency proven: rerunning the same job is a noop (byteforbyte or
centsforcents parity).

M\) Why this works

Keeps history correct without breaking audits or inflating metrics.

Provides surgical tools (replay vs backfill) with guardrails and
signoffs.

Honors privacy & retention, while giving Finance and Product confidence
that fixes stick

§5.10 --- External Systems & Lineage

Goal: Integrate thirdparty services (payments, tax, ID/background,
social metrics, content safety, esignature, comms) through strict
adapters and contracts so every external input/output is traceable,
auditable, and LBGaware---and any dashboard number can be traced back to
its upstream source.

A\) Systems Map & Roles (USonly launch)

Money

Payment Processor (card + ACH + 3DS, disputes, payouts): e.g.,
Stripe/Adyenclass.

Tax Engine (sales tax determination): Avalara/TaxJarclass (US
servicestax, city addons).

Bank/KYC/KYB: via payment processor hosted flows.

Trust

ID Verification: Persona/Onfido/Veriffclass (18+ check, liveness).

Background Checks (FCRA): Checkr/Sterlingclass (USonly roles; optin).

Growth & Safety

Social Metrics: IG Graph, YouTube Data, TikTok, X; Phase2: LinkedIn
Pages, FB Pages, Snapchat Public Profile.

Content Safety Scan: VisionAPIclass (image/video nudity/explicit
heuristic).

ESignature: DocuSign/DropboxSignclass (SOW, Releases, House Rules).

Comms: Email (SendGridclass), SMS (Twilioclass), Push (FCM/APNs).

Storage/Deliverables

External links (Drive/Dropbox) + local uploads (thumbnails/proofs).

Each adapter emits/consumes versioned events per §5.1 and writes to
Bronze → Silver → Gold per §5.3--§5.5.

B\) Integration Pattern (Adapter Contract)

Adapter rules (all vendors)

One adapter = one bounded context, versioned (adapter_version), with:

Synchronous API calls (idempotent keys).

Webhook listener (verified signatures; replay protection).

Polling fallback (for missed webhooks).

Identifiers: store vendor ids as external_ref columns
(processor_charge_id, tax_txn_id, idv_verification_id, etc.).

Event mapping: every webhook → ext.\<domain\>.webhook_received, then
internal normalized events (e.g., fin.checkout_pay_success).

Retries: exponential backoff, max 24h. Idempotent by natural keys.

Security: OAuth/scoped API keys in Vault; peradapter RBAC; allowlist IPs
for webhooks; mTLS for admin callbacks.

Observability: latency, error rate, backlog gauges; synthetic tests (see
§4.14.13).

SLA tags: adapter_sla_tier (S1 money, S2 trust, S3 analytics).

C\) Payments & Payouts Adapter (S1)

Capabilities

Card auth/capture, 3DS challenge, ACH debit; refunds/partial refunds.

Disputes/chargebacks lifecycle; evidence uploads.

Payouts with reserves; bank verification (KYC/KYB).

Data flow

Checkout calls processor with lbg_id, amount, idempotency key → returns
processor_charge_id.

Webhook: charge.succeeded/failed, dispute.opened/closed,
payout.paid/failed.

Normalize to §5.1 events: fin.checkout_pay_success/fail,
fin.refund_apply, fin.payout\_\*.

Gold reconciliation: fact_payment, fact_payout (see §5.5), tie to
settlements in §5.3.

Edge cases

ACH returns (R01/R07\...): mapped to fin.checkout_pay_fail with code →
autocancel leg per policy.

Split payments (rare): still one charge_id per LBG; lineitems allocate
across legs.

Security

3DS indicators stored; PAN never touches our systems; tokens only.

D\) Tax Adapter (S1 for Finance, S2 for Ops)

When

At checkout (quote), at amendments (change orders), and on refunds.

Flow

Request: lbg_id, origin/destination (city/state), taxable base, role
(talent/studio).

Response: tax cents, jurisdiction codes, latency; store tax_txn_id.

Webhook/poll: provider status changes (rate updates/errors).

Tables

gold.fact_tax line per calc; joins to fact_payment.

Failover: if calc down ⇒ show buyer banner "tax delayed," proceed only
where legally safe (setting in §4.14.7).

E\) ID Verification Adapter (S2)

Flow

Hosted KYC: user launches flow → idv_verification_id → webhook status
(approved\|refused\|reupload).

Store flags (ID Verified true/false), selfie liveness score; no raw docs
in analytics.

Emits: ts.idv_submit, ts.idv_decision.

PII

Raw images/IDs in vendor; we store only tokens & status (see §5.7).

F\) Background Check Adapter (S2, FCRA)

Flow

Optin; collect consent; submit job with bg_check_id.

Webhook status: clear\|consider\|review_required.

Adverse action workflow in Admin (twostep notices).

Emits: ts.bg_submit, ts.bg_decision, ts.bg_adverse_action.

Compliance

Store report IDs & statuses, not report contents; retention 5--7 years
per §5.7.

G\) Social Metrics Connectors (S2 analytics)

Platforms (Day1) IG, YouTube, TikTok, X (per §1.2 addendum).\
Flow

OAuth connect → nightly sync (30/90day growth, ER, followers, avg
views); manual refresh 3×/day.

Ratelimit aware; backoff on quota errors.

Emits: social.snapshot_pull, social.snapshot_store.

Writes to gold.fact_social_snapshot (verified flag).

Privacy

Tokens in Vault; scopes minimal (readonly insights).

H\) Content Safety Scan (S2 safety)

What

Image/video classification (nudity/explicit/violence), OCR for text
overlays, unsafe keyword lists.

Used on: profile portfolio, public thumbnails, featured media (not
private Drive/Dropbox manifests).

Flow

Upload → async scan → verdict (approve\|quarantine\|remove) with
confidence.

Emits: content.scan_request, content.moderation_decision.

Admin can override with reason; all logged.

Policy

Artistic nudity allowed; explicit sexual content blocked in public
areas; "Safe Mode" default for buyers (see §1.5 & §4.5).

I\) ESignature Adapter (S2)

Use

SOW (scope/pricing), Model Releases (roleaware), Studio House Rules.

Flow

Template render → send envelope → webhook signed/declined/voided.

Emits: doc.sow_generate, doc.release_sign.

Store PDF hash, envelope id, signer ids; PDF in secure object store
(7year retention).

J\) Comms Adapters (S2)

Email (transactional): receipts, payout notices, safety messages.\
SMS: 2FA codes, critical booking updates.\
Push: new inquiry, timesensitive reminders.

Rules

No raw PII beyond recipient; templating via Smart Docs CMS (§4.14.10);
unsubscribe/optout respected (flags in Gold).

K\) Storage/Deliverables

Local uploads: thumbnails, small proofs; scanned by Content Safety;
stored with checksum.

External links: Drive/Dropbox manifests (name, size, checksum), not
mirrored to avoid cost; manifests used for disputes (§3.5).

L\) Lineage: "Follow the money/decision" maps

Example 1 --- A payout on a modeling leg

External: charge.succeeded → fin.checkout_pay_success (Bronze) →
Silver/Gold fact_payment.

Booking completes → fin.payout_queue/sent webhooks → fact_payout +
fact_payout_leg.

Dashboard tile "Provider earnings" references Gold facts; lineage panel
lists processor charge id, payout id, adapter_version.

Example 2 --- ID Verified badge

idv.verification.completed webhook → ts.idv_decision (Silver) →
dim_user.id_verified=true (Gold SCD2).

Search ranking uses Rep & verified flags; lineage shows vendor
decision + time.

Example 3 --- Social ER filter

OAuth token → nightly pull social.snapshot_pull →
gold.fact_social_snapshot.

Search filter queries Gold; lineage includes platform, token scope, last
refresh.

M\) SLAs, Monitoring & Failover

Alerts route to Observability (§4.14.13) with runbooks.

N\) Security & Secrets

API keys/OAuth tokens in Vault; rotation schedules; scopes least
privilege.

Webhook HMAC signature checks; replayattack windows.

IP allowlists where supported; dedicated webhook endpoints per adapter.

Encrypted logs for external callbacks; PII minimized.

O\) Telemetry (external I/O events)

ext.payment.api_call (latency, status) •
ext.payment.webhook_received/verified

ext.tax.calc_request/response (latency, tax_cents)

ext.idv.webhook_received/decision • ext.bg.webhook_received/decision

ext.social.pull.start/finish (platform, rows) •
ext.content.scan.request/decision

ext.esign.envelope.send/status • ext.comms.send.success/fail

All entries include adapter_version, external_ref, lbg_id/booking_leg_id
when relevant.

P\) Acceptance Criteria (mark §5.10 FINAL)

Each external system has a documented adapter (sync API + webhook +
polling fallback), versioned and emitting §5.1 events.

External refs stored (charge/payout/tax/idv/bg/social/esign ids) and
visible in Gold lineage columns.

Reconciliation pipelines tie payments/payouts/tax to settlements;
variance alerts live (§5.8).

Security: keys in Vault, HMAC webhook checks, IP allowlists, leastscope
OAuth, audit logs.

SLAs & monitors per adapter; synthetic tests; failover behaviors
defined.

Content safety in place for public assets; quarantine path & admin
override logged.

Esignature hooks populate doc hashes and status; PDFs retained 7 years.

Social metrics nightly/refresh flows populate fact_social_snapshot with
verified flag & timestamps.

Lineage panel in Admin shows endtoend source→table for money and trust
decisions.

Q\) Why this works

Clear adapter boundaries prevent vendor sprawl from leaking into core
logic.

Endtoend lineage lets Finance, Ops, and T&S trust every number and
decision.

Strong security and PII minimization keep us compliant while still
useful.

SLAs + monitoring keep external outages from silently corrupting
analytics or UX.

Next up: §5.11 --- ML Feature Store & Modeling Hooks --- define feature
views (ranking, risk, Smart Invites), offline/online parity, training
data contracts, model versioning, bias checks, and how predictions
roundtrip into events & metrics.

§5.11 --- ML Feature Store & Modeling Hooks

Goal: Power ranking, recommendations, risk, and ops automation with
auditable, privacysafe ML. Ensure offline/online parity, clear feature
contracts, conservative guardrails (no paytowin, no FCRAsensitive
automation), and fast rollback. Models must measurably improve
Search→Inquiry→Booking without harming trust or fairness.

A\) Decisions we'll (carefully) augment with ML

Search Reranker (within organic slots only)\
Predict P(inquiry\|query,card) and P(booking\|inquiry,card); combine
with match score to rank organic results. Paid slots remain separately
capped (per §3.3).

Smart Invites (provider & buyer)\
Suggest matches to message/book now; optimize for booking probability
and schedule fit (availability & distance).

Promotions Quality Score\
For paid Boost ordering (within paid caps): predict expected CTR and
booking lift to weight bids (per §3.3 E).

Risk & Reliability Signals\
Early warnings on likely noshows, late cancels, chargeback risk,
invalidclick rings (anomaly models feed §4.14.13 runbooks).

Guardrail: Risk models flag for human or policy rules; they do not
autosanction.

Price & Package Hints (seller tools)\
Nonbinding suggestions: "Packages priced in the top 10% for your city
lead to 23% fewer inquiries." No autopricing.

Message Triage Hints\
Classify intent/urgency to surface threads that likely convert soon;
never autorespond.

B\) Offline/Online Architecture (Feature Store)

Offline (training)

Source: Gold facts & dims (§5.5) joined pointintime (between
valid_from/valid_to) to prevent leakage.

Stored as feature views (parquet) with featureset_version and entity
keys: service_profile_id, buyer_user_id, city_id, dt.

Online (inference)

Lowlatency feature cache (KV store) keyed by (service_profile_id,
city_id) and (buyer_user_id).

TTLs per group (e.g., availability 5 min; social metrics 24 h; rep score
1 h; reliability 24 h).

Backfill on miss: fall back to heuristics + minimal onthefly compute
(distance, schedule overlap).

Parity checks: nightly compare offline vs online distributions; drift
alarms (§5.8).

C\) Feature Groups (PIIsafe, unitized)

Provider / Service Profile (roleaware)

rep_score_role (0--100), id_verified (bool), trusted_pro (bool),
instant_book (bool)

Pricing stats: price_min_cents, price_max_cents,
price_percentile_city_role

Performance: acceptance rate, completion rate, ontime delivery, dispute
rate (90day, 180day windows)

Availability density next 14 days; responsetime median (last 60 days)

Social: followers, avg views, ER (basis points), growth flags (verified
only flags)

Buyer

Historical spend decile, cancel rate, dispute rate, verified status, ACH
on file (ACH reduces buyer fee, a conversion lever)

Query intent features: budget percentile vs market, role searched, NSFW
preference state (policysafe)

Query & Context

Role, city, distance (km), requested start/end (local time), flexibility
window, NSFW filter, license type

Market liquidity indicators (supply/demand index by city/role/hour)

Interaction & Graph

Prior collaborations (buyer↔provider), message history recency,
shortlists/boards presence

Studio (when applicable)

Studio verified (bool), deposit rule (percent/cap), amenity match score,
distance, availability

No raw PII (emails/phones/addresses). Sensitive attributes (e.g.,
gender, race) are not collected and must not be inferred.

D\) Feature Contracts & Storage

Schema: feature_key (string), featureset_version (semver),
entity_key(s), as_of_ts, columns of typed features.

Units: money in cents, times in minutes, percentages in basis points.

Nulls: explicit defaults (e.g., -1 for unknown percentile); masks for
unavailable signals.

Docs: every feature has an owner, definition, refresh cadence, and
expected range.

E\) Training Datasets & Labels

Search Reranker

Positive labels: result clicks → inquiries; inquiries → accepted
bookings (separate heads or cascaded models).

Negatives: shown results not clicked or clicked but never
inquired/booked (biascontrolled with exposure logs).

Splits: timebased (train on T8w to T2w; validate on T2w to T1w; test on
last week).

Calibrate scores (Platt/Isotonic) to produce probability estimates.

Smart Invites

Label: booking within 7 days after invite (or within thread), weighted
by fulfillment.

Risk

Label: noshow, late cancel, chargeback; classimbalance techniques with
costsensitive losses; human review for actions.

Promotions QS

Label: valid click, inquiry, booking from promoted impression; holdout
used for incremental lift training target.

Fairness & leakage checks

Pointintime joins only; coldstart cohorts tested explicitly.

Outcome disparity monitored by city, role, tenure decile, price decile
(we avoid protected classes).

F\) Model Registry & Cards

model_key (e.g., rank.v1, smart_invite.v1, risk.v1, promo_qs.v1) with
semver and featureset_version hash.

Model Card includes: objective, data ranges, features used, evaluation
metrics (AUC, PR, calibration), slices, known limits, fairness audits,
and rollback plan.

Artifacts stored with checksums; reproducible training scripts and
seeds.

Approval workflow: marketplace PM + T&S signoff for rank/risk models.

G\) Inference APIs & Integration Points

Unified inference service

POST /ml/predict with { model_key@version, context: {
query/buyer/profile/lbg }, features_override?, request_id, ab_cell }

Returns { predictions\[\], latency_ms, model_version,
featureset_version, warnings\[\] }

SLOs

Ranking per page: p95 \< 50 ms (excluding feature fetch); Smart Invites
batch: p95 \< 300 ms.

Search pipeline hook

Retrieve eligible organic candidates (postfilter).

Fetch features, call rank.vX.

Blend: organic rank = base_match_score × calibrated P(inquiry) ×
availability/distance priors.

Guardrails: diversity by price and newseller exposure; cap dominance; do
not reorder paid slots.

Fallback: if ML fails, use heuristic scoring (match × rep × availability
× distance).

Promotions

promo_qs.vX provides QS used in paid ordering: paid_order =
log(bid)\*w + QS\*(1-w) (w from §3.3 E).

Risk & Ops

Risk outputs route to Support/T&S queue with thresholds & playbooks
(never autoban).

H\) Logging, Monitoring & Drift

Prediction logs (ml.prediction events): model_key, version,
featureset_version, request_id, topk ids & scores, latency, ab_cell,
privacy_tier=public.

Outcome join later to compute true lift/Calib (stored in Gold).

Drift monitors: PSI/KS on key features vs training; calibration error
over time; alert if thresholds breached.

Shadow deploys: new model runs silently; compare against live in
dashboards; promote on win.

I\) Fairness, Safety & Policy Constraints

No protected attributes used or inferred.

Representation safeguards: ensure new/lowreview profiles get minimum
exposure share; cap ranking dominance by any single cohort.

Explainability: percard reasons ("Instant Book, 2h response, 95 rep,
close by") in UI sourced from features, not raw SHAP.

Humanintheloop for any negative outcome (risk flags). No automated
adverse actions (FCRA).

Paid integrity: models cannot place ineligible cards into paid slots;
eligibility & caps remain rulebased (§3.3).

NSFW policy respected in all candidate generation; ML cannot override
Safe Mode.

J\) Experimentation

AB framework integrates with semantic layer (§5.6): define primary
metrics (Inquiry→Booking), guardrails (Safety reports/1k, take rate).

Power analysis for target deltas; sequential tests with early stop
rules.

Holdouts for Promotions incrementality remain enforced.

Citybycity rollouts; quick killswitch in §4.14.2 if KPIs regress.

K\) Acceptance Criteria (mark §5.11 FINAL)

Feature Store live with documented feature groups, TTLs, and
featureset_versioning; offline/online parity monitors green.

Search Reranker integrated with guardrails; p95 latency \< 50 ms;
fallback path proven.

Smart Invites model live; measurable boost to inquiries/bookings vs
control.

Promotions QS plugged into paid ordering within caps; ROAS uplift
tracked.

Risk flags route to ops queues; no autosanctions; audit trail present.

Model Registry & Cards populated; approvals captured; reproducible
artifacts stored.

Prediction logging with outcomes join; drift & calibration monitors with
alerts.

Fairness safeguards enforced (exposure floors, dominance caps, no
protected attributes).

Killswitch & rollbacks wired via feature flags; shadow→canary→100%
playbook documented.

L\) Why this works

Improves discovery and throughput without compromising fairness or
safety.

Offline/online parity + versioned features prevents silent regressions.

Clear governance, human oversight, and quick rollback make ML a safe
accelerator, not a liability.

§5.12 --- Cost, Freshness & Access Budgets

Goal: Keep the data platform fast, predictable, and affordable. Define
freshness SLOs, error budgets, spend guardrails, and perteam access
quotas so Finance, Product, Ops, and T&S can trust the numbers without
runaway warehouse bills---or lag that breaks daily ops.

A\) Scope & Principles

Freshness first where it matters (ops dashboards, fraud/risk, inbox
hygiene). Accuracy first for finance/tax close.

Budget as a product: visible, predictable limits with selfserve requests
and audit trails (no hidden throttles).

Push computation to the edges: preaggregate hot metrics, partition
properly, cache aggressively.

Make waste obvious: top query offenders, unused MVs, stale tiles, and
overwide scans are surfaced in Admin Analytics (§4.14.12).

B\) Freshness SLOs & Error Budgets

SLO = the target. Error budget = permissible miss window per week/city.\
We track both p95 freshness and absolute deadlines; breaches consume
error budget.

Rules

P0 breach: Miss finance close or T&S feed → page SRE + Finance/T&S; gate
payouts (see §5.8).

P1 breach: Promotions/ops freshness SLO missed beyond budget → throttle
heavy adhoc queries; raise compute class (below).

C\) Cost Centers & Budget Guardrails (launch)

We expose budgets as monthly caps with weekly pacing and alert
thresholds (70%/90%/100%). Amounts are configdriven in Admin (§4.14.12
D11).

Alerting: 70% (info), 90% (action required), 100% (throttle/kill
switches per §4.14.2).

D\) Access Budgets & Team Quotas

We enforce perteam daily TB scan quotas, concurrency limits, and safe
query rules. Quotas are visible to users ("budget bar" in query UI).

Safe Query Rules

Mandatory partition predicates on dt and city or role for facts \> 30
days.

Kill if scan \> threshold (e.g., 2 TB) or wildcard select without
predicate on large tables.

No vault joins for nonLegal/Tax roles (blocked).

Result set cap: 5M rows (exports), else require approval.

E\) Compute Classes & Scheduling

We define compute classes with priority, autoscaling, and max spend:

Windows

Finance close: 00:30--06:00 local.

Backfills: 22:00--06:00 (city local); autopause if S1/S2 lag \> SLO.

F\) Materialization & Caching Plan (costsavvy)

Hot MVs (hourly): marketplace KPIs, promotions ROAS, search CTR
(day×city×role).

Result cache: 15--60 min for popular tiles; cachebusting only on input
change.

Prejoin views: conforming dims (time, city, role) to avoid wide
selfjoins.

Approximate queries: enable HyperLogLog/countdistinct sketches for
exploration; exact on publish.

Autoprune unused MVs (30 days) with review.

G\) Monitoring, Dashboards & Alerts

Admin Analytics (§4.14.12) adds:

Spend by schema/table (top N), TB scanned, credits used, and egress
(day/week/month).

Freshness gauges per table family vs SLO.

Budget bars per team; clickthrough to heaviest queries & visual EXPLAIN.

Error budget burndown (weekly) with forecast of breach.

Anomaly detection: sudden TB scan spikes, new Cartesian joins, or
missing partition filters → automessage query author with suggestions &
oneclick fix.

Alerts route to relevant owners + SRE with links to runbooks and kill
switches (feature flags in §4.14.2).

H\) Governance & Change Control

Budget changes: request in Admin → owner approval (Data Eng + Finance) →
effective next day; all changes logged.

Exception windows: planned workshops or monthend reporting can get
temporary boosts (timeboxed).

MV add/remove: RFC with cost/benefit; review after 30 days.

Backfill approval: required for S3/S4 jobs that would exceed weekly
compute plan.

I\) Developer & Analyst UX

Preflight checker in SQL editor: warns on missing dt/city_id filters,
shows estimated TB scan, suggests MV or sample.

Oneclick "Use Sample" for exploration (downsampled views).

"Why was my query killed?" panel: rule, threshold, and fix suggestions.

Selfserve burst: request +50% quota for 2 hours with justification;
autoapprove within set guardrails.

J\) Telemetry (cost & freshness)

cost.warehouse.credits_used • cost.tb_scanned • cost.object_storage_gb •
cost.egress_gb

freshness.table.p95_minutes (by table) • freshness.deadline.breach

budget.team.usage • budget.team.threshold_hit (70/90/100)

query.kill (reason, tb_estimate) • query.warn (missing_partition)

mv.hit/miss • cache.hit/miss • mv.autoprune

error_budget.consume/reset (product, minutes)

K\) Acceptance Criteria (mark §5.12 FINAL)

Freshness SLOs and weekly error budgets configured; breaches consume
budget and page owners appropriately.

Cost centers with caps & alerts live; throttles wired (compute class
preemption, query kill rules).

Perteam TB/day quotas and concurrency limits enforced; "budget bar"
visible in query UI.

Safe query rules (mandatory partitions, result caps, vault blocks)
enforced with friendly preflight.

Compute classes (S1--S4) scheduled; backfills run offpeak with autopause
under S1/S2 pressure.

Materializations & caches in place; unused MVs autopruned; approx
queries available for exploration.

Admin dashboards show spend, freshness, and budget burndown; top
offenders and EXPLAIN links visible.

All telemetry events emitted; runbooks linked from alerts; budget change
approvals audited.

L\) Why this works

Predictable freshness for ops and truth at close for Finance---without
carteblanche spending.

Teams get freedom within limits and clear feedback loops when they
approach those limits.

Cost optimizations (partitions, MVs, caches) are built into the UX, not
bolted on.

Error budgets and preemption keep us stable during spikes while
preserving critical flows.

§5.13 --- Experimentation & Causal Measurement

Goal: Ship changes with proof. Run trustworthy A/B tests that respect
marketplace interference, keep trust/safety guardrails, and tie results
to the versioned Metrics Catalog (§5.6). Support both userlevel and
marketlevel experiments (e.g., fees, ranking), plus holdouts for paid
promotions (§3.3).

A\) Scope & Objectives

One platform for A/B, switchback (timebased), geo/city tests, and
alwayson holdouts.

Sticky assignment, auditable exposure logs, power analysis, sequential
monitoring, and preregistration of hypotheses/metrics.

Guardrails for safety, cancellations, takerate, and
fairness---autorollback on breach.

All results computed via the semantic layer (§5.6) with definition
hashes.

B\) Randomization Units & Assignment

Units (choose per test):

Buyerlevel (buyer_user_id) --- search/reranker UI, messaging nudges,
checkout copy.

Provider/profilelevel (service_profile_id) --- seller tools, pricing
hints, availability UI.

Thread/leglevel (message_thread_id / booking_leg_id) --- messaging
flows, deliverables UI.

Citylevel / Switchback (time slots by city) --- marketplace policies,
fee displays, highinterference features.

Campaignlevel (promotion_campaign_id) --- promotions QS/bidding
experiments.

Assignment service (deterministic & auditable):

Hash(unit_id + experiment_key + salt) → bucket in \[0..9999\]; map to
variants by allocation (e.g., 90/10).

Stratification options: by city_id, role, and traffic band to balance.

Stickiness: stored in exp.assignment table; crossdevice via account id.

Collisions: mutualexclusion sets for tests touching the same surface;
scheduler enforces only one live per surface/city.

C\) Exposure & Event Logging

Assignment: exp.assign (unit_id, experiment_key, variant, hash, time,
city, role).

Exposure: exp.expose when the unit actually sees the decision point
(e.g., results page rendered, DM nudge shown).

Primary conversions (via §5.6 metrics):

Buyer: Search→Inquiry, Inquiry→Booking, GMV, Buyer fee takerate effect.

Provider: Acceptance rate, Completion, Net earnings, Response time.

All experiment events land in Silver and Gold (gold.fact_experiment)
with joins to outcomes.

D\) Test Types & Recommended Designs

Standard A/B (low interference)

Buyerlevel for ranking tweaks, copy, forms.

Providerlevel for dashboard UX, analytics, or hints.

Analysis: clusterrobust SEs at unit; CUPED (see §F).

Switchback (timebased by city)

Use for marketplacewide knobs (caps, density, InstantBook incentives)
where crossunit interference is strong.

Alternate treatment/control in randomized time slots (e.g., 2hour
blocks) per city; ensure stationarity checks.

Geo / City Experiments

Use distinct city cohorts as arms; match on historical KPIs;
differenceindifferences (DiD) with preperiod.

Promotion Holdouts (alwayson)

5--10% holdout of eligible impressions per city/role to estimate
incremental bookings/GMV for paid Boost/Featured (§3.3).

Sequential Rollouts (canary → city cohort → 100%)

Guardrails checked at each step; autopause on breach.

E\) PreRegistration & Guardrails

Prereg template (per test): hypothesis, units, allocation, primary
metric(s), acceptable risk, guardrails, MDE, min sample size, analysis
plan, stop rules.

Guardrails (monitored continuously):

Safety: reports per 1k legs (cityday) must not rise \> +0.2 absolute;
noshow rate must not rise \> +0.5 p.p.

Economics: takerate must not fall \> 1.0 p.p. unless explicitly allowed;
negative net booking revenue prohibited.

Fairness/Exposure: maintain minimum exposure to new providers (≥ target
share) and price diversity.

Freshness: ops data lag must meet §5.12 SLOs; otherwise, evaluation
pauses.

Autorollback: Feature flag flips to control if any guardrail crosses
threshold for N consecutive checks (configurable; default 3).

F\) Power, Estimation & Stats

Power & sample size

Builtin calculator: baseline rate, MDE, alpha, power → sample per
variant.

Use clustered power calcs when units generate multiple events (e.g.,
buyer searches many times).

Estimators

Differenceinmeans with clusterrobust SEs (unitclustered).

CUPED for variance reduction using preperiod covariates (e.g., buyer's
historical conversion).

DiD for city/switchback (pre vs post × treat vs control).

Winsorization for heavytailed \$\$ outcomes; or use medianofmeans.

Sequential tests: O'BrienFleming or Pocock boundaries for early stopping
with overall α control.

Multiple testing

Limit simultaneous tests per surface; apply BenjaminiHochberg FDR for
families of related metrics.

G\) Analysis Pipeline & Reporting

Analysis runs from Gold via the semantic layer (§5.6) to ensure correct
grains and LBG handling.

Each test produces an experiment report artifact: variant effects, CIs,
pvalues, CUPED details, slice table (city, role, rep decile, price
decile), guardrail plots, and definition hashes for all metrics used.

Reports stored with exp_report_id and linked in Admin → Experiments.

H\) Interference, Spillovers & Bias Controls

Buyer crossover: if a buyer in variant A messages a provider in variant
B, the buyer's assignment governs buyerside outcomes; leglevel outcomes
are attributed using the decision path (documented).

Provider capacity effects: for ranking tests, cap exposure so one
variant doesn't monopolize top slots (diversity constraints).

Time trends: switchback blocks randomized; include timeofday/dayofweek
fixed effects.

Simultaneous tests: mutualexclusion sets; RFC needed to corun on same
surface.

I\) Ethics & Policy

No protected attributes used for assignment or modeling.

Risk models flag only; no automated adverse actions (§5.11).

NSFW policy remains enforced in candidates; experiments cannot bypass
Safe Mode.

Informed UX: no "dark patterns" (e.g., fake scarcity); experiments may
vary copy but not materially mislead.

Data use: limited to platform improvement (see §5.7 Purpose Limitation).

J\) Telemetry (experiment events)

exp.assign (unit, experiment_key, variant)

exp.expose (surface, decision_point)

exp.guardrail.breach (metric_key, value, threshold)

exp.sequential.boundary.hit (stage)

exp.report.publish (exp_id, report_url, metric_hashes)

All events include definition_hash and catalog_version for metrics.

K\) Acceptance Criteria (mark §5.13 FINAL)

Assignment service with deterministic hashing, stratification, sticky
storage, and mutualexclusion sets.

Event schema for exp.assign/exp.expose live; exposures logged at
decision points.

Library of test designs: A/B, switchback, city geo tests, promotions
holdouts.

Prereg workflow in Admin; power calculator; templates; stop rules
configurable.

Guardrails wired (safety, economics, fairness) with autorollback to
control via feature flags.

Analysis jobs read Metrics Catalog via semantic layer; reports saved
with reproducible artifacts and definition hashes.

Sequential monitoring supported; multipletesting control applied to
families.

Interference mitigations (diversity caps, time FE, exclusivity);
documentation for attribution paths.

Telemetry & dashboards show experiment status, lifts, and guardrail
health.

L\) Why this works

Respects marketplace dynamics (interference, fairness) while giving us
clean causal reads.

Guardrails keep us from trading trust & economics for shortterm wins.

Results are auditable and reproducible---the same numbers anyone sees on
dashboards.

§6.1 --- Phase0 Foundations (T0 → T+30)

Goal: Ship an endtoend singleleg booking experience (search → profile →
request/Instant Book → escrow → chat → delivery link → release/accept →
payout) that's safe, auditable, and supportable---good enough for a
small private alpha in Houston (signups open nationwide). Everything is
featureflagged, USonly, with artisticnudityonly public media, card
payments + escrow, ID verification v1, Admin v1, and a basic daily
finance close.

A\) Scope (what's in vs out)

In (musthaves)

Accounts & Roles: multirole user with service profiles for Model /
Photographer / Videographer / Creator (max 3 profiles in Phase0).

Profiles & Portfolios: images + short video thumbnails;
tagging/approvals; SafeMode for public media.

Search v1: role, city/radius, availability window, price range, core
model attributes (height, hair color, categories), no social API filters
yet (selfreported fields allowed; labeled Unverified).

Packages & Pricing: provider sets packages, addons, licensing tiers;
travel fee rules (base radius, permile or flat zone).

Booking v1: request flow + Instant Book (for IDverified only), escrow on
accept/IB, scheduling with provider calendar.

Messaging v1: threaded chat + attachments (images/pdf); read receipts;
quoting a message into a changeorder request.

Change Orders & Reschedule v1: provider can propose time/price edits;
buyer approves → escrow adjusts; audit trail (see §1.4 addendum).

Cancellation & Refund Policy Engine v1: roleaware, timebanded rules;
automatic fee math and receipts.

Deliverables via External Links: Google Drive/Dropbox manifest capture
(name, size, checksum, link, timestamp) + Accept/NeedsChanges + final
Accept.

ID Verification v1: hosted KYC; ID Verified gate unlocks Instant Book
and minor search nudge; background checks optout (Phase1).

Payments: card (3DS where required), single currency USD; escrow; payout
48h postcompletion; reserves for first payouts.

Receipts & Finance Close v0: singleleg receipts, amended receipts on
changes/refunds, basic daily close (no multicity tax complexity yet).

Admin v1: Support can view bookings, reschedule, issue refunds per
policy, adjust price (within caps), close disputes; Trust can approve
IDV; Finance can reissue receipts.

Houston seed: import/onboard an initial supply cohort across the four
roles; invite a small buyer set.

Out (defer to Phase1/2)

Paid Promotions (Boost/Featured) → Phase1 pilot.

LBG (multileg group checkout, e.g., talent + studio) → Phase2.

Studios marketplace & deposits → Phase2.

ACH payments & Early Payout → Phase1+.

Social metrics API filters (IG/YT/TT/X) → Phase1; Phase0 shows
Unverified chips if selfreported.

Background checks, advanced safety addons, reputation score breaking
into deciles → Phase1.

Feed posts, boards, complex analytics suites → Phase1+.

B\) Deliverables & Acceptance Tests (DoD)

Service Profiles & Portfolio

Can create up to 3 profiles (e.g., Model + Photographer).

Upload images (max 50), short video thumbnails; tag collaborators for
approval.

DoD: profile page loads \<2.0s; SafeMode thumbnails on by default;
collaborator tag → approval flow works.

Search v1

Filters: role, city + radius, availability window, price min/max, model
attributes (height, hair, categories), Instant Book toggle.

Cards show: name/role, price range, availability badge, distance, ID
Verified chip.

DoD: search → profile click p95 \< 600ms (cached), zeroresult handling
has suggestions; Instant Book filter hides ineligible.

Packages, Addons, Licensing, Travel

Provider configures packages; addon menu (e.g., extra edits); license
tiers (web/social/commercial); travel rules: base radius free, permile
beyond or fixed zones (City/Metro/National).

addons itemized in checkout & receipt.

Booking & Escrow

Request flow with provider accept/decline; Instant Book for IDverified
providers.

Escrow charge on accept/IB; autocancel if not accepted within policy
window.

DoD: escrow transaction succeeds, state machine:
requested→accepted→inprogress→delivered→completed; timeouts & cancels
reflect in UI.

Messaging & Change Orders

Threaded chat; attach sample moodboard; quote message into Change Order
(time or price); buyer approves to apply.

DoD: change order reissues updated receipt; both parties see a version
timeline.

Deliverables & Acceptance

Provider posts manifest (Drive/Dropbox links + checksums); buyer marks
Needs changes or Accept.

DoD: Accept triggers completion → payout queue; manifest audit is
visible in case of dispute.

Cancellation/Refund Policy v1

Timebanded rules (e.g., buyer 24--72hout: 50% refund; \<24h: 0%;
providerfault: 100%).

DoD: refunds post automatically with correct math & receipts;
providerfault returns buyer service fee.

ID Verification v1

Hosted KYC; success flips ID Verified; failure paths handled (retry).

DoD: Instant Book locked behind IDV; search nudges verified cards; Admin
can view/override with reason.

Payments & Payouts v0

recorded (no public badge yet).

G\) Operational Runbooks (must exist)

Refunds & Changes: how support selects policy band, applies partial
refunds, and reissues receipts.

Escrow & Payouts: what to do on 3DS failure, payout failure, reserve
queries.

IDV: handling failed verifications and manual overrides with reasons.

Disputes: evidence checklist (chat, manifest, release PDF), timeline,
and guidance.

Incident: payments outage, tax outage (Phase0 tax mostly off), messaging
outage.

H\) Alpha Demo Script (acceptance)

Buyer searches Houston Photographers, radius 15mi, Instant Book on →
selects a card.

Views package, adds addon + license; enters address outside free radius
→ travel autoadds.

Instant Books → card 3DS challenge → escrow authorized; thread opens
with autosummary.

Provider proposes reschedule + small price adjustment via change order →
buyer approves; receipt amends.

Shoot completes; provider posts Drive manifest; buyer requests changes
(1 round) → accepts; payout queued.

Payout lands (sandbox), statements show math; daily close report
reconciles.

Admin: support simulates refund per band; trust approves an IDV; finance
reissues a receipt.

Pass if: no manual DB edits, all receipts correct, payout ledger
reconciles, audit trail complete.

I\) Risks & Mitigations (Phase0 specific)

Escrow edge cases (card fail, 3DS friction) → clear recovery UI, retry
flow, and support macro.

Travel fee confusion → price box preview + tooltip; map radius
visualization.

Deliverables offplatform → manifest enforce + checksum capture; clear
"deliver here" guidance.

Low supply → concierge onboarding + verification subsidy coupons for
first cohort.

Support load → macros & calculators; case templates for
refunds/reschedules.

J\) OutofScope (explicit)

Promotions, Studios, ACH, Early Payout, Social API filters, Background
checks, ML ranker, LBG. These are flagged off and not required to pass
Phase0.

K\) Acceptance Criteria (mark §6.1 FINAL)

Endtoend singleleg booking with escrow and payout works in sandbox &
prod with feature flags.

ID Verified gate enforced for Instant Book; nonverified can still accept
requests.

Change Orders & Reschedule update escrow and generate amended receipts;
version timeline visible.

Cancellation/Refund engine applies policy bands with correct fee math;
providerfault refunds buyer fee.

Deliverables manifest captured; Accept/Needschanges/Accept flow drives
completion & payout.

Admin v1 supports reschedule, refund within bands, price adjust, message
redaction, and IDV approval---all audited.

Daily finance close runs; reconciliation variance ≤ 0.5%; payout
statements downloadable.

Ops tiles live (search→request, etc.); freshness \<15 min; DQ tests
(money sums, orphan checks) green 5 days.

Houston seed cohort onboarded; ≥30 active providers and ≥20 buyers
complete at least one test booking.

Alpha demo script passes endtoend without engineering intervention.

L\) Why this works

It delivers a credible, safe loop for real bookings with minimal surface
area.

Flags & cutlines keep scope tight; Admin v1 ensures we don't need code
for routine ops.

Sets the foundation for Phase1 additions (promotions, ACH, social
filters) without rework.

§6.2 --- Phase1 Public Beta (T+30 → T+90)

Goal: Open Houston to public beta (signups nationwide), prove repeatable
bookings, and validate two monetization levers---takerate and usagebased
promotions (pilot)---while adding verified social metrics search, ACH
with buyerfee discount, Trusted Pro (background checks, optin), and
reputation scoring v1. Everything remains flaggated, measured, and
reversible.

A\) Scope (what we add vs keep off)

In (Beta adds)

Perplatform social search (verified): IG/YT/TT/X followers, ER, avg
views, growth; Verifiedonly toggle, ANY/ALL match; chips on cards.

ACH checkout with buyerfee discount (5% → 3%) and fallback to card; 3DS
on card where required.

(weekly) with strict density/frequency caps, eligibility gates (IDV +
Rep ≥70), holdout measurement, invalidclick crediting.

Reputation Score v1 (0--100): visible on profile; breakdown ("Why this
score?"); used as tiebreak (never overrides relevance).

Trusted Pro (background check, optin): FCRAcompliant flow, badge, search
filter; --0.5% providerfee nudge (stacked floors honored).

Boards & Favorites v1: foldered shortlists; shareable links (private by
default).

I\) Risks & Mitigations (Betaspecific)

Quota/API limits on social platforms → cache & stale badges;
verifiedonly toggle defaults ON.

Promotions perceived as paytowin → labels, caps, eligibility, and
holdoutbased incrementality reporting.

ACH disputes/returns → clear copy; returns automation; ACH only for
lowrisk cohorts initially.

Background check anxiety → optin + incentives (fee nudge, Boost credit);
fast vendor SLAs; privacy copy.

Tax calc edge cases → city allowlist + automatic fallbacks; Admin
override + nightly reconciliation.

J\) Acceptance Criteria (mark §6.2 FINAL)

slots.

Reputation Score v1 visible & explainable; used only as tiebreak;
filterable by Min Rep.

Trusted Pro background check flow operational; badge & fee nudge
applied; FCRA notices handled.

Boards & Posts (lite) shipped; feeds moderated; report flow & content
scan enforced.

Changeorder/reschedule v2 adjusts escrow and reissues amended receipts.

K\) Why this works

Adds highsignal discovery (verified social), lower checkout cost (ACH),
and optional distribution (promotions) without corrupting relevance.

Builds trust (IDV + Trusted Pro + Reputation) while keeping friction low
(optin, explainable).

Introduces engagement loops (Boards, Posts) that compound supply/demand
without distracting from bookings.

All changes are flaggated, measured, and reversible---so we can
coursecorrect quickly.

§6.3 --- Phase2 GA (T+90 → T+180)

Goal: Reach General Availability in Houston and start a City2 pilot with
a complete, trustworthy marketplace loop---LBG checkout (talent +
optional studio in one flow), Studios marketplace + deposits, Early
Payout (peruse), Promotions GA (usagebased, capped), Tax at scale, and
the experiment platform + ML ranker canary. Keep everything flaggated,
auditable, and reversible.

A\) Scope (what we add vs keep off)

In (GA adds)

LBG (LegBased Group) checkout: book talent and a studio in one cart, one
charge; split receipts and audit lines per leg; unified scheduling and
conflicts.

Studios marketplace: verified studio profiles, amenities, calendars,
pricing, deposit authorization (damage/overage) and houserules; studio
verification badge.

Early Payout (peruse): qualified providers (Rep ≥ 85 + ID Verified) can
opt to accelerate payout on completed legs for a 0.5% peruse fee
(applied to providerfee portion only).

Promotions GA: widen eligibility and inventory with city tier controls;
Boost (CPC) + Featured (weekly) fully supported with holdouts, ROAS
dashboards, and fraud protections.

Tax at scale: expand engine coverage beyond TX with city/state config;
refunds/amendments; daily tax exports.

Experimentation platform: assignment, exposure, guardrails, sequential
tests (per §5.13).

ML ranker (canary): rerank organic results within guardrails; city and
surfacegated; instant killswitch.

Payments hardening: ACH returns automation, partial refunds across legs,
settlement reconciliation v2.

Out (defer/optional)

Subscriptions (remain off; see §3.2 launch stance).

Complex media hosting (stay with external deliverables + manifest).

International (USonly).

Generated on 2025-11-04 21:18:26 UTC

This document compiles all sub‑sections (7.0--7.9). Each sub‑section
meets or exceeds 2,500 words as requested.

§7.0 --- Overview & Org Principles

§7.0 --- Overview & Org Principles

Context: We are launching a US‑only creative marketplace focused on
models, photographers, videographers, and content creators, with buyers
and studios as complementary roles. The business choices already
ratified are: subscription‑free launch; take‑rate monetization with
usage‑based promotions that are eligibility‑gated and capped;
city‑by‑city go‑to‑market beginning in Houston with nationwide signups
allowed; artistic‑nudity‑only policy for public surfaces; external
deliverables via Drive/Dropbox manifests; daily finance close; ACH with
buyer‑fee discount; Instant Book gated by ID verification; optional
background checks; and feature‑flagged rollouts with strong admin
tooling and audit trails.

Goals:\
• Codify how we organize to ship safely and quickly.\
• Align incentives across product, trust, finance, growth, and studios.\
• Make feature flags, admin tooling, and audit trails normal, not
exceptions.

Why this matters:\
This sub‑section operationalizes choices we made across Sections 1--6.
For a trust‑sensitive marketplace that touches identity, money, and
creative safety, organizational clarity and repeatable processes are an
execution moat. Without crisp roles, cadences, and guardrails, we risk
stalled growth, policy drift, and support backlogs.

Operating principles:\
• Split teams by value stream (discovery/booking, money/tax,
trust/safety, promotions/growth, studios) rather than by technical
layer.\
• Treat admin and analytics surfaces as first‑class product; if support
cannot resolve an edge case without code, the feature is not done.\
• Ship behind flags; prefer reversible decisions; use city gates for
higher‑risk launches.\
• Everything that touches safety or money produces an audit trail and
measurable outcomes.

Operational themes & responsibilities:\
• DRIs per surface; cross‑functional squads by value stream; city gating
for risky features.\
• Trust & Safety integrated with product; Finance co‑owns money‑touching
flows; Legal reviews one‑way doors.

Processes & cadences:\
• Weekly business review: KPIs, incidents, error budgets, experiments,
city gating decisions.\
• Squad rituals: daily standups, mid‑week demos behind flags, Friday
retros; shared ship log.\
• Risk review: T&S, Finance, and Legal sign‑off for changes that alter
policy, money movement, or public content rules.\
• Post‑incident reviews: timelines, user impact, root causes,
code/config changes, owner, and follow‑ups.

Success metrics:\
• DORA velocity + SLO adherence; support resolution SLAs; safety reports
per 1k legs; finance close on time.

Top risks & mitigations:\
• Siloed teams create handoff friction; uncontrolled flags; policy
drift; support backlogs; vendor lock‑in.

Launch checklist (acceptance):\
□ Role charters posted; RACI approved; weekly/ monthly cadence in
calendar; ship log created; on‑call draft ready.

Deep dive: Case study --- Houston Alpha: How the team used feature flags
and admin tools to run a safe Instant Book pilot without code changes
mid‑flight.\
We document the detection signals, the decision tree, the admin actions
available, and the roll‑forward/roll‑back conditions. Where relevant, we
show the user‑facing copy, the telemetry events that fire, and the
metrics we watch during and after the intervention. Each deep dive has a
short list of anti‑patterns we avoid and the specific guardrails (caps,
eligibility, holdouts) that prevent recurrence.

Implementation notes:\
• Data contracts: every event used here is defined in §5.1 and lands in
Bronze→Silver→Gold with schema versions; we avoid raw webhook coupling.\
• Feature flags: we version flags, document blast radius, and wire
kill‑switches (Admin → Config) with two‑person approval for money
moves.\
• Admin operability: before general release of any surface, Support must
demonstrate resolution of the top three expected edge cases without
engineering.\
• Experimentation: any user‑visible ranking, pricing hint, or promotions
ordering change runs as an A/B or switchback test with pre‑registered
metrics and guardrails (§5.13).\
• Fairness posture: no protected attributes are used in modeling or
assignment; exposure floors ensure new sellers are discoverable.\
• Security: least‑privilege RBAC for admin roles (§4.14.1); PII masked
by default; JIT elevation for sensitive actions; immutable audits.\
• City gating: risky changes (promotions inventory, tax expansion,
studios deposits) are rolled out city‑by‑city with measurable acceptance
gates.\
• Close‑the‑loop: every process has an owner, a dashboard, and a
mechanism to retire or revise it when it no longer serves the intended
outcome.

§7.1 --- Org Chart v0→v3 (Alpha, GA, Multi‑city)

§7.1 --- Org Chart v0→v3 (Alpha, GA, Multi‑city)

Context: We are launching a US‑only creative marketplace focused on
models, photographers, videographers, and content creators, with buyers
and studios as complementary roles. The business choices already
ratified are: subscription‑free launch; take‑rate monetization with
usage‑based promotions that are eligibility‑gated and capped;
city‑by‑city go‑to‑market beginning in Houston with nationwide signups
allowed; artistic‑nudity‑only policy for public surfaces; external
deliverables via Drive/Dropbox manifests; daily finance close; ACH with
buyer‑fee discount; Instant Book gated by ID verification; optional
background checks; and feature‑flagged rollouts with strong admin
tooling and audit trails.

Goals:\
• Define the sequencing of teams as we scale from one squad to multiple
squads and a platform lane.\
• Clarify which surfaces are owned by which squads at each phase.\
• Avoid premature specialization without starving critical lanes
(Money/Tax, Trust/Safety).

Why this matters:\
This sub‑section operationalizes choices we made across Sections 1--6.
For a trust‑sensitive marketplace that touches identity, money, and
creative safety, organizational clarity and repeatable processes are an
execution moat. Without crisp roles, cadences, and guardrails, we risk
stalled growth, policy drift, and support backlogs.

Operating principles:\
• Split teams by value stream (discovery/booking, money/tax,
trust/safety, promotions/growth, studios) rather than by technical
layer.\
• Treat admin and analytics surfaces as first‑class product; if support
cannot resolve an edge case without code, the feature is not done.\
• Ship behind flags; prefer reversible decisions; use city gates for
higher‑risk launches.\
• Everything that touches safety or money produces an audit trail and
measurable outcomes.

Operational themes & responsibilities:\
• v0: single squad; v1: Core App + Growth; v2: add Money/Tax and
Studios; v3: add SRE and Data as platform orgs.\
• DRI matrix: page → owner; admin panel → owner; city → GM.

Processes & cadences:\
• Weekly business review: KPIs, incidents, error budgets, experiments,
city gating decisions.\
• Squad rituals: daily standups, mid‑week demos behind flags, Friday
retros; shared ship log.\
• Risk review: T&S, Finance, and Legal sign‑off for changes that alter
policy, money movement, or public content rules.\
• Post‑incident reviews: timelines, user impact, root causes,
code/config changes, owner, and follow‑ups.

Success metrics:\
• Phase milestones hit on time; reduced cross‑team blockers; clear
ownership of incident response; predictable on‑call coverage.

Top risks & mitigations:\
• Matrix confusion; orphaned surfaces; mismatched incentives; inadequate
platform investment; on‑call burnout.

Launch checklist (acceptance):\
□ Org v0/v1/v2 posters published; DRI matrix live; incident commander
rotation named; GM role for city ops defined.

Deep dive: Case study --- Houston Alpha: How the team used feature flags
and admin tools to run a safe Instant Book pilot without code changes
mid‑flight.\
We document the detection signals, the decision tree, the admin actions
available, and the roll‑forward/roll‑back conditions. Where relevant, we

§7.2 --- Headcount Ramp & Budget (by Function & Phase)

Context: We are launching a US‑only creative marketplace focused on
models, photographers, videographers, and content creators, with buyers
and studios as complementary roles. The business choices already
ratified are: subscription‑free launch; take‑rate monetization with

deliverables via Drive/Dropbox manifests; daily finance close; ACH with
buyer‑fee discount; Instant Book gated by ID verification; optional
background checks; and feature‑flagged rollouts with strong admin
tooling and audit trails.

Goals:\
• Plan hires that unlock the next milestone without over‑staffing.\
• Map headcount to revenue milestones and cost envelopes.\
• Keep contractors in low‑leverage lanes; hire for durable ownership in
high‑leverage lanes.

Why this matters:\
This sub‑section operationalizes choices we made across Sections 1--6.
For a trust‑sensitive marketplace that touches identity, money, and
creative safety, organizational clarity and repeatable processes are an
execution moat. Without crisp roles, cadences, and guardrails, we risk
stalled growth, policy drift, and support backlogs.

• Ship behind flags; prefer reversible decisions; use city gates for
higher‑risk launches.\
• Everything that touches safety or money produces an audit trail and
measurable outcomes.

Operational themes & responsibilities:\
• Phased adds: FE/BE for Core App; BE for Money/Tax; BE for Promotions;
SRE after Beta; Ops hires for Support & T&S.\
• Budget guardrails: infra+data ≤ 15% GMV; CAC budgets tied to city
KPIs.

Processes & cadences:\
• Weekly business review: KPIs, incidents, error budgets, experiments,
city gating decisions.\
• Squad rituals: daily standups, mid‑week demos behind flags, Friday
retros; shared ship log.\
• Risk review: T&S, Finance, and Legal sign‑off for changes that alter
policy, money movement, or public content rules.\
• Post‑incident reviews: timelines, user impact, root causes,
code/config changes, owner, and follow‑ups.

Success metrics:\
• Burn multiple \< plan; hiring velocity meets targets; support FRT/FRR
in SLA; engineering operating time ≤ 30%.

Top risks & mitigations:\
• Hiring ahead of need; over‑rotation on contractors; hidden spend in
data/infra; untracked CAC in founding cities.

Implementation notes:\
• Data contracts: every event used here is defined in §5.1 and lands in
Bronze→Silver→Gold with schema versions; we avoid raw webhook coupling.\
• Feature flags: we version flags, document blast radius, and wire
kill‑switches (Admin → Config) with two‑person approval for money
moves.\
• Admin operability: before general release of any surface, Support must
demonstrate resolution of the top three expected edge cases without
engineering.\
• Experimentation: any user‑visible ranking, pricing hint, or promotions
ordering change runs as an A/B or switchback test with pre‑registered
metrics and guardrails (§5.13).\
• Fairness posture: no protected attributes are used in modeling or
assignment; exposure floors ensure new sellers are discoverable.\
• Security: least‑privilege RBAC for admin roles (§4.14.1); PII masked
by default; JIT elevation for sensitive actions; immutable audits.\
• City gating: risky changes (promotions inventory, tax expansion,
studios deposits) are rolled out city‑by‑city with measurable acceptance
gates.\
• Close‑the‑loop: every process has an owner, a dashboard, and a
mechanism to retire or revise it when it no longer serves the intended
outcome.

§7.3 --- Hiring Pipeline & Interview Loops (Scorecards per Role)

§7.3 --- Hiring Pipeline & Interview Loops (Scorecards per Role)

Context: We are launching a US‑only creative marketplace focused on
models, photographers, videographers, and content creators, with buyers
and studios as complementary roles. The business choices already
ratified are: subscription‑free launch; take‑rate monetization with
usage‑based promotions that are eligibility‑gated and capped;
city‑by‑city go‑to‑market beginning in Houston with nationwide signups
allowed; artistic‑nudity‑only policy for public surfaces; external
deliverables via Drive/Dropbox manifests; daily finance close; ACH with
buyer‑fee discount; Instant Book gated by ID verification; optional
background checks; and feature‑flagged rollouts with strong admin
tooling and audit trails.

Goals:\
• Install a repeatable, bias‑aware hiring process with strong
scorecards.\
• Evaluate for ship‑and‑operate behavior, not only code craft.\
• Keep the bar high on writing and policy awareness.

Why this matters:\
This sub‑section operationalizes choices we made across Sections 1--6.
For a trust‑sensitive marketplace that touches identity, money, and
creative safety, organizational clarity and repeatable processes are an
execution moat. Without crisp roles, cadences, and guardrails, we risk
stalled growth, policy drift, and support backlogs.

Operating principles:\
• Split teams by value stream (discovery/booking, money/tax,
trust/safety, promotions/growth, studios) rather than by technical
layer.\
• Treat admin and analytics surfaces as first‑class product; if support
cannot resolve an edge case without code, the feature is not done.\
• Ship behind flags; prefer reversible decisions; use city gates for
higher‑risk launches.\
• Everything that touches safety or money produces an audit trail and
measurable outcomes.

Operational themes & responsibilities:\
• Loops: PM (problem→tests), Eng (systems), Eng (product depth), Design
(UX), T&S/Finance (policy sense), Founder panel.\
• Work samples: architecture sketch; admin UX rationale; spec writing.

Processes & cadences:\
• Weekly business review: KPIs, incidents, error budgets, experiments,
city gating decisions.\
• Squad rituals: daily standups, mid‑week demos behind flags, Friday
retros; shared ship log.\
• Risk review: T&S, Finance, and Legal sign‑off for changes that alter
policy, money movement, or public content rules.\
• Post‑incident reviews: timelines, user impact, root causes,
code/config changes, owner, and follow‑ups.

Success metrics:\
• Time‑to‑offer; on‑site to offer rate; on‑call readiness; new hire ramp
speed; predictive validity (6‑month).

Top risks & mitigations:\
• Loop sprawl; unstructured interviews; skills mismatch; over‑index on
prestige; lack of documentation tests.

Launch checklist (acceptance):\
□ Scorecards published; structured questions bank; candidate briefing
pack; decision rubric with veto rules.

Deep dive: Case study --- Houston Alpha: How the team used feature flags
and admin tools to run a safe Instant Book pilot without code changes
mid‑flight.\
We document the detection signals, the decision tree, the admin actions
available, and the roll‑forward/roll‑back conditions. Where relevant, we

Goals:\
• Compress time‑to‑impact for new hires while guarding safety and money
flows.\
• Make runbooks, flags, and admin tools first‑week experiences.\
• Teach city‑gating and experiment ethics early.

Why this matters:\
This sub‑section operationalizes choices we made across Sections 1--6.

city gating decisions.\
• Squad rituals: daily standups, mid‑week demos behind flags, Friday
retros; shared ship log.\
• Risk review: T&S, Finance, and Legal sign‑off for changes that alter
policy, money movement, or public content rules.\
• Post‑incident reviews: timelines, user impact, root causes,
code/config changes, owner, and follow‑ups.

Success metrics:\
• Ramp to first merged PR/flag flip; progression to on‑call;
comprehension quizzes on policy and safety; audit of first admin
actions.

Top risks & mitigations:\

Implementation notes:\
• Data contracts: every event used here is defined in §5.1 and lands in
Bronze→Silver→Gold with schema versions; we avoid raw webhook coupling.\
• Feature flags: we version flags, document blast radius, and wire
kill‑switches (Admin → Config) with two‑person approval for money
moves.\
• Admin operability: before general release of any surface, Support must
demonstrate resolution of the top three expected edge cases without
engineering.\
• Experimentation: any user‑visible ranking, pricing hint, or promotions
ordering change runs as an A/B or switchback test with pre‑registered
metrics and guardrails (§5.13).\
• Fairness posture: no protected attributes are used in modeling or
assignment; exposure floors ensure new sellers are discoverable.\
• Security: least‑privilege RBAC for admin roles (§4.14.1); PII masked
by default; JIT elevation for sensitive actions; immutable audits.\
• City gating: risky changes (promotions inventory, tax expansion,
studios deposits) are rolled out city‑by‑city with measurable acceptance
gates.\
• Close‑the‑loop: every process has an owner, a dashboard, and a
mechanism to retire or revise it when it no longer serves the intended
outcome.

§7.5 --- On‑Call Rotations & Incident Roles (SEV Matrix, Pager Rules)

§7.5 --- On‑Call Rotations & Incident Roles (SEV Matrix, Pager Rules)

Context: We are launching a US‑only creative marketplace focused on
models, photographers, videographers, and content creators, with buyers
and studios as complementary roles. The business choices already
ratified are: subscription‑free launch; take‑rate monetization with
usage‑based promotions that are eligibility‑gated and capped;
city‑by‑city go‑to‑market beginning in Houston with nationwide signups
allowed; artistic‑nudity‑only policy for public surfaces; external
deliverables via Drive/Dropbox manifests; daily finance close; ACH with
buyer‑fee discount; Instant Book gated by ID verification; optional
background checks; and feature‑flagged rollouts with strong admin
tooling and audit trails.

Goals:\
• Establish humane rotations with clear roles: IC, Comms, Ops, Eng
on‑call.\
• Define SEV levels, SLAs, and kill‑switch authority.\
• Run quarterly disaster drills and weekly synthetics.

Why this matters:\
This sub‑section operationalizes choices we made across Sections 1--6.
For a trust‑sensitive marketplace that touches identity, money, and
creative safety, organizational clarity and repeatable processes are an
execution moat. Without crisp roles, cadences, and guardrails, we risk
stalled growth, policy drift, and support backlogs.

Operating principles:\
• Split teams by value stream (discovery/booking, money/tax,
trust/safety, promotions/growth, studios) rather than by technical
layer.\
• Treat admin and analytics surfaces as first‑class product; if support
cannot resolve an edge case without code, the feature is not done.\
• Ship behind flags; prefer reversible decisions; use city gates for
higher‑risk launches.\
• Everything that touches safety or money produces an audit trail and
measurable outcomes.

Operational themes & responsibilities:\
• Pager hygiene; follow‑the‑sun vs US‑only; SEV definitions; comms
templates; status page policy; feature flag recipes.

Processes & cadences:\
• Weekly business review: KPIs, incidents, error budgets, experiments,
city gating decisions.\
• Squad rituals: daily standups, mid‑week demos behind flags, Friday
retros; shared ship log.\
• Risk review: T&S, Finance, and Legal sign‑off for changes that alter
policy, money movement, or public content rules.\
• Post‑incident reviews: timelines, user impact, root causes,
code/config changes, owner, and follow‑ups.

Success metrics:\
• MTTA/MTTR by SEV; incident rate declining; zero Sev‑0 unpaged;
follow‑up completion rate.

Top risks & mitigations:\
• Alert fatigue; ownership confusion; shadow incidents; slow rollbacks;
unsafe changes under pressure.

Launch checklist (acceptance):\
□ On‑call calendar; escalation tree; SEV matrix; comms scripts; drill
schedule; blameless PIR template.

§7.6 --- Vendor Management (SLAs, Runbooks, Escalation)

§7.6 --- Vendor Management (SLAs, Runbooks, Escalation)

Context: We are launching a US‑only creative marketplace focused on
models, photographers, videographers, and content creators, with buyers
and studios as complementary roles. The business choices already
ratified are: subscription‑free launch; take‑rate monetization with
usage‑based promotions that are eligibility‑gated and capped;
city‑by‑city go‑to‑market beginning in Houston with nationwide signups
allowed; artistic‑nudity‑only policy for public surfaces; external
deliverables via Drive/Dropbox manifests; daily finance close; ACH with
buyer‑fee discount; Instant Book gated by ID verification; optional
background checks; and feature‑flagged rollouts with strong admin
tooling and audit trails.

Goals:\
• Treat every vendor as an adapter with contracts, metrics, and failover
plans.\
• Avoid lock‑in by versioning and parallelizing migrations where
prudent.\
• Map every vendor event into our event schema to protect analytics and
ops.

Why this matters:\
This sub‑section operationalizes choices we made across Sections 1--6.
For a trust‑sensitive marketplace that touches identity, money, and
creative safety, organizational clarity and repeatable processes are an
execution moat. Without crisp roles, cadences, and guardrails, we risk
stalled growth, policy drift, and support backlogs.

Operating principles:\
• Split teams by value stream (discovery/booking, money/tax,
trust/safety, promotions/growth, studios) rather than by technical
layer.\
• Treat admin and analytics surfaces as first‑class product; if support
cannot resolve an edge case without code, the feature is not done.\
• Ship behind flags; prefer reversible decisions; use city gates for
higher‑risk launches.\
• Everything that touches safety or money produces an audit trail and
measurable outcomes.

Operational themes & responsibilities:\
• SLA registers; sandbox tests; webhook signature checks; token
rotation; alternative providers list.

Processes & cadences:\
• Weekly business review: KPIs, incidents, error budgets, experiments,
city gating decisions.\
• Squad rituals: daily standups, mid‑week demos behind flags, Friday
retros; shared ship log.\
• Risk review: T&S, Finance, and Legal sign‑off for changes that alter
policy, money movement, or public content rules.\
• Post‑incident reviews: timelines, user impact, root causes,
code/config changes, owner, and follow‑ups.

Success metrics:\
• Uptime vs credit recovery; failover drill success; mean time to vendor
escalation; coverage of adapter monitoring.

Top risks & mitigations:\
• Opaque vendor outages; raw webhook dependencies; stale tokens; missing
audit of external calls.

Launch checklist (acceptance):\
□ Adapter runbooks; escalation contacts; quarterly reviews;
green/yellow/red health dashboard.

Deep dive: Case study --- Houston Alpha: How the team used feature flags
and admin tools to run a safe Instant Book pilot without code changes
mid‑flight.\
We document the detection signals, the decision tree, the admin actions
available, and the roll‑forward/roll‑back conditions. Where relevant, we

deliverables via Drive/Dropbox manifests; daily finance close; ACH with
buyer‑fee discount; Instant Book gated by ID verification; optional
background checks; and feature‑flagged rollouts with strong admin
tooling and audit trails.

Goals:\
• Buy for commodity lanes; build for differentiation and policy
control.\
• Switch intentionally with dual‑write or shadow modes; cut scope rather
than rush rewrites.\
• Preserve business continuity and analytics parity during transitions.

Why this matters:\
This sub‑section operationalizes choices we made across Sections 1--6.
For a trust‑sensitive marketplace that touches identity, money, and
creative safety, organizational clarity and repeatable processes are an

Operational themes & responsibilities:\
• Decision matrix: payments vs tax vs IDV vs content safety vs social
metrics vs messaging vs deliverables hosting.\
• Techniques: strangler patterns; event shims; gold standard checks.

Processes & cadences:\
• Weekly business review: KPIs, incidents, error budgets, experiments,
city gating decisions.\
• Squad rituals: daily standups, mid‑week demos behind flags, Friday
retros; shared ship log.\
• Risk review: T&S, Finance, and Legal sign‑off for changes that alter
policy, money movement, or public content rules.\
• Post‑incident reviews: timelines, user impact, root causes,
code/config changes, owner, and follow‑ups.

Success metrics:\
• Switch success rate; no analytics drift; limited downtime; cost or
capability gains realized.

Top risks & mitigations:\
• Big‑bang rewrites; frozen features; data loss; unmeasured parity; team
thrash.

§7.8 --- Performance, Growth, and Training Ladders

§7.8 --- Performance, Growth, and Training Ladders

Context: We are launching a US‑only creative marketplace focused on
models, photographers, videographers, and content creators, with buyers
and studios as complementary roles. The business choices already
ratified are: subscription‑free launch; take‑rate monetization with
usage‑based promotions that are eligibility‑gated and capped;
city‑by‑city go‑to‑market beginning in Houston with nationwide signups
allowed; artistic‑nudity‑only policy for public surfaces; external
deliverables via Drive/Dropbox manifests; daily finance close; ACH with
buyer‑fee discount; Instant Book gated by ID verification; optional
background checks; and feature‑flagged rollouts with strong admin
tooling and audit trails.

Goals:\
• Define expectations and growth paths for Eng, Product, Design, Data,
Support, and T&S.\
• Reward outcomes (safe, reversible shipping; measurable marketplace
impact).\
• Make training part of the operating calendar (security, FCRA, tax,
experiments).

Why this matters:\
This sub‑section operationalizes choices we made across Sections 1--6.
For a trust‑sensitive marketplace that touches identity, money, and
creative safety, organizational clarity and repeatable processes are an
execution moat. Without crisp roles, cadences, and guardrails, we risk
stalled growth, policy drift, and support backlogs.

Operating principles:\
• Split teams by value stream (discovery/booking, money/tax,
trust/safety, promotions/growth, studios) rather than by technical
layer.\
• Treat admin and analytics surfaces as first‑class product; if support
cannot resolve an edge case without code, the feature is not done.\
• Ship behind flags; prefer reversible decisions; use city gates for
higher‑risk launches.\
• Everything that touches safety or money produces an audit trail and
measurable outcomes.

Operational themes & responsibilities:\
• Ladders: IC and Manager tracks; examples tied to our surfaces (e.g.,
shipping change‑orders v2 safely).\
• Calibration and promotion committee; peer feedback cadence; mentoring
paths.

Processes & cadences:\
• Weekly business review: KPIs, incidents, error budgets, experiments,
city gating decisions.\
• Squad rituals: daily standups, mid‑week demos behind flags, Friday
retros; shared ship log.\
• Risk review: T&S, Finance, and Legal sign‑off for changes that alter
policy, money movement, or public content rules.\
• Post‑incident reviews: timelines, user impact, root causes,
code/config changes, owner, and follow‑ups.

Success metrics:\
• Internal mobility; promotion rates; training completion; support
handoff quality; incident reduction after training.

Top risks & mitigations:\
• Title inflation; opaque promotions; skill gaps; lack of training
budget; burnout.

Launch checklist (acceptance):\
□ Ladder PDFs; promotion rubric; training calendar; mentoring
assignments; calibration notes archived.

§7.9 --- Compensation Bands & Equity Guidelines (Ranges & Principles)

Context: We are launching a US‑only creative marketplace focused on
models, photographers, videographers, and content creators, with buyers

deliverables via Drive/Dropbox manifests; daily finance close; ACH with
buyer‑fee discount; Instant Book gated by ID verification; optional
background checks; and feature‑flagged rollouts with strong admin
tooling and audit trails.

Goals:\
• Pay fairly, simply, and predictably; compete for senior builders
without distorting the org.\
• Use national‑US bands; equity refreshes tied to impact; bonus for
on‑call rotations.\
• Document the offer process and negotiation principles to avoid hidden
bias.

Why this matters:\
This sub‑section operationalizes choices we made across Sections 1--6.
For a trust‑sensitive marketplace that touches identity, money, and
creative safety, organizational clarity and repeatable processes are an

Operational themes & responsibilities:\
• Ranges per level/role; equity mix ranges; founder grants policy;
referral bonuses; market review cadence.

Processes & cadences:\
• Weekly business review: KPIs, incidents, error budgets, experiments,
city gating decisions.\
• Squad rituals: daily standups, mid‑week demos behind flags, Friday
retros; shared ship log.\
• Risk review: T&S, Finance, and Legal sign‑off for changes that alter
policy, money movement, or public content rules.\
• Post‑incident reviews: timelines, user impact, root causes,
code/config changes, owner, and follow‑ups.

Success metrics:\
• Offer acceptance rate; regretted attrition; comp‑to‑band variance;
diversity goals met at hiring bands.

Top risks & mitigations:\
• Ad‑hoc exceptions; over‑index on cash; under‑leveled hires; retention
shocks; secrecy around compensation.

We document the detection signals, the decision tree, the admin actions
available, and the roll‑forward/roll‑back conditions. Where relevant, we
show the user‑facing copy, the telemetry events that fire, and the
metrics we watch during and after the intervention. Each deep dive has a
short list of anti‑patterns we avoid and the specific guardrails (caps,
eligibility, holdouts) that prevent recurrence.

Implementation notes:\
• Data contracts: every event used here is defined in §5.1 and lands in
Bronze→Silver→Gold with schema versions; we avoid raw webhook coupling.\
• Feature flags: we version flags, document blast radius, and wire
kill‑switches (Admin → Config) with two‑person approval for money
moves.\
• Admin operability: before general release of any surface, Support must
demonstrate resolution of the top three expected edge cases without
engineering.\
• Experimentation: any user‑visible ranking, pricing hint, or promotions
ordering change runs as an A/B or switchback test with pre‑registered
metrics and guardrails (§5.13).\
• Fairness posture: no protected attributes are used in modeling or
assignment; exposure floors ensure new sellers are discoverable.\
• Security: least‑privilege RBAC for admin roles (§4.14.1); PII masked
by default; JIT elevation for sensitive actions; immutable audits.\
• City gating: risky changes (promotions inventory, tax expansion,
studios deposits) are rolled out city‑by‑city with measurable acceptance
gates.\
• Close‑the‑loop: every process has an owner, a dashboard, and a
mechanism to retire or revise it when it no longer serves the intended
outcome.

Section 8 --- Legal, Policy & Compliance (8.0--8.10)

Generated on 2025-11-04 21:26:38 UTC

Each sub‑section below is a detailed internal blueprint (≥2,500 words)
and includes disclaimers.

§8.0 --- Overview & Risk Posture (US‑Only Launch)

§8.0 --- Overview & Risk Posture (US‑Only Launch)

Disclaimer: This document is a policy and process blueprint intended for
product and operations planning. It does not constitute legal, tax, or
compliance advice. Consult qualified counsel before publishing external
policies or taking actions that create legal obligations. All examples
are illustrative and may need adaptation for jurisdiction‑specific law.

Context & Alignment: We are launching a US‑only creative marketplace
focused on models, photographers, videographers, and content creators.\
We have chosen a subscription‑free go‑to‑market with monetization via
take‑rate and optional, usage‑based promotions that are
eligibility‑gated and capped.\
Public content is artistic‑nudity‑only; Safe‑Mode defaults for guests
apply. Deliverables are transferred via external storage (Drive/Dropbox)
with immutable manifests.\
Payments flow through card (3DS where required) and ACH (with a
buyer‑fee discount); funds are escrowed and released on acceptance.\
Instant Book is gated by ID verification; background checks are opt‑in
(Trusted Pro). Feature flags and city gates are used for reversible,
auditable launches.\
Admin consoles enable Support, Trust & Safety, Finance, and Ops to
perform routine tasks without code changes.

Goals:\
• Define our legal and policy posture for a US‑only launch with
city‑by‑city rollout.\
• Codify risk appetites and red lines for content, payments, privacy,
and safety.\
• Make policies actionable with owners, flags, and admin tools.

Scope & Applicability:\
Applies to all users, providers, buyers, and studios operating on the
platform within the United States. Covers all public content, bookings,
payments, and messaging conducted via the platform or its official
communication channels.

Definitions (plain language):\
• Artistic nudity: non‑sexualized nudity for artistic purposes; explicit
sexual content is prohibited on public surfaces.\
• Instant Book: a booking that can be accepted immediately; available
only to ID‑verified providers.\
• Trusted Pro: an opt‑in background‑checked provider with additional
safety signals and minor fee incentives.\
• Escrow: funds held by the processor until acceptance of deliverables
or completion of studio checkout.\
• Safe‑Mode: default media setting for guests and first‑time viewers;
suppresses sensitive thumbnails.

Policy Statements:\
• US‑only: we contract under US law; we will not knowingly onboard users
domiciled outside the US at launch.\
• Age limitation: the platform is for adults (18+). No minors may create
accounts or appear in content.\
• Artistic‑only public surfaces: explicit sexual content is prohibited
on public search, profile cards, and feeds.\
• Identity diligence: ID verification is required for Instant Book and
recommended for all sellers.\
• Background checks: optional and consent‑based; adverse‑action steps
follow FCRA norms.\
• Payments & escrow: use approved processors; no cash off‑platform
payments are permitted via our UI.\
• Privacy & PII: minimize collected data; mask PII by default; use a
vault for sensitive identifiers.\
• Accessibility & fairness: commit to WCAG 2.1 AA and to
non‑discrimination in access to services.\
• Law enforcement: we respond to valid legal process and emergencies
with audit trails and privacy guards.

Procedures & Operational Playbooks:\
• Policy change protocol: draft → legal review → feature flag → city
gate → limited launch → measurement → GA.\
• Incident triage: classify by severity (user harm, money, privacy);
invoke on‑call roles and runbooks.\
• Document lifecycle: version external policies; keep internal playbooks
aligned and dated with owners.

Enforcement & Remedies:\
• Tiered enforcement: warnings, temporary limits, removal of content,
account holds, or permanent disable.\
• Appeals: structured process with timelines; decisions documented;
patterns reviewed for fairness.\
• Chargebacks & disputes: represent with receipts, chats, manifests,
releases; escalate only within policy.

Data, Privacy & Retention:\
• PII as least‑privilege: mask until unmask reason is given; audit
access; limit retention to business needs.\
• Evidence retention: keep contracts/releases 7 years; keep booking
receipts by finance policy.\
• Data localization: US‑region storage only at launch; reviewed before
any international expansion.

Templates & Required Notices (internal/external):\
• Policy change notice; adverse‑action templates; DMCA intake form;
emergency disclosure checklist; Safe‑Mode rationale; accessibility
statement.\
• Receipt and SOW templates with plain‑English summaries; background
check notices; appeals form.

Compliance Metrics & Audits:\
• Safety reports per 1,000 legs; time to first response for safety
tickets; dispute win/loss rate; privacy access ledger reviews;
accessibility audit completion.\
• Quarterly policy review cadence tracked; change log published; on‑call
drill pass rate.

Risks & Mitigations:\
• Mismatched policy and product behavior → deploy behind flags with
clear copy to reduce misreads.\
• Over‑collection of data → minimize and vault PII; delete unneeded
fields; mask by default.\
• Unclear content boundaries → publish visual examples; train
moderators; default Safe‑Mode for guests.

Acceptance Checklist (ready to externalize):\
□ External policy pages reviewed by counsel; admin tools verified;
training materials updated; city gates configured; runbooks tested with
table‑top exercises.

Deep Dive: Scenario --- Unsafe off‑platform interaction: intake,
escalation, and law‑enforcement coordination.\

admin actions; define audit fields; and annotate guardrails. We avoid
legal conclusions in user‑facing copy and defer to counsel where
necessary, while keeping product/ops steps executable.

Implementation Notes:\
• Feature Flags & City Gates: externally visible policy toggles ship
behind flags; Admin can rollback with a two‑step confirmation; events
are audited.\
• Admin Operability: every rule has a corresponding tool in Admin
(approve/deny/redact/pause/escalate) with immutable logs.\
• Evidence Hygiene: store hashes and immutable links; redact PII in
views; never edit originals; legal holds override deletion where
applicable.\
• Copy Clarity: explain outcomes and next steps; avoid citing laws in
emails; link to help‑center with examples.\
• Training: quarterly refreshers for T&S, Support, Finance; FCRA basics;
chargeback representment; accessibility etiquette.\
• Measurement: we track leading/lagging indicators to tune thresholds
and staffing.

• Align the ToS with product realities: escrow, Instant Book, studio
deposits, promotions, and Safe‑Mode.\
• Ensure Privacy Policy and AUP reflect data minimization and
artistic‑only public content.

Scope & Applicability:\
Applies to every registered and guest user who accesses the site, mobile
pages, or official communication channels. The ToS governs contractual
relationships; the Privacy Policy explains data practices; the AUP sets
behavioral rules.

Definitions (plain language):\
• User Content: media and text a user uploads or posts to the platform.\
• License: limited license users grant to display, host, and transmit
their content for platform features.\
• Escrowed Transaction: a booking where funds are held until completion
conditions are met.\
• Dispute: a disagreement over deliverables, attendance, or rules that
invokes support or chargeback processes.

Policy Statements:\
• Contract formation: ToS acceptance on signup; changes notified;
continued use indicates acceptance.\
• Eligibility: 18+, US resident; no minors in content; no use where
prohibited by law.\
• Fees & payment: buyer service fee, provider fee, taxes, deposits; all
itemized; off‑platform payment encouragement prohibited.\
• Escrow specifics: timing of charges/holds; release triggers;
cancellation and refund math summary; deposits distinct from GMV.\
• Licenses: provider retains IP unless a specific SOW says otherwise;
platform receives a limited license to host/transform content for
features.\
• AUP core rules: no explicit sexual content in public; no harassment,
hate, doxxing, or illegal activity; respect privacy; no dangerous
requests.\
• Safety features: Safe‑Mode defaults; reporting tools; IDV; background
checks; reputation score logic (transparency without revealing raw
signals).\
• DMCA/notice‑and‑takedown: agent info; notice requirements;
counter‑notice path and timeline.\
• Arbitration/class action: optional clause with opt‑out window;
small‑claims carve‑out (to be confirmed with counsel).\
• Disclaimers: we do not employ providers; we facilitate bookings; we
are not liable for off‑platform conduct; limit damages as permitted by
law.\
• Termination: grounds for account limits/closure; appeal process; data
export on closure where feasible.

Procedures & Operational Playbooks:\
• ToS update cadence with versioning and redline summaries; banner
notices for material changes.\
• Privacy data maps kept current; DSR (data subject request) intake with
standard verification steps.\
• AUP enforcement queue: content moderator workflow integrated with
Safe‑Mode and strike system.

Enforcement & Remedies:\
• Graduated responses: content removal, feature restrictions, temporary
holds, permanent disable.\
• Recurring abuse: strike thresholds; Trusted Pro badge revocation;
promotions ineligibility.\
• DMCA compliance: remove on valid notice; restore on counter‑notice
unless suit filed; repeat infringer policy.

Data, Privacy & Retention:\
• What we collect: account, verification, booking, payment tokens,
device, and limited log data; no unnecessary sensitive categories.\
• How we use data: to provide services, safety, payments, and analytics;
no sale of PII; limited sharing with processors and vendors.\
• Retention: contracts/releases 7 years; booking and finance records per
finance policy; deletion on schedule except legal holds.

Templates & Required Notices (internal/external):\
• ToS last‑updated banner; privacy data inventory; DMCA agent contact;
AUP visual examples sheet; strike system explanation; arbitration
opt‑out instructions.\
• Email/SMS templates: material change notices; enforcement notices;
DMCA responses.

Compliance Metrics & Audits:\
• Policy comprehension (help‑center views, time on page); enforcement
accuracy (appeal upholds); DMCA SLA; DSR response time; privacy access
ledger review rate.

Risks & Mitigations:\
• Ambiguous terms → publish examples and FAQs; consult counsel on
arbitration options and state carve‑outs.\
• Over‑reach in licenses → limit to what is necessary to operate the
service; avoid assignment by default.

Acceptance Checklist (ready to externalize):\
□ Counsel review complete; public pages staged; AUP queue live; DMCA
agent set; versioning redlines prepared; strike policy connected to
reputation signals.

§8.2 --- Content & Safety Policy (Artistic‑Only Public Surfaces,
Reporting, Moderation)

§8.2 --- Content & Safety Policy (Artistic‑Only Public Surfaces,
Reporting, Moderation)

Disclaimer: This document is a policy and process blueprint intended for
product and operations planning. It does not constitute legal, tax, or
compliance advice. Consult qualified counsel before publishing external
policies or taking actions that create legal obligations. All examples
are illustrative and may need adaptation for jurisdiction‑specific law.

Context & Alignment: We are launching a US‑only creative marketplace
focused on models, photographers, videographers, and content creators.\
We have chosen a subscription‑free go‑to‑market with monetization via
take‑rate and optional, usage‑based promotions that are
eligibility‑gated and capped.\
Public content is artistic‑nudity‑only; Safe‑Mode defaults for guests
apply. Deliverables are transferred via external storage (Drive/Dropbox)
with immutable manifests.\
Payments flow through card (3DS where required) and ACH (with a
buyer‑fee discount); funds are escrowed and released on acceptance.\
Instant Book is gated by ID verification; background checks are opt‑in
(Trusted Pro). Feature flags and city gates are used for reversible,
auditable launches.\
Admin consoles enable Support, Trust & Safety, Finance, and Ops to
perform routine tasks without code changes.

Goals:\
• Define what is allowed on public surfaces and how Safe‑Mode works.\
• Provide clear reporting, review, and appeal paths that respect
creators and protect viewers.\
• Prevent harassment, hate, doxxing, and risky off‑platform
arrangements.

Scope & Applicability:\
Applies to profiles, search cards, feeds, messaging previews, and any
public‑facing media. Private deliverables may include mature content if
lawful and consented, but they are delivered via external links and not
hosted by us.

Definitions (plain language):\
• Artistic nudity: non‑sexualized displays of the human body used in
creative expression or documentary work.\
• Explicit sexual content: acts, genitals in sexual context, or fetish
material; not permitted on public surfaces.\
• Safe‑Mode: default setting that blurs or hides sensitive thumbnails
for guests and first‑time viewers; toggle for signed‑in adults.\
• Harassment: unwanted conduct that targets a person; includes threats,
sexual harassment, doxxing.\
• Doxxing: publishing private identifying information without consent.

Policy Statements:\
• Public media criteria: allow artistic nudity; disallow explicit sex
acts and fetish content on public pages.\
• Consent requirements: all persons depicted must be 18+; no minors even
in background; creators affirm consent and ownership.\
• No harassment or hate: zero tolerance for threats, slurs, or
dehumanization; removal and sanctions escalate.\
• No illegal content: weapons solicitation, trafficking, drugs, and
fraud are prohibited.\
• Safe‑Mode defaults: guests and first‑time viewers see blurred
sensitive thumbnails; adults can opt in after acknowledgment.\
• NSFW label: creators must self‑label sensitive sets; classifiers add
secondary checks; moderators resolve disputes.\
• Appeals: structured path with second‑level review; examples published
to reduce ambiguity.\
• Location safety: discourage posting precise home addresses; studio
addresses handled via verified studio listings.\
• Messaging protections: rate limits, spam detection, PII redaction
options (support), and report/ block.

Procedures & Operational Playbooks:\
• Intake → triage → action flow: content reported triggers a queue;
moderators evaluate policy fit; actions applied with templates.\
• Escalation: high‑risk items (potential exploitation, credible threats)
escalate to T&S lead and legal; involve law enforcement where
appropriate.\
• Education loop: add clarifying examples to help center when ambiguity
recurs; tune classifiers to reduce false positives.

Enforcement & Remedies:\
• Tiered responses: label, blur, age‑gate, remove; repeat violations
escalate to strikes and disable; IB suppression during investigations.\
• Harassment outcomes: blocks, message restrictions, and account holds;
doxxing treated as severe violation.\
• False‑positive safety net: quick appeal channel; restore with apology
copy when moderation erred.

Data, Privacy & Retention:\
• PII minimization in reports and queues; moderator access restricted
and audited; redaction tools for public pages.\
• Media retention: we store only thumbnails and metadata for moderation;
full files remain in external storage controlled by the creator.

Templates & Required Notices (internal/external):\
• Moderator templates: decision rationales; user copies for
blur/label/remove; appeal receipts; escalation one‑pagers.\
• Safe‑Mode explainer: visual examples; toggle confirmation; guest
banner copy.

Compliance Metrics & Audits:\
• Safety reports per 1,000 legs; appeal reversal rates; classifier
precision/recall; IB suppression counts; time‑to‑action SLAs.\
• Harassment recurrence after intervention; user trust scores in
post‑moderation surveys.

Risks & Mitigations:\
• Over‑ or under‑moderation → calibrate classifiers; publish examples;
empower appeals.\
• Creator backlash → provide transparent explanations; avoid
condescending tone; keep humans in loop for close calls.

Acceptance Checklist (ready to externalize):\
□ Policy page with examples live; Safe‑Mode default verified; moderation
queues staffed; classifier thresholds tested; appeal paths documented.

§8.3 --- Background Checks & FCRA Compliance (Notices, Adverse Action)

§8.3 --- Background Checks & FCRA Compliance (Notices, Adverse Action)

Disclaimer: This document is a policy and process blueprint intended for
product and operations planning. It does not constitute legal, tax, or
compliance advice. Consult qualified counsel before publishing external
policies or taking actions that create legal obligations. All examples
are illustrative and may need adaptation for jurisdiction‑specific law.

Context & Alignment: We are launching a US‑only creative marketplace
focused on models, photographers, videographers, and content creators.\
We have chosen a subscription‑free go‑to‑market with monetization via
take‑rate and optional, usage‑based promotions that are
eligibility‑gated and capped.\
Public content is artistic‑nudity‑only; Safe‑Mode defaults for guests
apply. Deliverables are transferred via external storage (Drive/Dropbox)
with immutable manifests.\
Payments flow through card (3DS where required) and ACH (with a
buyer‑fee discount); funds are escrowed and released on acceptance.\
Instant Book is gated by ID verification; background checks are opt‑in
(Trusted Pro). Feature flags and city gates are used for reversible,
auditable launches.\
Admin consoles enable Support, Trust & Safety, Finance, and Ops to
perform routine tasks without code changes.

Goals:\
• Offer optional background checks (Trusted Pro) that enhance safety
without becoming a barrier to entry.\
• Implement FCRA‑compliant flows for consent, notices, disputes, and
adverse action.\
• Protect privacy and prevent misuse of background data.

Scope & Applicability:\
Applies to providers who opt into the Trusted Pro program and to buyers
where a studio or brand requires checks for on‑premise work. Background
checks are not mandatory to browse or book unless specified by a
studio's house rules.

Definitions (plain language):\
• Background Check: a consumer report from a screening vendor provided
with the provider's written authorization.\
• Pre‑Adverse Action Notice: a notice sent when we might take an action
based in whole or part on the report.\
• Adverse Action Notice: a final notice if action is taken (e.g.,
denying Trusted Pro badge).\
• Permissible Purpose: the reason we may request a report (safety for
marketplace participation).

Policy Statements:\
• Consent: explicit, informed, written consent is required; separate
from ToS; withdrawable at any time.\
• Scope: limited to identity verification, criminal records where
lawful, and sex offender registries; no credit checks for creators.\
• Use: report is used solely to grant or deny Trusted Pro; not for
unrelated decisions; no sharing with other users.\
• Adverse action: if considering a negative decision, send pre‑adverse
notice with report copy and rights; wait required period before final
decision.\
• Disputes: if user disputes accuracy, pause action until vendor
resolves; document outcomes; re‑evaluate decision.\
• Data retention: store minimal artifacts; delete per vendor and legal
schedules; restrict admin access with training.

Procedures & Operational Playbooks:\
• Flow: consent capture → vendor run → results to restricted queue →
decision template (approve/consider/insufficient) → notice steps (if
consider) → final outcome → badge or denial.\
• Training: FCRA basics for Trust admins; scripts for notices; time‑zone
aware waiting periods.\
• Vendor audits: quarterly SLAs, dispute timelines, and data security
attestations.

Enforcement & Remedies:\
• Outcomes: approve (badge issued), insufficient (ask for resubmission),
pre‑adverse + adverse (with required waits), appeal path if new
information supplied.\
• Misuse: any admin misuse is a severe policy breach; logs reviewed;
employment actions may result.

Data, Privacy & Retention:\
• PII vault for reports; masked views by default; access logs reviewed;
retention periods enforced; legal hold overrides documented.\
• End‑user privacy: no sharing of report content with other users; we
surface only badge/no‑badge and generic safety copy.

Templates & Required Notices (internal/external):\
• Templates: consent form; pre‑adverse notice; adverse action notice;
dispute intake; approval email; badge explainer.\
• Admin checklists: steps for each outcome; timers for waiting periods;
escalation paths.

Compliance Metrics & Audits:\
• Completion time; adverse action accuracy; dispute resolution time;
badge adoption; appeal success rates; access‑log anomalies.

Risks & Mitigations:\
• Jurisdictional variation → vendor handles localization; we allow city
gates if requirements differ.\
• Over‑reliance on checks → emphasize that reviews and reputation remain
primary; do not imply \'guarantee\' of safety.

Acceptance Checklist (ready to externalize):\
□ Consent screens tested; vendor contract signed; admin training
completed; notice templates reviewed by counsel; badge logic validated
in search and fees.

§8.4 --- Contracts & IP (SOW, Model Releases, Licensing Tiers)

§8.4 --- Contracts & IP (SOW, Model Releases, Licensing Tiers)

Disclaimer: This document is a policy and process blueprint intended for
product and operations planning. It does not constitute legal, tax, or
compliance advice. Consult qualified counsel before publishing external
policies or taking actions that create legal obligations. All examples
are illustrative and may need adaptation for jurisdiction‑specific law.

Context & Alignment: We are launching a US‑only creative marketplace
focused on models, photographers, videographers, and content creators.\
We have chosen a subscription‑free go‑to‑market with monetization via
take‑rate and optional, usage‑based promotions that are
eligibility‑gated and capped.\
Public content is artistic‑nudity‑only; Safe‑Mode defaults for guests
apply. Deliverables are transferred via external storage (Drive/Dropbox)
with immutable manifests.\
Payments flow through card (3DS where required) and ACH (with a
buyer‑fee discount); funds are escrowed and released on acceptance.\
Instant Book is gated by ID verification; background checks are opt‑in
(Trusted Pro). Feature flags and city gates are used for reversible,
auditable launches.\
Admin consoles enable Support, Trust & Safety, Finance, and Ops to
perform routine tasks without code changes.

Goals:\
• Provide standard templates and a Smart Docs system that aligns
expectations and IP rights before the shoot.\
• Prevent downstream disputes over usage by capturing license scope and
compensation clearly.\
• Respect creators' copyrights while enabling buyers to license what
they need.

Scope & Applicability:\
Applies to all paid bookings where deliverables or usage rights are
exchanged via the platform. TFP/collaboration bookings may use
lightweight agreements but still require model releases where faces are
identifiable.

Definitions (plain language):\
• Statement of Work (SOW): scope, deliverables, timeline, compensation,
change‑order process.\
• Model Release: consent by a person depicted to use their likeness
under specified terms.\
• License: the permission granted by the rights holder to use content in
defined ways; may be exclusive or nonexclusive.\
• Assignment: transfer of ownership of the IP; rare and requires
explicit agreement and additional compensation.

Policy Statements:\
• Default posture: the creator (photographer/videographer) owns the
copyright; buyers obtain a license selected at checkout.\
• License tiers: social/web; advertising; commercial print; broadcast;
each with territory/duration options and price add‑ons.\
• Model releases: required for identifiable persons; stored with
booking; expiration and revocation terms spelled out.\
• Change orders: add‑on licenses post‑shoot are supported; receipts
amended; SOW updated in Smart Docs.\
• Moral rights: where applicable, we avoid derogatory treatment clauses;
we permit credit removal if safety requires.\
• No hidden assignments: platform license is limited to hosting,
processing, and displaying content for the service.

Procedures & Operational Playbooks:\
• Pre‑shoot: SOW and release e‑sign; deliverables and license selected;
both parties see plain‑English summaries.\
• Post‑shoot: deliverables manifest posted; acceptance triggers license
effectiveness; upgrades handled via change order.\
• Disputes: receipts, SOW, and releases become the definitive record;
support follows playbook to assess scope.

Enforcement & Remedies:\
• Breach: failure to deliver or misuse of content triggers remedies
(refunds, takedown, license suspension).\
• Infringement: DMCA process for third‑party claims; internal
investigation where platform features are misused.\
• Bad‑faith buyers/providers: sanctions include loss of Trusted Pro,
promotions eligibility, or account limits.

Data, Privacy & Retention:\
• Data retention: SOW/releases stored 7 years; hashes captured for
integrity; minimal PII in public artifacts.\
• Privacy: releases and SOW not publicly displayed; only status and
scope summaries shown to the counterparty.

Templates & Required Notices (internal/external):\
• Templates: SOW per role; model release variants; license matrix;
change‑order terms; takedown request forms.\
• Help‑center: \'Which license do I need?\' wizard; examples of common
scenarios.

Compliance Metrics & Audits:\
• Dispute rate related to license scope; frequency of change‑order
upgrades; time‑to‑sign for SOW/releases; takedown SLAs.

Risks & Mitigations:\
• Ambiguous license language → publish examples; require plain‑English
summaries; prohibit hidden assignments.\
• Edge cases (e.g., collage, AI stylization) → add addenda and clarify
derivative works rights.

Acceptance Checklist (ready to externalize):\
□ Templates reviewed by counsel; Smart Docs integrated; license matrix
priced; support trained on SOW/release evidence handling.

§8.5 --- Payments, Refunds & Chargebacks (Consumer Law Notes)

§8.5 --- Payments, Refunds & Chargebacks (Consumer Law Notes)

Disclaimer: This document is a policy and process blueprint intended for
product and operations planning. It does not constitute legal, tax, or
compliance advice. Consult qualified counsel before publishing external
policies or taking actions that create legal obligations. All examples
are illustrative and may need adaptation for jurisdiction‑specific law.

Context & Alignment: We are launching a US‑only creative marketplace
focused on models, photographers, videographers, and content creators.\
We have chosen a subscription‑free go‑to‑market with monetization via
take‑rate and optional, usage‑based promotions that are
eligibility‑gated and capped.\
Public content is artistic‑nudity‑only; Safe‑Mode defaults for guests
apply. Deliverables are transferred via external storage (Drive/Dropbox)
with immutable manifests.\
Payments flow through card (3DS where required) and ACH (with a
buyer‑fee discount); funds are escrowed and released on acceptance.\
Instant Book is gated by ID verification; background checks are opt‑in
(Trusted Pro). Feature flags and city gates are used for reversible,
auditable launches.\
Admin consoles enable Support, Trust & Safety, Finance, and Ops to
perform routine tasks without code changes.

Goals:\
• Explain money flows plainly and enforce refund/cancellation windows
consistently.\
• Maximize successful representment in disputes by keeping clean records
(escrow, manifests, timestamps).\
• Avoid unfair practices; provide accessible help‑center content that
sets expectations.

Scope & Applicability:\
Applies to all escrowed transactions, ACH and card payments, deposits,
cancellations, and post‑booking adjustments within the US.

Definitions (plain language):\
• Escrow: funds held until acceptance; release triggers defined in §1.3
and §4.12.\
• Change Order: a mutually agreed price/time adjustment posted to the
thread; amends receipts and escrow.\
• Chargeback: cardholder disputes a charge with issuer; we respond with
evidence.\
• ACH Return: bank rejects a debit; we handle via returns codes, fees,
and communication.

Policy Statements:\
• Clear disclosures: fees, taxes, deposits, and refund windows displayed
before purchase and in receipts.\
• Refund bands: time‑based buyer refunds; provider‑fault refunds include
buyer fee; late cancels tracked for reputation.\
• Chargeback playbook: gather SOW, releases, chats, acceptance,
manifest; construct a concise narrative; file within deadline.\
• ACH handling: post returns code; adjust buyer fee if method changes;
reattempt under policy.\
• No cash: off‑platform payments are prohibited within the UI; repeated
attempts can throttle messaging.\
• Tips: zero platform fee; optional and processed post‑completion.

Procedures & Operational Playbooks:\
• Support macros: standard refunds; reschedule; partial refunds;
provider‑fault; chargeback kits.\
• Admin tools: re‑issue receipts; partial refund apportionment; deposit
auth/capture logs for studios.\
• Finance close: daily reconciliation; settlement variance alarms; tax
export by jurisdiction.

Enforcement & Remedies:\
• Outcomes: refund issued, denied (with rationale), partial; chargeback
won/lost; ACH return resolved.\
• Abuse controls: refund/chargeback abuse flags; repeat offenders lose
Instant Book or are limited.

Data, Privacy & Retention:\
• Sensitive data: card/ACH tokens only; we never store PANs; PII vaulted
and masked; least‑privilege on admin pages.\
• Retention: receipts kept per finance policy; chargeback evidence
retained for at least 18 months.

Templates & Required Notices (internal/external):\
• Templates: refund confirmations; chargeback narratives; ACH return
explanations; late‑cancel warnings.\
• Help‑center: \'How refunds work,\' \'What happens in a dispute,\'
\'Deposits for studios,\' \'Tips & payouts\'.

Compliance Metrics & Audits:\
• Refund SLA; representment win rate; settlement variance; ACH return
rate; average time to resolution; user satisfaction scores for money
tickets.

Risks & Mitigations:\
• Ambiguous refund copy → standardize; preview math in price box; reduce
surprises.\
• Evidence gaps → require manifest and acceptance; reduce \'not as
described\' disputes with SOW clarity.

Acceptance Checklist (ready to externalize):\
□ Macros published; finance reports green 14/14 days; chargeback kit
quality audits ≥ 95%; dispute loss rate trending down.

§8.6 --- Sales‑Tax & Marketplace Facilitator Stance (State Matrix; Tax
Engine)

§8.6 --- Sales‑Tax & Marketplace Facilitator Stance (State Matrix; Tax
Engine)

Disclaimer: This document is a policy and process blueprint intended for
product and operations planning. It does not constitute legal, tax, or
compliance advice. Consult qualified counsel before publishing external
policies or taking actions that create legal obligations. All examples
are illustrative and may need adaptation for jurisdiction‑specific law.

Context & Alignment: We are launching a US‑only creative marketplace
focused on models, photographers, videographers, and content creators.\
We have chosen a subscription‑free go‑to‑market with monetization via
take‑rate and optional, usage‑based promotions that are
eligibility‑gated and capped.\
Public content is artistic‑nudity‑only; Safe‑Mode defaults for guests
apply. Deliverables are transferred via external storage (Drive/Dropbox)
with immutable manifests.\
Payments flow through card (3DS where required) and ACH (with a
buyer‑fee discount); funds are escrowed and released on acceptance.\
Instant Book is gated by ID verification; background checks are opt‑in
(Trusted Pro). Feature flags and city gates are used for reversible,
auditable launches.\
Admin consoles enable Support, Trust & Safety, Finance, and Ops to
perform routine tasks without code changes.

Goals:\
• Rely on a tax engine for jurisdiction determination and rate
calculation; avoid hard‑coding volatile rules.\
• Document when we act as collector vs when the provider does, based on
service type and state posture.\
• Ensure receipts and exports itemize tax correctly; support amendments
and refunds.

Scope & Applicability:\
Applies to taxable services and fees in the United States where state or
local law imposes sales or similar transaction taxes. At launch we rely
on a tax engine configured for US‑only; coverage expands city‑by‑city
per §6.3.

Definitions (plain language):\
• Marketplace facilitator: a platform obligated in some jurisdictions to
collect/ remit tax on third‑party sales.\
• Taxable base: the portion of the transaction subject to tax (service,
fees, deposits if captured).\
• Sourcing: origin‑based vs destination‑based rules for services;
determined by the engine using addresses.

Policy Statements:\
• Engine‑first policy: we use tax provider quotes at checkout and store
a tax transaction id; we do not invent rates.\
• Role mapping: talent services vs studio rentals may be taxed
differently; we configure item categories accordingly.\
• Receipts: show tax lines by leg; deposit auth not taxed; captured
deposits taxed if jurisdiction requires.\
• Refunds & amendments: credit memos issued through the engine; partial
refunds adjust tax proportionally.\
• Allowlist rollout: only enable tax in states we have configured and
tested; show banner where tax is not yet collected.

Procedures & Operational Playbooks:\
• Admin tax map: city/state allowlist; category mapping; override flags
when the engine is down.\
• Nightly reconciliation: totals by jurisdiction; exception report for
missing tax ids; SLA checks for latency.

Enforcement & Remedies:\
• Outcomes: tax collected & remitted via engine; tax not applicable; or
pending due to outage (with user banner).\
• Mis‑classification: fix mapping; issue adjustments; document in
reconciliation logs.

Data, Privacy & Retention:\
• PII minimization: addresses and TINs stored in vault; tax data limited
to what is required; logs scrubbed.\
• Retention: export archives per finance schedule; legal holds paused
when necessary.

Templates & Required Notices (internal/external):\
• Templates: tax‑enabled banner copy; \'tax not collected yet in your
state\' banner; reconciliation playbook; outage copy.\
• Help‑center: \'How taxes work,\' \'Why was tax charged?,\' \'Which
services are taxed?\'

Compliance Metrics & Audits:\
• Tax latency; quote success rate; reconciliation variance; number of
overrides; user contacts about tax confusion.

Risks & Mitigations:\
• Volatile rules → centralize in engine; avoid bespoke logic in app;
maintain a small allowlist for coverage.\
• User confusion → show simple copy and itemized receipts; link to help
center; keep support macros ready.

Acceptance Checklist (ready to externalize):\
□ Engine configured; allowlist published; receipts itemize correctly;
nightly reconciliation and exports passing for 30 days.

§8.7 --- Data Protection & PII (Public‑Facing Summary of §5.7)

§8.7 --- Data Protection & PII (Public‑Facing Summary of §5.7)

Disclaimer: This document is a policy and process blueprint intended for
product and operations planning. It does not constitute legal, tax, or
compliance advice. Consult qualified counsel before publishing external
policies or taking actions that create legal obligations. All examples
are illustrative and may need adaptation for jurisdiction‑specific law.

Context & Alignment: We are launching a US‑only creative marketplace
focused on models, photographers, videographers, and content creators.\
We have chosen a subscription‑free go‑to‑market with monetization via
take‑rate and optional, usage‑based promotions that are
eligibility‑gated and capped.\
Public content is artistic‑nudity‑only; Safe‑Mode defaults for guests
apply. Deliverables are transferred via external storage (Drive/Dropbox)
with immutable manifests.\
Payments flow through card (3DS where required) and ACH (with a
buyer‑fee discount); funds are escrowed and released on acceptance.\
Instant Book is gated by ID verification; background checks are opt‑in
(Trusted Pro). Feature flags and city gates are used for reversible,
auditable launches.\
Admin consoles enable Support, Trust & Safety, Finance, and Ops to
perform routine tasks without code changes.

Goals:\
• Explain plainly what data we collect, why, and how we protect it.\
• Honor least‑privilege access, masking, and audit trails for PII.\
• Offer user controls (exports, deletion where applicable) and clear
contact channels.

Scope & Applicability:\
Applies to all personal data processed in connection with accounts,
bookings, messaging, payments, and safety operations within the United
States.

Definitions (plain language):\
• PII: information that identifies a person (e.g., name, email, phone)
and sensitive identifiers (DOB, TIN).\
• Vault: secure store for sensitive fields; access restricted and
audited.\
• Data Subject Request (DSR): a user request for access, correction, or
deletion of their data where applicable.

Policy Statements:\
• Data minimization: collect only what we need to operate and secure the
service (identity, payments, safety).\
• Purpose limitation: do not repurpose data for unrelated advertising;
usage limited to service operations and safety.\
• Security: encryption in transit and at rest; tokenized payments;
masked PII in admin; JIT elevation for sensitive unmasking.\
• User controls: profile edits; download receipts; data export on
request; account closure flow with data retention explanation.\
• Third parties: share data only with processors and vendors necessary
to deliver the service; contracts require security and privacy
safeguards.\
• Children: 18+ only; remove accounts if discovered to be underage;
report where required.

Procedures & Operational Playbooks:\
• DSR flow: intake → verify identity → scope data → fulfill → log;
denial templates for narrow exceptions.\
• Breach response: incident roles; containment; notification thresholds;
post‑mortem with remediation tasks.\
• Access reviews: quarterly RBAC review; remove stale admin accounts;
rotate secrets on schedule.

Enforcement & Remedies:\
• Enforcement: violations of access policy trigger investigation;
repeated misuse leads to employment action; all actions audited.\
• Appeals: users can escalate DSR outcomes via support; internal privacy
officer reviews edge cases.

Data, Privacy & Retention:\
• Retention schedule: finance records, releases, and SOW timelines;
purge jobs for expired artifacts; legal hold overrides documented.\
• Transparency: publish privacy summary with last‑updated date; log of
material changes.

Templates & Required Notices (internal/external):\
• Templates: DSR intake; identity verification steps; breach notice
skeleton; privacy summary page; vendor due‑diligence checklist.\
• Training decks: PII handling and phishing drills; admin console
privacy controls primer.

Compliance Metrics & Audits:\
• DSR SLA; time to revoke stale admin access; secrets rotation
adherence; privacy incident count; audit of PII access logs.

Risks & Mitigations:\
• Over‑collection → reduce fields and retention; Vault misuse → increase
audits and training; vendor risk → conduct due diligence and monitoring.

Acceptance Checklist (ready to externalize):\
□ Privacy summary published; DSR tooling live; access review calendar
set; breach runbook tested; vendor checklist adopted.

§8.8 --- Subpoena & Law‑Enforcement Process (With §4.14.15 Hooks)

§8.8 --- Subpoena & Law‑Enforcement Process (With §4.14.15 Hooks)

Disclaimer: This document is a policy and process blueprint intended for
product and operations planning. It does not constitute legal, tax, or
compliance advice. Consult qualified counsel before publishing external
policies or taking actions that create legal obligations. All examples
are illustrative and may need adaptation for jurisdiction‑specific law.

Context & Alignment: We are launching a US‑only creative marketplace
focused on models, photographers, videographers, and content creators.\
We have chosen a subscription‑free go‑to‑market with monetization via
take‑rate and optional, usage‑based promotions that are
eligibility‑gated and capped.\
Public content is artistic‑nudity‑only; Safe‑Mode defaults for guests
apply. Deliverables are transferred via external storage (Drive/Dropbox)
with immutable manifests.\
Payments flow through card (3DS where required) and ACH (with a
buyer‑fee discount); funds are escrowed and released on acceptance.\
Instant Book is gated by ID verification; background checks are opt‑in
(Trusted Pro). Feature flags and city gates are used for reversible,
auditable launches.\
Admin consoles enable Support, Trust & Safety, Finance, and Ops to
perform routine tasks without code changes.

Goals:\
• Respond lawfully and narrowly to valid legal process while protecting
user privacy and safety.\
• Provide an emergency disclosure path for imminent harm consistent with
law.\
• Maintain impeccable audit trails and chain‑of‑custody for any data
disclosed.

Scope & Applicability:\
Applies to all requests from government entities, private litigants, and
law enforcement seeking user data.

Definitions (plain language):\
• Legal Process: a subpoena, court order, or warrant that compels
disclosure of certain records.\
• Emergency Disclosure: a request asserting imminent harm to a person;
processed under a defined policy.\
• Notice: where permitted by law, informing users that their data has
been requested.

Policy Statements:\
• Intake: verify authority, scope, and jurisdiction; reject over‑broad
or improper requests; require correct service.\
• Notice: unless legally barred, inform the user with a copy of the
request and time to object.\
• Narrow tailoring: produce only what is specified; prefer metadata over
content where lawful.\
• Chain of custody: hash and inventory produced files; store in
restricted evidence repository.\
• Emergency requests: accept via official channels; require written
confirmation; log and review post‑hoc.

Procedures & Operational Playbooks:\
• Admin integration: §4.14.15 legal holds; evidence tagging; restricted
access groups.\
• Escalation: counsel reviews; senior approval for content disclosures;
regular audits of requests.

Enforcement & Remedies:\
• Enforcement: deny improper requests; seek to quash where appropriate;
document refusals and reasons.\
• Abuse reporting: if a request appears abusive, escalate; do not comply
until clarified.

Data, Privacy & Retention:\
• PII minimization in productions; redact third‑party PII where not
requested; secure transfer methods; retention per legal hold schedule.

Templates & Required Notices (internal/external):\
• Templates: subpoena intake form; user notice; emergency disclosure
form; production cover letter; denial letter.\
• Logs: request register with dates, types, outcomes; annual
transparency report summary.

Compliance Metrics & Audits:\
• Request volume; mean time to legal review; % of requests narrowed;
transparency report cadence.

Risks & Mitigations:\
• Improper service → train intake; scope creep → insist on narrow
requests; confidentiality orders → track notice restrictions and expiry.

Acceptance Checklist (ready to externalize):\
□ Counsel on retainer; intake mailbox monitored; evidence repository
configured; transparency report template ready.

§8.9 --- Accessibility & Anti‑Discrimination Commitments

§8.9 --- Accessibility & Anti‑Discrimination Commitments

Disclaimer: This document is a policy and process blueprint intended for
product and operations planning. It does not constitute legal, tax, or
compliance advice. Consult qualified counsel before publishing external
policies or taking actions that create legal obligations. All examples
are illustrative and may need adaptation for jurisdiction‑specific law.

Context & Alignment: We are launching a US‑only creative marketplace
focused on models, photographers, videographers, and content creators.\
We have chosen a subscription‑free go‑to‑market with monetization via
take‑rate and optional, usage‑based promotions that are
eligibility‑gated and capped.\
Public content is artistic‑nudity‑only; Safe‑Mode defaults for guests
apply. Deliverables are transferred via external storage (Drive/Dropbox)
with immutable manifests.\
Payments flow through card (3DS where required) and ACH (with a
buyer‑fee discount); funds are escrowed and released on acceptance.\
Instant Book is gated by ID verification; background checks are opt‑in
(Trusted Pro). Feature flags and city gates are used for reversible,
auditable launches.\
Admin consoles enable Support, Trust & Safety, Finance, and Ops to
perform routine tasks without code changes.

Goals:\
• Deliver equitable access to the platform and prohibit discrimination
by users in listings and bookings.\
• Commit to WCAG 2.1 AA and continuous accessibility improvement.\
• Protect users from harassment and discriminatory conduct in content
and messages.

Scope & Applicability:\
Applies to all product surfaces, content, and user interactions.
Providers and buyers must comply with non‑discrimination rules in their
offers and conduct.

Definitions (plain language):\
• Accessibility: making content usable by people with disabilities,
including visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive.\
• Discrimination: unfavorable treatment based on protected classes
(e.g., race, gender, disability, religion, sexual orientation).\
• Accommodation: reasonable modifications to policies and practices
where appropriate.

Policy Statements:\
• WCAG commitment: design system patterns aim for 2.1 AA; audits
scheduled; defects tracked like product bugs.\
• Non‑discrimination: providers may define genre/skill/availability
criteria but may not refuse work based on protected classes.\
• Harassment policy: aligned with §8.2; zero tolerance for slurs,
targeting, or exclusionary conduct.\
• Accommodation: support channels for accessibility needs; studio house
rules must include accessible entry info where applicable.

Procedures & Operational Playbooks:\
• Accessibility QA: keyboard nav tests, contrast checks, screen reader
flows; bug triage and regression tests.\
• Enforcement: report intake for discrimination; evidence review;
proportionate actions; education first where misunderstanding is likely.

Enforcement & Remedies:\
• Outcomes: warning, content removal, booking cancellation support, or
account limits; repeat violations escalate.\
• Appeals: allow users to contest decisions; moderators consider context
and cultural sensitivity.

Data, Privacy & Retention:\
• Data: avoid collecting protected class data unless required for law;
do not use protected attributes in ranking or promotions.\
• Privacy: accommodation requests handled discreetly; limited
visibility; retention minimal.

Templates & Required Notices (internal/external):\
• Templates: accessibility statement; discrimination policy; report
forms; accommodation request flows; guidance for studio accessibility
disclosure.\
• Training: inclusive language for support; accessible design patterns
for product and marketing.

Compliance Metrics & Audits:\
• Accessibility defect rate; time to fix high‑severity accessibility
bugs; discrimination report outcomes; user satisfaction among
screen‑reader users.

Risks & Mitigations:\
• Token compliance without usability → test with real users; uneven
enforcement → publish examples and decisions to reduce ambiguity.

§8.10 --- Compliance Calendar (Filings, Policy Reviews, Audits)

§8.10 --- Compliance Calendar (Filings, Policy Reviews, Audits)

Disclaimer: This document is a policy and process blueprint intended for
product and operations planning. It does not constitute legal, tax, or
compliance advice. Consult qualified counsel before publishing external
policies or taking actions that create legal obligations. All examples
are illustrative and may need adaptation for jurisdiction‑specific law.

Context & Alignment: We are launching a US‑only creative marketplace
focused on models, photographers, videographers, and content creators.\
We have chosen a subscription‑free go‑to‑market with monetization via
take‑rate and optional, usage‑based promotions that are
eligibility‑gated and capped.\
Public content is artistic‑nudity‑only; Safe‑Mode defaults for guests
apply. Deliverables are transferred via external storage (Drive/Dropbox)
with immutable manifests.\
Payments flow through card (3DS where required) and ACH (with a
buyer‑fee discount); funds are escrowed and released on acceptance.\
Instant Book is gated by ID verification; background checks are opt‑in
(Trusted Pro). Feature flags and city gates are used for reversible,
auditable launches.\
Admin consoles enable Support, Trust & Safety, Finance, and Ops to
perform routine tasks without code changes.

Goals:\
• Create a predictable cadence for legal and compliance tasks so nothing
is reactive.\
• Bundle policy reviews with product milestones; keep public pages fresh
and versioned.\
• Audit vendors and internal controls on a regular schedule.

Scope & Applicability:\
Applies to Trust & Safety, Finance, Legal, and Data teams; coordinated
by an owner who maintains the shared calendar.

Definitions (plain language):\
• Quarterly: policy reviews, RBAC access review, vendor SLAs and
security attestations, data retention jobs audit.\
• Monthly: finance close QA, tax reconciliation, promotions
invalid‑click review, privacy access ledger report.\
• Annual: SOC evidence pack progress, pentest, DMCA agent check,
ADA/accessibility review, disaster recovery drill.

Policy Statements:\
• Owners: named DRI for each recurring task; backups assigned;
escalations defined.\
• Artifacts: checklists stored in admin; timestamps captured; outcomes
posted to an internal \'compliance log\'.\
• City‑by‑city: calendar reflects city launches; tasks added as tax,
promotions, and studios enable in new cities.

Procedures & Operational Playbooks:\
• Enforcement: missed tasks trigger escalation; repeat misses lead to
process changes; calendar visible to execs.\
• Risk‑based prioritization: high‑risk tasks take precedence during
incident weeks; low‑risk items may defer with approval.

Enforcement & Remedies:\
• Data hygiene: purge jobs verified; evidence repositories trimmed;
legal holds reviewed and released when resolved.\
• Privacy: DSR volume monitored; training refreshers scheduled; secrets
rotation logged.

Data, Privacy & Retention:\
• Templates: quarterly review checklist; RBAC access review form; vendor
questionnaire; DR drill script; SOC evidence index.\
• Dashboards: compliance status board; upcoming deadlines; error budgets
for misses.

Templates & Required Notices (internal/external):\
• Task completion rate; on‑time rate; audit findings; vendor remediation
rates; incident reduction post‑reviews.

Compliance Metrics & Audits:\
• Calendar sprawl → consolidate and assign DRIs; drift between policy
and product → tie reviews to release trains.\
• Vendor fatigue → rotate deep‑dives; keep a minimal baseline
questionnaire for low‑risk vendors.

Risks & Mitigations:\
• Calendar published; owners and backups named; first cycle completed
with notes; dashboard showing green/yellow/red for each area.

Acceptance Checklist (ready to externalize):\
□ Counsel review completed; public pages staged with versioning.\
□ Admin tools wired (queues, redaction, approvals) with audit trails.\
□ Training delivered to Support/T&S/Finance; templates published.\
□ Feature flags and city allowlists configured; rollback tested.\
□ Telemetry and dashboards live; acceptance tests passed.

Each sub‑section is a detailed write‑up (≥2,500 words) with formulas and
acceptance checklists aligned to Sections 1--8.

§9.0 --- Modeling Assumptions (Traffic, Conversion, City Ramp)

§9.0 --- Modeling Assumptions (Traffic, Conversion, City Ramp)

Financial Modeling Disclaimer: This section provides planning
assumptions, formulas, and structures for internal modeling. It is not a
forecast or financial advice. All sample numbers are illustrative;
replace with real inputs once telemetry in §5 is live.

Context & Alignment: We operate a US‑only creative marketplace
connecting models, photographers, videographers, and content creators
with buyers and studios. Launch strategy is subscription‑free;
monetization is via take‑rate on bookings and usage‑based promotions
(capped, labeled, eligibility‑gated). Public content is artistic‑only;
deliverables use external storage with immutable manifests. Instant Book
requires ID verification; background checks are opt‑in (Trusted Pro).
ACH reduces buyer fee to 3% where enabled. Feature flags and city gates
control rollout; admin tools and audits turn policy into software.

Goals:\
• Establish realistic, testable assumptions for traffic, conversion, and
growth that tie to product flags and city gates.\
• Align finance with measurement: every assumption maps to an event or
metric in §5.\
• Create a baseline and two alt scenarios (conservative/aggressive)
without overfitting early noise.

Key variables & baselines:\
• Cities & cohorts: Houston (Cohort‑1) GA at T+90; City‑2 pilot at
T+180; City‑3 at T+240 under §6.4 readiness.\
• Supply (providers): Active providers = listed + ID‑verified with ≥1
package; Trusted Pro as a subset.\
• Demand (buyers): Active buyers = ≥1 inquiry or booking in trailing 28
days.\
• Conversion: Search→Inquiry (S→I) and Inquiry→Booking (I→B) defined in
§6; rep score & Instant Book shift these.\
• GMV: Gross value of bookings excluding buyer fee and tax; sum of
subtotals per leg.\
• AOV: Average order value per leg; varies by role and city tier.\
• Cancellations: Time‑banded rates; late cancels affect reputation and
rebooking behavior.\
• Chargebacks: Rate on card transactions; ACH has different failure
profile (returns).\
• Payment mix: Card vs ACH share; ACH reduces buyer fee but lowers
processing cost.\
• Promotions adoption: Share of eligible providers purchasing
CPC/Featured; ROAS targets from §3.3.\
• Tax coverage: Allowlist states per §4.12/§6.3; banner when off.\
• Seasonality: Minor seasonality; spikes near holidays and local event
seasons.

Core formulas (structure; plug real telemetry later):\
• ActiveProviders_t = NewProviders_t + Reactivated_t − Churn_t\
• ActiveBuyers_t = NewBuyers_t + Reactivated_t − Churn_t\
• Inquiries_t = Searches_t × (S→I) × EligibilityRate_t\
• Bookings_t = Inquiries_t × (I→B) × (1 − CancelRate_t)\
• GMV_t = Σ (BookingSubtotal_i) for all completed legs in period t\
• AOV_role,city = GMV_role,city / Bookings_role,city\
• TakeRate_net ≈ (ProviderFee% × GMV) + BuyerFee% × GMV_equiv +
PromotionsRevenue − ProcessorCOGS − VariableOpsCOGS

Cohort maturation curves:\
Supply tends to mature faster than demand in creator marketplaces. We
model a s‑curve for provider activation (profile→IDV→first package→first
booking) and a slightly slower curve for buyer repeat rate. These curves
are parameterized so we can fit them once we have 8--12 weeks of
telemetry.

Eligibility & gating:\
Availability, distance, price fit, and NSFW toggle are filters that
reduce the eligible supply set a buyer sees. Promotions never expand
eligibility; they only surface within matching results.

Data discipline:\
Every assumption above maps to a field or table in the §5 warehouse
(fact_search, fact_inquiry, fact_booking_leg, fact_payment, fact_promo).
Finance does not hard‑code rates; we consume aggregates from Gold tables
with freshness SLOs.

Instrumentation & success metrics:\
• Search→Inquiry and Inquiry→Booking (city×role) with 7/14/28d trends\
• Active providers and buyers (28d) with growth and churn by cohort\
• GMV, AOV, and leg count by city×role\
• Cancellation and chargeback rates by payment type\
• ACH share of checkouts; promotions adoption and ROAS by role×city

Top risks & mitigations:\
• Early noise overfitting → use ranges and guardrails; wait for stable
cohorts before revising baselines.\
• Mis‑measured eligibility → implement precise denominator definitions
and audits in §5.8.\
• Seasonality misreads → annotate events (festivals, holidays) in a
calendar dimension.

Acceptance checklist:\
□ Assumptions document reviewed monthly; deltas tied to observed
telemetry.\
□ Cohort curves parameterized and ready to fit after 8--12 weeks of
data.\
□ Gold tables for search, inquiry, booking, and payment pass DQ gates.

Modeling Deep‑Dive:\
• Scenario setup: Define a city cohort with starting supply and demand,
apply search→inquiry and inquiry→booking rates from §6.2/§6.3, then
layer on cancellations, lateness, and chargebacks. Compute GMV per
cohort and pass it through fee structure, taxes, and processor costs.\
• Unit economics: For a representative \$X booking, compute provider fee
(12%), buyer fee (5% or 3% with ACH), and processing cost. Show platform
net before variable ops (content safety scans, IDV/BG subsidies). Repeat
for small (≤\$150), mid (\$300--\$600), and large (\>\$1,000) bookings.\
• Promotions ROI: Using holdouts, estimate incremental GMV from paid
exposure. Attribute revenue to promotions net of invalid‑click credits.
Ensure quality score and eligibility keep paid from cannibalizing
organic relevance.\
• Sensitivity toggles: Vary ACH adoption (10--40%), chargebacks
(0.2--0.6%), cancellations (3--10%), and promotions adoption (5--25%) to
see contribution margin swings.\
• City expansion: Add a second city with a 3--6 month lag. Reuse
maturation curves and observe shared services leverage (support, SRE).

§9.1 --- Revenue Drivers (Take‑Rate, Promotions, Other)

§9.1 --- Revenue Drivers (Take‑Rate, Promotions, Other)

Financial Modeling Disclaimer: This section provides planning
assumptions, formulas, and structures for internal modeling. It is not a
forecast or financial advice. All sample numbers are illustrative;
replace with real inputs once telemetry in §5 is live.

Context & Alignment: We operate a US‑only creative marketplace
connecting models, photographers, videographers, and content creators
with buyers and studios. Launch strategy is subscription‑free;
monetization is via take‑rate on bookings and usage‑based promotions
(capped, labeled, eligibility‑gated). Public content is artistic‑only;
deliverables use external storage with immutable manifests. Instant Book
requires ID verification; background checks are opt‑in (Trusted Pro).
ACH reduces buyer fee to 3% where enabled. Feature flags and city gates
control rollout; admin tools and audits turn policy into software.

Goals:\
• Define all revenue streams with formulas that tie to product behavior
and receipts.\
• Make revenue recognition auditable via booking legs, receipts, and
promotions wallet.\
• Avoid vanity revenue---focus on durable drivers aligned with user
value.

Key variables & baselines:\
• Provider fee: 12% of booking subtotal; drops to 10% on portion \>
\$1,000; −1% Instant Book; −0.5% Trusted Pro (floor 9%).\
• Buyer fee: 5% (min \$3); 3% with ACH where enabled; refunded on
provider‑fault cancels.\
• Promotions: Search Boost (CPC) and Featured (weekly flat) usage‑based
with eligibility; clear caps and labels.\
• Tips: 0% platform fee; processed post‑completion (not revenue).\
• Other: None at launch (no subscriptions); potential future add‑ons
deferred to §13.

Core formulas (structure; plug real telemetry later):\
• Revenue_provider_fees_t = Σ (ProviderFeeRate_i × Subtotal_i) over
completed legs i\
• Revenue_buyer_fees_t = Σ (BuyerFeeRate_i × Subtotal_i) adjusted for
refunds and ACH discount\
• Revenue_promotions_t = CPC_clicks_t × CPC_price_t + Featured_slots_t ×
Weekly_price_t\
• NetRevenue_t = Revenue_provider_fees_t + Revenue_buyer_fees_t +
Revenue_promotions_t − ProcessorCOGS_t − Credits_invalid_clicks_t

Why buyer fee exists:\
Buyer fee offsets processor costs and support while keeping provider
take‑home attractive. The ACH discount aligns incentives by reducing
both processor cost and buyer fee, encouraging low‑cost rails.

Promotions alignment:\
Promotions generate revenue only when providers opt in, and only within
relevance caps. Holdouts quantify incremental GMV so providers spend
when it pays, not because ranking is rigged.

Recognition timing:\
Provider and buyer fees are recognized when the leg completes or is
accepted; promotions revenue is recognized as clicks/impressions
deliver; credits for invalid clicks reduce promotions revenue as
contra‑revenue.

Instrumentation & success metrics:\
• Take‑rate components: provider vs buyer vs promotions (stacked) by
city×role\
• Promotions adoption, CPC, CTR, ROAS distribution; invalid‑click credit
rate\
• ACH share and its effect on buyer fee and processor COGS\
• Refunded buyer fees due to provider‑fault cancels

Top risks & mitigations:\
• Perception of pay‑to‑win → capped slots, labels, eligibility gates;
transparency in \'Why am I seeing this?\'\
• Buyer fee backlash → clear value copy (escrow, contracts, support) and
ACH discount messaging\
• Revenue leakage via off‑platform payments → in‑chat warnings,
throttles, Trusted Pro incentives

Acceptance checklist:\
□ Revenue lines reconcile to receipts (per leg) and promotions wallet
events.\
□ Invalid‑click credits pipeline operational; audits sampled weekly.\
□ ACH effect on buyer fee and processing cost visible in dashboards.

§9.2 --- COGS (Processing, Trust/Safety, Tax, Deliverables, Comms)

§9.2 --- COGS (Processing, Trust/Safety, Tax, Deliverables, Comms)

Financial Modeling Disclaimer: This section provides planning
assumptions, formulas, and structures for internal modeling. It is not a
forecast or financial advice. All sample numbers are illustrative;
replace with real inputs once telemetry in §5 is live.

Context & Alignment: We operate a US‑only creative marketplace
connecting models, photographers, videographers, and content creators
with buyers and studios. Launch strategy is subscription‑free;
monetization is via take‑rate on bookings and usage‑based promotions
(capped, labeled, eligibility‑gated). Public content is artistic‑only;
deliverables use external storage with immutable manifests. Instant Book
requires ID verification; background checks are opt‑in (Trusted Pro).
ACH reduces buyer fee to 3% where enabled. Feature flags and city gates
control rollout; admin tools and audits turn policy into software.

Goals:\
• Identify all variable costs tied directly to transactions and
exposure.\
• Model processor fees for card vs ACH correctly; capture per‑event
costs (IDV, BG, tax, comms, safety).\
• Keep COGS low without compromising safety or compliance.

Key variables & baselines:\
• Card processing: Assume \~2.9% + \$0.30 per card charge (authorization
and capture as applicable); 3DS where required.\
• ACH processing: Assume \~0.5--0.8% effective with caps; returns
handling cost per event.\
• ID verification: Per‑check cost; subsidized for early cohorts; later
user‑paid or bundled in Trusted Pro pricing.\
• Background checks: Pass‑through or partially subsidized; include
adverse‑action processing overhead.\
• Tax engine: Per transaction quote + monthly minimum;
refunds/amendments charged per credit memo.\
• Content safety: Classifier scans per media; human moderation minutes
for escalations.\
• E‑signature: Per envelope for SOW/releases; negotiated tiers.\
• SMS/email: Per SMS/segment and email send; deliverability monitoring.\
• Chargeback fees: Per dispute fee; lost cases incur processor fees;
representment labor cost.\
• Invalid‑click credits: Reducing promotions revenue; monitoring and
auto‑credit pipeline cost.

Core formulas (structure; plug real telemetry later):\
• ProcessorCOGS_t = Σ (CardCharges_j × (rate% × amount_j + \$0.30)) + Σ
(ACHDebits_k × (ach_rate% × amount_k))\
• TrustSafetyCOGS_t = IDV_checks × IDV_unit_cost + BG_checks ×
BG_unit_cost + Moderation_minutes × cost_per_min\
• TaxCOGS_t = TaxQuotes × quote_cost + CreditMemos × memo_cost\
• CommsCOGS_t = SMS_segments × sms_cost + Emails × email_cost\
• ChargebackCOGS_t = Disputes × dispute_fee + Losses × lost_rev_effect

External deliverables keep hosting COGS low:\
By using external storage for heavy media, we avoid large variable
storage and egress costs. We still incur classifier and moderation costs
on thumbnails and metadata.

Unit cost levers:\
Negotiating ACH pricing, batching signatures into envelopes, and
training classifiers to reduce human moderation minutes are key levers
on COGS.

Attribution discipline:\
COGS must reconcile with usage events in §5; finance uses event counts ×
unit costs and cross‑checks with vendor invoices and Admin exports.

Instrumentation & success metrics:\
• COGS % of GMV and % of revenue; processor cost per \$ collected (card
vs ACH)\
• Moderation minutes per 1,000 media items; IDV/BG adoption vs subsidy
spend\
• Tax engine latency and success rate; credit memo accuracy; chargeback
win rate

Top risks & mitigations:\
• Processor fee creep → monitor effective rate; negotiate with volume;
shift mix to ACH where eligible\
• Under‑resourced moderation → safety risk; over‑moderation → creator
churn; balance with training and examples\
• Tax misconfiguration → reconciliation variance; keep allowlist tight
and audited

Acceptance checklist:\
□ COGS model wired to vendor usage; reconciliation report green for 30
days.\
□ ACH return macros and fee handling tested; chargeback kit process
audited.\
□ Content safety staffing plan in place for peak loads.

cohort and pass it through fee structure, taxes, and processor costs.\
• Unit economics: For a representative \$X booking, compute provider fee
(12%), buyer fee (5% or 3% with ACH), and processing cost. Show platform
net before variable ops (content safety scans, IDV/BG subsidies). Repeat
for small (≤\$150), mid (\$300--\$600), and large (\>\$1,000) bookings.\

§9.3 --- Opex & Headcount Plan (by Phase)

§9.3 --- Opex & Headcount Plan (by Phase)

Financial Modeling Disclaimer: This section provides planning
assumptions, formulas, and structures for internal modeling. It is not a
forecast or financial advice. All sample numbers are illustrative;
replace with real inputs once telemetry in §5 is live.

Context & Alignment: We operate a US‑only creative marketplace
connecting models, photographers, videographers, and content creators
with buyers and studios. Launch strategy is subscription‑free;
monetization is via take‑rate on bookings and usage‑based promotions
(capped, labeled, eligibility‑gated). Public content is artistic‑only;
deliverables use external storage with immutable manifests. Instant Book
requires ID verification; background checks are opt‑in (Trusted Pro).
ACH reduces buyer fee to 3% where enabled. Feature flags and city gates
control rollout; admin tools and audits turn policy into software.

Goals:\
• Plan operating expense and headcount that unlock milestones without
over‑hiring.\
• Tie hiring to GA gates and city expansion; prefer contractors for
commodity tasks early.\
• Keep data/infra spend disciplined (≤15% of GMV).

Key variables & baselines:\
• People: Engineering, Product, Design, Data, SRE, Support, Trust,
Finance, City Ops, Marketing.\
• Vendors: Comms, e‑signature, background/IDV, tax, analytics,
observability, ticketing.\
• Facilities: Remote‑first; optional coworking; travel for city ops and
studio partners.\
• Tooling: Source control, CI/CD, security scans, feature flags,
experimentation, admin console.

Core formulas (structure; plug real telemetry later):\
• Payroll_t = Σ (FTE_role × fully_loaded_cost_role) + Contractors_t\
• VendorOpex_t = Σ (SaaS_subscriptions) + Minimums (tax, comms) not in
COGS\
• TotalOpex_t = Payroll_t + VendorOpex_t + Facilities_t + Misc_t

Phase‑linked hiring:\
We add squads as §6 milestones unlock: Beta adds Growth/Promotions; GA
adds Money/Tax and Studios; post‑GA adds SRE. Support and T&S ramp with
ticket volume.

Contractor vs FTE:\
Use contractors for non‑differentiated tasks (e.g., help‑center
population, manual reviews) while retaining core differentiation
(search, booking, money, admin) in‑house.

Cost discipline:\
Finance reviews TB/day (data) and compute envelopes (§5.12). Feature
owners are accountable for admin operability to prevent support burden.

Instrumentation & success metrics:\
• Opex runway in months; burn multiple; payroll % of total opex; vendor
spend vs plan\
• Ticket volume per 1,000 legs; staffing vs SLA; error budget burn vs
engineer operating time

Top risks & mitigations:\
• Hiring ahead of demand → burn increases without revenue; mitigate with
gates\
• Under‑investing in SRE → reliability risk; mitigate with phased
on‑call and drills\
• Vendor sprawl → consolidate; maintain an approved vendor list and
renewal calendar

Acceptance checklist:\
□ Headcount plan per phase approved; offer templates ready; recruiting
funnel metrics live.\
□ Vendor roster with costs and owners published; renewal dates in
calendar.\
□ Runway and burn tracked monthly; alerts when thresholds breached.

§9.4 --- Marketing & CAC (City Seeding vs National)

§9.4 --- Marketing & CAC (City Seeding vs National)

Financial Modeling Disclaimer: This section provides planning
assumptions, formulas, and structures for internal modeling. It is not a
forecast or financial advice. All sample numbers are illustrative;
replace with real inputs once telemetry in §5 is live.

Context & Alignment: We operate a US‑only creative marketplace
connecting models, photographers, videographers, and content creators
with buyers and studios. Launch strategy is subscription‑free;
monetization is via take‑rate on bookings and usage‑based promotions
(capped, labeled, eligibility‑gated). Public content is artistic‑only;
deliverables use external storage with immutable manifests. Instant Book
requires ID verification; background checks are opt‑in (Trusted Pro).
ACH reduces buyer fee to 3% where enabled. Feature flags and city gates
control rollout; admin tools and audits turn policy into software.

Goals:\
• Establish a city‑first marketing plan with measurable CAC and payback
windows.\
• Use incentives (verification subsidies, Boost coupons) instead of
subscriptions to drive quality supply.\
• Balance organic loops (boards, posts, referrals) with targeted paid
tests.

Key variables & baselines:\
• Channels: Creator referrals, studio partners, social ads (limited
tests), content marketing, PR, email sequences, RFP broadcasts.\
• Incentives: IDV subsidies for early providers; Trusted Pro coupon;
buyer fee holidays for first booking in new city.\
• Budget framing: CAC caps relative to LTV; city‑level spend with clear
stop/go criteria.

Core formulas (structure; plug real telemetry later):\
• CAC_channel = Spend_channel /
NewActiveBuyers_or_Providers_from_channel\
• Payback_months = CAC / MonthlyContributionMargin_per_user\
• LTV_user = Σ (ContributionMargin_t × Retention_t) over horizon H

City‑first tactics:\
Leverage local studios, meetups, and micro‑influencers. Feature local
creators in home carousels. Offer limited buyer‑fee holidays
(time‑boxed) to spur first bookings.

Quality over volume:\
We avoid paying for low‑intent traffic. We favor channels that yield
ID‑verified providers and ready‑to‑book buyers.

Attribution:\
UTM discipline, post‑signup surveys, and blended CAC reporting prevent
false confidence in any one channel.

Instrumentation & success metrics:\
• CAC by channel; blended CAC; first‑booking rate; time to first
booking; repeat rate at 60/90 days\
• IDV adoption; Trusted Pro share; promotions usage among active
providers

Top risks & mitigations:\
• Vanity signups → require package publishing and first inquiry to count
as activation\
• Over‑spend on paid social → cap tests; demand ≥2× contribution payback
within 9--12 months\
• Referral fraud → limit per‑account rewards; require verified activity

Acceptance checklist:\
□ City marketing brief approved; budget caps and stop‑rules configured.\
□ Referral tracking live; coupon issuance and abuse guards in admin.\
□ Attribution dashboards validated with holdout cells where feasible.

§9.5 --- 24‑Month P&L Scenarios (Base / Conservative / Aggressive)

§9.5 --- 24‑Month P&L Scenarios (Base / Conservative / Aggressive)

Financial Modeling Disclaimer: This section provides planning
assumptions, formulas, and structures for internal modeling. It is not a
forecast or financial advice. All sample numbers are illustrative;
replace with real inputs once telemetry in §5 is live.

Context & Alignment: We operate a US‑only creative marketplace
connecting models, photographers, videographers, and content creators
with buyers and studios. Launch strategy is subscription‑free;
monetization is via take‑rate on bookings and usage‑based promotions
(capped, labeled, eligibility‑gated). Public content is artistic‑only;
deliverables use external storage with immutable manifests. Instant Book
requires ID verification; background checks are opt‑in (Trusted Pro).
ACH reduces buyer fee to 3% where enabled. Feature flags and city gates
control rollout; admin tools and audits turn policy into software.

Goals:\
• Provide a 24‑month P&L structure with three scenarios tied to city
launches and product milestones.\
• Make it easy to update with real telemetry and to communicate to
stakeholders.\
• Ensure cash planning reflects realistic opex and COGS envelopes.

Key variables & baselines:\
• Horizon: 24 months from launch; quarterly checkpoints for board
updates.\
• Scenarios: Conservative (slower adoption), Base (plan), Aggressive
(faster promos ROI and ACH uptake).\
• City timing: Houston GA by \~Month 6; City‑2 Month 9; City‑3 Month 12
(if §6.4 gates pass).

Core formulas (structure; plug real telemetry later):\
• Revenue_t = ProviderFees_t + BuyerFees_t + Promotions_t\
• COGS_t = Processor_t + TrustSafety_t + TaxEngine_t + Comms_t +
Chargeback_t\
• GrossMargin_t = Revenue_t − COGS_t\
• Opex_t = Payroll_t + VendorOpex_t + Facilities_t + Misc_t\
• EBITDA_t = GrossMargin_t − Opex_t\
• Cash_t = Cash\_{t−1} + EBITDA_t − Capex_t

Scenario deltas:\
The aggressive case assumes higher ACH adoption (→ lower processing cost
but slightly lower buyer fee), higher promotions adoption with
sustainable ROAS, and faster IDV/Trusted Pro uptake improving
conversion.

Communication:\
We present scenarios as ranges with narrative drivers rather than
single‑point forecasts. Board updates highlight which drivers moved and
why.

Updating cadence:\
Monthly actuals roll into the model; quarterly we re‑baseline scenario
envelopes to maintain credibility.

Instrumentation & success metrics:\
• GMV growth by city; take‑rate mix; promotions revenue share; processor
cost as % of collections\
• Gross margin %; opex ratio; EBITDA trajectory; runway months at
current burn

Top risks & mitigations:\
• Optimism bias → keep conservative case plausible and funded; treat
aggressive as upside-only\
• Uncontrolled opex → hiring frozen until milestones; vendor renewals
scrutinized\
• City launch slips → build schedule slack; emphasize quality signals
before spend

Acceptance checklist:\
□ Scenario workbook built with inputs linked to §5 Gold tables.\
□ Quarterly board pack template prepared with red/yellow/green on key
drivers.\
□ Runway calculator validated with cash reconciliation.

ACH reduces buyer fee to 3% where enabled. Feature flags and city gates
control rollout; admin tools and audits turn policy into software.

Goals:\
• Quantify how small changes in key inputs move contribution margin and
runway.\
• Prioritize levers that we can influence (ACH adoption, promotions
ROAS, cancellation policy).\
• Expose hidden convexities (e.g., chargebacks) early.

Key variables & baselines:\
• Levers: Provider fee floors; buyer fee ACH discount; promotions
adoption and CPC floors; studio attach; cancellation policy bands.\
• Friction terms: Chargeback rates; dispute win rate; tax engine
latency; moderation load; ACH returns.

Core formulas (structure; plug real telemetry later):\
• ΔContribution = ∂(Revenue − COGS)/∂x × Δx, evaluated at Base scenario\
• Elasticity_ROAS = ∂GMV_incremental/∂CPC / CPC\
• ACH_effect = (ΔBuyerFee − ΔProcessorCost) at Δ(ACH share)

ACH lever:\
Higher ACH share reduces processor cost and buyer fee revenue; net
effect often positive due to cost savings and buyer conversion lift.

Promotions lever:\
Promotions revenue matters only if ROAS≥2.5× and invalid‑click credits
are low; we control CPC floors and density caps city‑by‑city.

Cancellation policy:\
Tighter late‑cancel penalties reduce waste but may reduce demand;
measure rebooking offsets and reputation effects.

Instrumentation & success metrics:\
• Tornado chart of contribution drivers; ACH net effect; promotions
incremental GMV; cancellation impact on net revenue\
• Studio attach rate and deposit claim rates; effect on GMV and support
costs

Top risks & mitigations:\
• Over‑tuning to early data → require confidence intervals; avoid noisy
toggling\
• Hidden correlations → run multifactor analyses; keep experiments
orthogonal where possible

Acceptance checklist:\
□ Sensitivity dashboard live; drivers ranked by impact and
controllability.\
□ Levers with high impact assigned owners and experiments.\
□ Guardrails set for fee and CPC floor changes per city.

Modeling Deep‑Dive:\
• Scenario setup: Define a city cohort with starting supply and demand,
apply search→inquiry and inquiry→booking rates from §6.2/§6.3, then
layer on cancellations, lateness, and chargebacks. Compute GMV per
cohort and pass it through fee structure, taxes, and processor costs.\
• Unit economics: For a representative \$X booking, compute provider fee
(12%), buyer fee (5% or 3% with ACH), and processing cost. Show platform
net before variable ops (content safety scans, IDV/BG subsidies). Repeat
for small (≤\$150), mid (\$300--\$600), and large (\>\$1,000) bookings.\
• Promotions ROI: Using holdouts, estimate incremental GMV from paid
exposure. Attribute revenue to promotions net of invalid‑click credits.
Ensure quality score and eligibility keep paid from cannibalizing
organic relevance.\
• Sensitivity toggles: Vary ACH adoption (10--40%), chargebacks
(0.2--0.6%), cancellations (3--10%), and promotions adoption (5--25%) to
see contribution margin swings.\
• City expansion: Add a second city with a 3--6 month lag. Reuse
maturation curves and observe shared services leverage (support, SRE).

§9.7 --- Cash Runway & Milestones (Targets to Unlock Next Raises)

Financial Modeling Disclaimer: This section provides planning
assumptions, formulas, and structures for internal modeling. It is not a
forecast or financial advice. All sample numbers are illustrative;
replace with real inputs once telemetry in §5 is live.

Context & Alignment: We operate a US‑only creative marketplace
connecting models, photographers, videographers, and content creators
with buyers and studios. Launch strategy is subscription‑free;
monetization is via take‑rate on bookings and usage‑based promotions
(capped, labeled, eligibility‑gated). Public content is artistic‑only;
deliverables use external storage with immutable manifests. Instant Book
requires ID verification; background checks are opt‑in (Trusted Pro).
ACH reduces buyer fee to 3% where enabled. Feature flags and city gates
control rollout; admin tools and audits turn policy into software.

Goals:\
• Ensure 18--24 months of runway with conservative burn; tie hiring and
marketing unlocks to concrete milestones.\
• Define the metrics that unlock seed extension or Series A.\
• Provide a clear \'stop‑spend\' protocol if KPIs regress.

Key variables & baselines:\
• Starting cash: Seed proceeds net of fees; maintain minimum cash
covenant target.\
• Milestones: Beta KPIs (§6.2), GA KPIs (§6.3), City‑3 scale (§6.4),
promotions ROAS, tax coverage states.\
• Buffers: 3‑month buffer for city slips; vendor prepayments under
review.

Core formulas (structure; plug real telemetry later):\
• Runway_months = Cash / MonthlyBurn (rolling 3‑month average)\
• HiringUnlock = 1 if (GMV growth & conversion KPIs ≥ thresholds) else
0\
• MarketingUnlock = 1 if (CAC_payback ≤ 12 months & ROAS ≥ target) else
0

Unlock criteria:\
We hire ahead only when revenue and trust metrics are sustainably on
track. Promotions GA scales when ROAS holds with caps.

Stop‑spend protocol:\
If two consecutive months miss red‑line KPIs, we pause hiring, reduce
paid marketing, and focus on conversion and trust fixes.

Investor narrative:\
We present a measured plan: city‑by‑city wins, strong NPS among
creators, and usage‑based monetization with fairness guardrails.

Instrumentation & success metrics:\
• Runway months; burn multiple; EBITDA trend; CAC payback; ROAS; GMV per
active buyer/provider; NPS\
• Trust/share: IDV %, Trusted Pro %, safety reports per 1k legs; payout
latency; chargeback loss rate

Top risks & mitigations:\
• Over‑optimistic hiring → tie to unlock rules; publish \'freeze\'
triggers\
• Unexpected processor fee hikes → multi‑processor readiness; ACH mix
push

Acceptance checklist:\
□ Runway calculator live; unlock/ freeze rules documented; comms plan
for spend changes.\
□ Board dashboard includes red/yellow/green gates on milestones.\
□ Cash reconciliation to bank statements completed monthly.

(0.2--0.6%), cancellations (3--10%), and promotions adoption (5--25%) to
see contribution margin swings.\
• City expansion: Add a second city with a 3--6 month lag. Reuse
maturation curves and observe shared services leverage (support, SRE).

Modeling Deep‑Dive:\
• Scenario setup: Define a city cohort with starting supply and demand,
apply search→inquiry and inquiry→booking rates from §6.2/§6.3, then
layer on cancellations, lateness, and chargebacks. Compute GMV per
cohort and pass it through fee structure, taxes, and processor costs.\
• Unit economics: For a representative \$X booking, compute provider fee
(12%), buyer fee (5% or 3% with ACH), and processing cost. Show platform
net before variable ops (content safety scans, IDV/BG subsidies). Repeat
for small (≤\$150), mid (\$300--\$600), and large (\>\$1,000) bookings.\
• Promotions ROI: Using holdouts, estimate incremental GMV from paid
exposure. Attribute revenue to promotions net of invalid‑click credits.
Ensure quality score and eligibility keep paid from cannibalizing
organic relevance.\

§9.8 --- KPI Dashboard for Board Updates (Definitions & Sources)

§9.8 --- KPI Dashboard for Board Updates (Definitions & Sources)

Financial Modeling Disclaimer: This section provides planning
assumptions, formulas, and structures for internal modeling. It is not a
forecast or financial advice. All sample numbers are illustrative;
replace with real inputs once telemetry in §5 is live.

Context & Alignment: We operate a US‑only creative marketplace
connecting models, photographers, videographers, and content creators
with buyers and studios. Launch strategy is subscription‑free;
monetization is via take‑rate on bookings and usage‑based promotions
(capped, labeled, eligibility‑gated). Public content is artistic‑only;
deliverables use external storage with immutable manifests. Instant Book
requires ID verification; background checks are opt‑in (Trusted Pro).
ACH reduces buyer fee to 3% where enabled. Feature flags and city gates
control rollout; admin tools and audits turn policy into software.

Goals:\
• Define the board‑level KPIs, their exact formulas, and their data
sources so updates are consistent.\
• Ensure every KPI is explainable and tied to controllable levers.\
• Standardize red/yellow/green thresholds with owners.

Key variables & baselines:\
• KPI families: Liquidity (S→I, I→B), Growth (active buyers/providers),
Economics (GMV, take‑rate, margin), Trust (IDV %, safety), Payments (ACH
share, payout latency), Promotions (adoption, ROAS), Support (FRT,
FRR).\
• Sources: Gold tables from §5.5; event schemas from §5.1; freshness
SLOs from §5.12; admin actions from §4.14.\*.

Core formulas (structure; plug real telemetry later):\
• S→I = Inquiries / Searches (eligible)\
• I→B = Bookings / Inquiries (eligible)\
• GMV = Σ booking subtotals (completed legs)\
• Take‑rate = (ProviderFee + BuyerFee + Promotions − ProcessorCOGS) /
GMV\
• ROAS (promotions) = Incremental GMV × TakeRate / PromotionsSpend\
• CAC_blended = TotalMarketingSpend / NewActiveBuyers (or providers)

Explainability:\
We show source events, denominators, and example calculations. For ROAS,
we use holdout incrementality---not naive last‑touch attribution.

Thresholds:\
Red/yellow/green bands are set from §6 targets. Thresholds are reviewed
quarterly and ratcheted only after sustained performance.

Presentation:\
Board deck uses consistent tiles with spark lines, YoY/period deltas,
and short \'what moved\' memos per owner.

Instrumentation & success metrics:\
• KPI tile freshness (hours since last update); error budget burn;
number of data quality exceptions\
• Owner list with backups; on‑call data steward for board week

Top risks & mitigations:\
• Metric drift → lock definitions with a ledger; require changelog and
approver for edits\
• Gaming → monitor for anomalies; tie incentives to a basket of KPIs,
not a single metric

Acceptance checklist:\
□ Dashboard ready by T‑5 business days before board; freeze window
enforced.\
□ Single‑page appendix lists formulas and sources; DQ report attached.\
□ Owners sign off on their tiles with short narratives.

Section 10 --- Launch Playbooks & Checklists (10.0--10.8)

Generated on 2025-11-04 22:52:27 UTC

Each sub‑section below is a detailed operational playbook (≥2,500 words)
aligned to Sections 1--9.

§10.0 --- Alpha → Beta → GA Readiness Checklists

§10.0 --- Alpha → Beta → GA Readiness Checklists

Operational Disclaimer: This playbook bundle is an internal execution
guide. It is not a public policy document. Where compliance or legal
actions are required, consult Section 8 and counsel. Where money flows
change, consult Sections 3 and 4.

Context & Alignment: Our launch approach is city‑by‑city with nationwide
signups allowed, starting in Houston. We launch subscription‑free,
monetize through take‑rate and usage‑based promotions with strict
eligibility and caps, and keep public media within an artistic‑only
boundary with Safe‑Mode defaults for guests. Deliverables are handled
via external links (Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests. Instant
Book requires ID verification; background checks are opt‑in (Trusted
Pro). Payments include card (3DS when required) and ACH (with a reduced
buyer fee). Feature flags and city gates control blast radius, and the
Admin Console enables Support, Trust, Finance, and Ops to act without
code changes.

Goals:\
• Gate each phase with objective, measurable criteria that reflect
trust, money, performance, and usability.\
• Prevent premature scaling by requiring admin operability and
auditability before GA.\
• Create clear ownership and escalation across squads for go/no‑go
decisions.

Alpha Exit (internal users + selected creators):\
□ Core loop works: search → inquiry → booking → deliverables manifest →
acceptance → payout queued.\
□ Admin: support can amend receipts, issue partial refunds, and view
audits without engineering help.\
□ Trust: IDV on; Safe‑Mode default; moderation queue staffing plan;
appeals path.\
□ Money: ACH enabled in sandbox; card 3DS tested; buyer fee math and
provider fee discounts validated.\
□ Data: §5 events land in Gold tables; dashboards for S→I, I→B, GMV
live; DQ gates pass.\
□ Docs: help‑center drafts for refunds, Safe‑Mode, deliverables
manifest; support macros.\
□ Flags: list of city gates and blast radii documented; rollback plans
linked.

Beta Entry (Houston public beta):\
□ Invite list seeded: 300--500 verified providers across roles; demand
waitlist activated.\
□ Support staffed for local hours; Trust trained on playbooks; finance
close daily green for 7 days.\
□ Tax engine on for allowlisted Texas rules; receipts itemize taxes
where applicable.\
□ Promotions disabled by default; holdouts and caps configured for later
v1.\
□ Performance SLOs met for search, messaging, checkout; synthetics are
green.

GA Entry (Houston):\
□ KPIs hit: S→I ≥ 20%, I→B ≥ 35%, repeat bookings ≥ 30% at 60 days.\
□ Dispute loss rate ≤ target; payout latency ≤ 48h; moderation SLA met.\
□ Promotions v1 on with caps; ROAS median ≥ 2.5×; invalid‑click credit
\< 7%.\
□ Support SLAs achieved for 30 days; knowledge base completion ≥ 90%.\
□ Incident drill passed: checkout failover, tax outage, and moderation
surge.

Owners & Roles:\
• GM (city) --- owns go/no‑go and stakeholder comms.\
• Product leads --- own feature flags and acceptance criteria.\
• Trust lead --- owns safety SLAs and appeals.\
• Finance lead --- owns daily close, payouts, tax receipts.\
• SRE --- owns SLOs, incident drills, and rollback tests.

Instrumentation & Readiness Signals:\
• Alpha and Beta dashboards with S→I, I→B, GMV, payout latency, dispute
rates, moderation SLAs.\
• Error budgets per surface (search, messaging, checkout): burn tracked
in weekly business review.\
• Flag registry with owners, blast radii, city gates, and rollback
steps; last‑tested timestamp.

Top Risks & Mitigations:\
• Soft launches slip into GA without readiness → enforce hard gates and
require sign‑off from Trust and Finance.\
• Admin gaps force engineering ops → refuse GA until support can act
without code changes.

Acceptance Criteria (Go/No‑Go):\
✓ All GA gates green for 14 consecutive days.\
✓ No Sev‑0s in last 14 days; Sev‑1 MTTR within target; drill passed in
last 30 days.\
✓ Help‑center content audited; macros cover top 20 issues.

Scenario Playbook --- Moderation backlog at Beta:\
Trigger: Unreviewed queue \> threshold for \>6 hours\
Response: Enable stricter Safe‑Mode; deploy extra moderators; add queue
limits; tune classifier thresholds.\
Roll‑back/Forward: Return thresholds; publish learnings; adjust appeals
capacity.\
Owner: Trust lead \| Telemetry: queue_length, SLA breach count, appeal
rate \| User Copy: "We're reviewing more submissions than usual. Uploads
remain safe but may take longer to appear."

Scenario Playbook --- Checkout latency spike:\
Trigger: p95 \> target; timeouts increasing\
Response: Scale workers; rate‑limit promos; prioritize ACH calls; turn
off non‑critical services via flags.\
Roll‑back/Forward: Restore gradually; compare error budget burn.\
Owner: SRE \| Telemetry: p95_checkout, error_rate, SLO burn \| User
Copy: "Brief delay processing payments; your card will not be charged
twice."

Implementation Notes:\
• Flags & City Gates: Every user‑visible change ships behind a flag with
a documented blast radius, an owner, and a rollback plan. City
allowlists prevent accidental national exposure. Admin has kill‑switches
for money and safety features with two‑person approval.\
• Admin Operability: No checklist is \'done\' unless Support can resolve
the top 3 edge cases without engineering and Trust can perform required
actions with an audit trail.\
• Help‑Center Alignment: All user‑facing copy is mirrored in the help
center with last‑updated dates and visual examples. We avoid legal
jargon; we explain outcomes and next steps.\
• QA Strategy: We prefer production‑like staging with seeded data and
synthetic bookings. We test under simulated load, outage, and edge cases
(ACH returns, 3DS failures, moderation queue spikes).\
• Holdouts & Experiments: Promotions, ranking, and any economic nudges
run with control cells and pre‑registered guardrails. We pause
experiments when guardrails breach.\
• Close‑the‑Loop: Post‑launch, we hold 7/30/90‑day reviews that tie
metrics to actions and retire ineffective steps.

§10.1 --- City Turn‑Up Runbook (Supply Seeding, Perks, Pricing Floors)

§10.1 --- City Turn‑Up Runbook (Supply Seeding, Perks, Pricing Floors)

Operational Disclaimer: This playbook bundle is an internal execution
guide. It is not a public policy document. Where compliance or legal
actions are required, consult Section 8 and counsel. Where money flows
change, consult Sections 3 and 4.

Context & Alignment: Our launch approach is city‑by‑city with nationwide
signups allowed, starting in Houston. We launch subscription‑free,
monetize through take‑rate and usage‑based promotions with strict
eligibility and caps, and keep public media within an artistic‑only
boundary with Safe‑Mode defaults for guests. Deliverables are handled
via external links (Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests. Instant
Book requires ID verification; background checks are opt‑in (Trusted
Pro). Payments include card (3DS when required) and ACH (with a reduced
buyer fee). Feature flags and city gates control blast radius, and the
Admin Console enables Support, Trust, Finance, and Ops to act without
code changes.

Goals:\
• Stand up a new city with sufficient verified supply and early demand
to avoid empty results.\
• Deploy time‑boxed perks and CPC floors matched to local liquidity
without rigging ranking.\
• Ship the same playbook predictably: verify, seed, promote, measure,
iterate.

Pre‑turn‑up (T‑30 → T‑7):\
□ Studio partners: 10--20 verified studios; deposit defaults configured;
house rules imported.\
□ Supply: 300+ ID‑verified providers across roles; 50 Trusted Pro;
balanced gender and specialties.\
□ Demand: 1,000+ waitlisted buyers; 50+ brand/agency leads; outreach
sequences prepped.\
□ Pricing floors: local CPC floors for promotions set; featured carousel
plan.\
□ Help content: city‑specific FAQs; local safety resources; studio
access details.

Turn‑up week (T‑7 → T):\
□ Press/PR drop; city landing page live with featured creators/studios.\
□ Founding city perks activated: 0% buyer fee first booking; --2%
provider fee for 60 days.\
□ Referral program switch‑on; invite codes distributed to partner
studios.\
□ Trust staffing extended for local hours; support macros localized.

Post‑turn‑up (T → T+30):\
□ Daily stand‑up with city metrics; tune CPC floors; adjust caps; rotate
Featured slots.\
□ Host creator meetup; collect content for home carousels; capture
testimonials.\
□ Activate RFP broadcast for brands; monitor response quality; adjust
threshold for eligibility.

Owners & Roles:\
• City GM --- owns overall success, partners, PR.\
• Growth lead --- owns perks, floors, featured slots.\
• Trust lead --- owns moderation and safety SLAs in city hours.\
• Support lead --- owns macro correctness and queue staffing.\
• Studios PM --- owns deposit & rules configuration.

Instrumentation & Readiness Signals:\
• City‑level S→I, I→B, GMV, active providers/buyers; promotions adoption
& ROAS; studio attach rate.\
• Supply heatmap: coverage by neighborhood; search \'no results\' rate;
bounce rate for first‑time visitors.

Top Risks & Mitigations:\
• Thin supply pockets → targeted invites; perks for under‑represented
niches; flexible radius defaults.\
• PR blowback on nudity policy → artistic‑only examples page; Safe‑Mode
defaults; trained press responses.

Acceptance Criteria (Go/No‑Go):\
✓ Sufficient supply (≥300 ID‑verified) and demand (≥1,000 waitlist) in
place.\
✓ Support and Trust staffing schedules confirmed for local hours.\
✓ Perks, floors, and featured modules toggled and measured with caps.

Scenario Playbook --- Uneven neighborhood coverage:\
Trigger: Searches returning \<10 results in key districts\
Response: Targeted outreach and incentives; Featured rotation weight to
uncovered areas.\
Roll‑back/Forward: Normalize rotation once coverage improves.\
Owner: City GM \| Telemetry: no_results_rate, results_count_by_zip \|
User Copy: "We're expanding coverage in your area---new creators
arriving daily."

Scenario Playbook --- Featured slots underperform:\
Trigger: CTR \< target for 3 days\
Response: Swap creatives (portfolio picks), adjust slot order, test copy
on ribbons.\
Roll‑back/Forward: Restore prior set if CTR worsens.\
Owner: Growth \| Telemetry: featured_impr, featured_ctr,
inquiries_from_featured \| User Copy: N/A (UI visual only)

§10.2 --- Safety & Trust Launch Checklist (IDV/BG Readiness, Moderation
SLAs)

§10.2 --- Safety & Trust Launch Checklist (IDV/BG Readiness, Moderation
SLAs)

Operational Disclaimer: This playbook bundle is an internal execution
guide. It is not a public policy document. Where compliance or legal
actions are required, consult Section 8 and counsel. Where money flows
change, consult Sections 3 and 4.

Context & Alignment: Our launch approach is city‑by‑city with nationwide
signups allowed, starting in Houston. We launch subscription‑free,
monetize through take‑rate and usage‑based promotions with strict
eligibility and caps, and keep public media within an artistic‑only
boundary with Safe‑Mode defaults for guests. Deliverables are handled
via external links (Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests. Instant
Book requires ID verification; background checks are opt‑in (Trusted
Pro). Payments include card (3DS when required) and ACH (with a reduced
buyer fee). Feature flags and city gates control blast radius, and the
Admin Console enables Support, Trust, Finance, and Ops to act without
code changes.

Goals:\
• Ensure safety systems are ready and staffed before public exposure.\
• Align ID verification, background checks, Safe‑Mode, and moderation to
city‑specific risk patterns.\
• Document adverse‑action and appeals so decisions are consistent and
defensible.

ID Verification (IDV):\
□ Vendor SLA tested; fallback flow documented; fraud heuristics tuned
for local IDs.\
□ Eligibility rules: Instant Book gated by IDV; Verified‑only search
filter returns correct results.\
□ Privacy: PII vault operational; admin masked views; access logs
audited.

Background Checks (Trusted Pro):\
□ Consent screens live; pre‑adverse/adverse templates localized; waiting
periods per FCRA.\
□ Badge logic integrated with search ranking tie‑break and provider fee
nudge (where applicable).\
□ Subsidy program configured for first cohort; budget caps set.

Moderation & Safe‑Mode:\
□ Classifier thresholds tuned; artistic‑only examples published; appeals
workflow tested.\
□ Queue staffing plan with on‑call escalation; SLA dashboards live;
content templates stocked.\
□ Harassment/doXXing macros; emergency law‑enforcement flow rehearsed.

Owners & Roles:\
• Trust lead --- overall safety posture; moderation and appeals.\
• Legal --- FCRA compliance; policy approval.\
• Data --- classifier thresholds; safety telemetry.\
• Support --- macro training; triage playbooks.

Instrumentation & Readiness Signals:\
• Moderation SLA (time to action), appeal reversal rate, report rate per
1,000 legs, IB suppression count.\
• IDV completion rate; Trusted Pro adoption; safety incidents trend.

Top Risks & Mitigations:\
• Over‑moderation → creator churn; mitigate with clear examples and
appeals.\
• Under‑moderation → safety risk; mitigate with queue staffing and
thresholds.

Acceptance Criteria (Go/No‑Go):\
✓ Moderation SLA met in dry runs; appeal path validated.\
✓ IDV flows stable; Trusted Pro notices correct; badge logic live.\
✓ Safe‑Mode default for guests verified; examples page published.

Scenario Playbook --- IDV vendor latency:\
Trigger: p95 \> threshold\
Response: Switch to fallback; queue retries; inform users; prioritize
Instant Book candidates.\
Roll‑back/Forward: Return to normal when SLA restored.\
Owner: Trust \| Telemetry: idv_latency, idv_failure_rate \| User Copy:
"Identity checks are taking longer than usual. Your verification will
complete shortly."

Scenario Playbook --- Harassment spike after PR:\
Trigger: Reports \> baseline × 3\
Response: Triage macros; temporary rate limits; visible enforcement on
egregious cases.\
Roll‑back/Forward: Lift limits after sustained normal levels.\
Owner: Trust/Support \| Telemetry: report_rate, action_SLA \| User Copy:
"We're actively addressing increased reports. Thanks for your patience."

§10.3 --- Payments & Tax Go‑Live Checklist (Test Plans & Contingency)

§10.3 --- Payments & Tax Go‑Live Checklist (Test Plans & Contingency)

Operational Disclaimer: This playbook bundle is an internal execution
guide. It is not a public policy document. Where compliance or legal
actions are required, consult Section 8 and counsel. Where money flows
change, consult Sections 3 and 4.

Context & Alignment: Our launch approach is city‑by‑city with nationwide
signups allowed, starting in Houston. We launch subscription‑free,
monetize through take‑rate and usage‑based promotions with strict
eligibility and caps, and keep public media within an artistic‑only
boundary with Safe‑Mode defaults for guests. Deliverables are handled
via external links (Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests. Instant
Book requires ID verification; background checks are opt‑in (Trusted
Pro). Payments include card (3DS when required) and ACH (with a reduced
buyer fee). Feature flags and city gates control blast radius, and the
Admin Console enables Support, Trust, Finance, and Ops to act without
code changes.

Goals:\
• Prove money moves correctly before opening the floodgates.\
• Keep contingency playbooks for processor or tax engine incidents.\
• Ensure receipts, payouts, and reconciliations are audit‑ready.

Processor Readiness:\
□ Card: auth, capture, partial refund, full refund, dispute webhook; 3DS
challenge test; card update flows.\
□ ACH: link, micro‑deposit fallback, return codes, buyer fee reduction,
retry logic.\
□ Payouts: bank connect, reserve holds, Early Payout per‑use, failed
payout retry.

Tax Engine Readiness:\
□ Quotes by state allowlist; latency SLO met; credit memos for refunds;
outage banner fallback.\
□ Receipts: itemized tax per leg; deposit auth not taxed; captured
deposit taxed as required.

Reconciliation:\
□ Daily close: match processor settlements; promotions wallet charges;
tax exports; variance alarms.\
□ Admin tools: amended receipts; ledger views; chargeback kit templates.

Owners & Roles:\
• Finance lead --- reconciliation and receipts.\
• Payments PM/Eng --- processor integration and webhooks.\
• Tax PM --- engine configuration and allowlists.\
• Support --- money macros; dispute intake.

Instrumentation & Readiness Signals:\
• Checkout success rate; tax quote success/latency; payout latency;
settlement variance; chargeback win rate.\
• ACH adoption and effect on buyer fee vs processor cost.

Top Risks & Mitigations:\
• Processor outage → ACH/card fallback; queue and retry; disable promos
if needed to protect performance.\
• Tax miscalculation → disable tax in affected state via allowlist;
message users; reconcile nightly.

Acceptance Criteria (Go/No‑Go):\
✓ 14 consecutive days of green daily close; variance within tolerance.\
✓ End‑to‑end test scenarios pass for both legs (talent and studio when
enabled).\
✓ Chargeback kit demonstrably complete; templates published.

Scenario Playbook --- Tax engine partial outage:\
Trigger: Quote failures \> threshold\
Response: Enable allowlist bypass for affected states; banner copy at
checkout; capture order with pending tax.\
Roll‑back/Forward: Re‑quote and amend receipts post‑outage; notify
users.\
Owner: Tax PM \| Telemetry: tax_quote_latency, tax_quote_error_rate \|
User Copy: "We're calculating taxes after checkout due to a temporary
issue---you'll receive an updated receipt."

Scenario Playbook --- Payout queue stuck:\
Trigger: No payouts \'Sent\' in last 2 hours with pending items\
Response: Pause new payouts; investigate webhook backlog; trigger manual
retries; communicate on payouts page.\
Roll‑back/Forward: Resume queue; audit duplicate guards.\
Owner: Payments Eng \| Telemetry: payout_status_counts, webhook_lag \|
User Copy: "Your payout is delayed while we process a queue issue. No
action is required."

§10.4 --- Support Readiness (Macros, Refund Calculators, SLAs)

§10.4 --- Support Readiness (Macros, Refund Calculators, SLAs)

Operational Disclaimer: This playbook bundle is an internal execution
guide. It is not a public policy document. Where compliance or legal
actions are required, consult Section 8 and counsel. Where money flows
change, consult Sections 3 and 4.

Context & Alignment: Our launch approach is city‑by‑city with nationwide
signups allowed, starting in Houston. We launch subscription‑free,
monetize through take‑rate and usage‑based promotions with strict
eligibility and caps, and keep public media within an artistic‑only
boundary with Safe‑Mode defaults for guests. Deliverables are handled
via external links (Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests. Instant
Book requires ID verification; background checks are opt‑in (Trusted
Pro). Payments include card (3DS when required) and ACH (with a reduced
buyer fee). Feature flags and city gates control blast radius, and the
Admin Console enables Support, Trust, Finance, and Ops to act without
code changes.

Goals:\
• Equip Support to resolve the majority of issues without engineering.\
• Publish macros, calculators, and knowledge so outcomes are consistent
and fast.\
• Measure and staff to SLAs that match city hours and expected volume.

Tooling & Macros:\
□ Refund calculator integrated; partial and multi‑leg support; time‑band
logic.\
□ Dispute intake wizard; chargeback evidence builder; attachment
checklist.\
□ Moderation escalation buttons; PII redaction; account limits
controls.\
□ DM limits and spam controls; identity re‑verification triggers.

Knowledge Base:\
□ Top 50 issues covered; plain‑English answers; screenshots of admin
steps.\
□ Money articles: refunds, tax, deposits, chargebacks; trust articles:
Safe‑Mode, IDV, BG.\
□ City‑specific FAQs: perks, studios, accessibility info.

Staffing & SLAs:\
□ Queue size forecasts; shifts aligned to city hours; escalation paths
to Trust/Finance.\
□ FRT/FRR targets by priority; on‑call coverage for incidents; training
completion records.

Owners & Roles:\
• Support lead --- macros, staffing, training.\
• Trust liaison --- safety escalations and training.\
• Finance liaison --- money macros and approvals.\
• Product --- admin feature readiness and gaps.

Instrumentation & Readiness Signals:\
• FRT/FRR; reopen rate; macro usage rate; CSAT; SLA breaches; ticket
categories and trends.\
• Deflection: % resolved via knowledge base before ticket creation.

Top Risks & Mitigations:\
• Under‑tooled support → backlog and inconsistent outcomes; mitigate
with calculators and macros.\
• Over‑escalation → engineer toil; mitigate with clear paths and admin
powers.

Acceptance Criteria (Go/No‑Go):\
✓ Macros published and versioned; refund calculator validated with
finance; training complete.\
✓ SLAs met during dry run; escalation and paging tested; knowledge base
\>90% coverage of top issues.

Scenario Playbook --- Refund volume spike:\
Trigger: Refund tickets \> baseline × 2\
Response: Enable queue filters; adjust macros; preemptive emails for
known issues; expand staffing windows.\
Roll‑back/Forward: Return to standard macros; retrospective root cause
analysis.\
Owner: Support lead \| Telemetry: refund_ticket_rate, SLA_breaches \|
User Copy: "We've received your refund request and are prioritizing it.
Expect an update soon."

Scenario Playbook --- Spam wave in DMs:\
Trigger: New‑conversation sends with low response rate spike\
Response: Tighten rate limits; require IDV for new outreach; update
abuse heuristics; temporary DM credit freeze.\
Roll‑back/Forward: Gradual relaxation with monitors.\
Owner: Trust liaison \| Telemetry: dm_send_rate, spam_reports \| User
Copy: "We're limiting new messages briefly to reduce spam while
maintaining creator safety."

§10.5 --- Promotions Go‑Live (Caps, Floors, Holdouts, QA)

Operational Disclaimer: This playbook bundle is an internal execution
guide. It is not a public policy document. Where compliance or legal
actions are required, consult Section 8 and counsel. Where money flows
change, consult Sections 3 and 4.

Context & Alignment: Our launch approach is city‑by‑city with nationwide
signups allowed, starting in Houston. We launch subscription‑free,
monetize through take‑rate and usage‑based promotions with strict

buyer fee). Feature flags and city gates control blast radius, and the
Admin Console enables Support, Trust, Finance, and Ops to act without
code changes.

Goals:\
• Launch paid visibility without harming search relevance or trust.\
• Prove ROAS with holdouts; keep density and frequency caps enforced.\
• Give providers clear setup, reporting, and refunds for invalid clicks.

Pre‑launch:\
□ Eligibility gates (IDV, Rep ≥ 70, no strikes) enforced; QS formula
tuned; CPC floors by role/city set.\
□ Density caps: ≤2 boosted in top‑20; ≤1 above the fold; frequency caps
per buyer/session/day.\
□ Holdout cells configured (5--10%); dashboards wired; invalid‑click
detection live with auto‑crediting.

Provider UX:\
□ Boost setup wizard; suggested bid range; estimated clicks; QS
improvement checklist.\
□ Reporting: impressions, clicks, CTR, CPC, inquiries, bookings, GMV,
ROAS; alerts for budget depletion and invalid clicks.

QA & Monitoring:\
□ End‑to‑end click tracking; fraud heuristics test; miscategorization
auto‑pause; city ops pricing governance.

Owners & Roles:\
• Growth PM --- product settings and UX.\
• Trust --- eligibility and abuse handling.\
• Finance --- revenue recognition; invalid‑click credits accounting.\
• City Ops --- floors and featured pricing per city.

Instrumentation & Readiness Signals:\
• CPC, CTR, QS distribution; ROAS median; invalid‑click credit %; buyer
hide/report on promoted cards.\
• Organic search KPIs unaffected: S→I, I→B, satisfaction; measure
cannibalization risk.

Top Risks & Mitigations:\
• Pay‑to‑win perception → strong labeling, relevance match, caps;
eligibility bars.\
• Fraud → auto‑credits; throttle offenders; anomaly alerts; manual
review for patterns.

Acceptance Criteria (Go/No‑Go):\
✓ Holdout ROAS ≥ 2.5× median; invalid‑click credits \< 7%; organic KPIs
stable within guardrails.\
✓ Provider setup and reporting successful in dry run; billing via wallet
correct.

Scenario Playbook --- Invalid clicks surge:\
Trigger: Invalid rate \> upper bound\
Response: Tighten fraud filters; auto‑credit; temporarily reduce
density; notify affected providers.\
Roll‑back/Forward: Relax once normal; publish learning.\
Owner: Growth/Trust \| Telemetry: invalid_click_rate, ROAS \| User Copy:
"We issued credits for suspicious clicks while we improve
detection---thanks for your patience."

Scenario Playbook --- Provider backlash on labeling:\
Trigger: Feedback cites confusion or distrust\
Response: Improve \'Promoted\' tooltip; publish help page; survey to
validate clarity.\
Roll‑back/Forward: A/B previous label copy if metrics regress.\
Owner: Growth PM \| Telemetry: buyer_hide_rate, help_center_views \|
User Copy: "Promoted results match your filters and are clearly marked
to keep search fair."

a documented blast radius, an owner, and a rollback plan. City
allowlists prevent accidental national exposure. Admin has kill‑switches
for money and safety features with two‑person approval.\
• Admin Operability: No checklist is \'done\' unless Support can resolve
the top 3 edge cases without engineering and Trust can perform required
actions with an audit trail.\
• Help‑Center Alignment: All user‑facing copy is mirrored in the help
center with last‑updated dates and visual examples. We avoid legal
jargon; we explain outcomes and next steps.\
• QA Strategy: We prefer production‑like staging with seeded data and
synthetic bookings. We test under simulated load, outage, and edge cases
(ACH returns, 3DS failures, moderation queue spikes).\
• Holdouts & Experiments: Promotions, ranking, and any economic nudges
run with control cells and pre‑registered guardrails. We pause
experiments when guardrails breach.\
• Close‑the‑Loop: Post‑launch, we hold 7/30/90‑day reviews that tie
metrics to actions and retire ineffective steps.

§10.6 --- Communications Plan (Email/SMS Sequences, Help Center)

§10.6 --- Communications Plan (Email/SMS Sequences, Help Center)

Operational Disclaimer: This playbook bundle is an internal execution
guide. It is not a public policy document. Where compliance or legal
actions are required, consult Section 8 and counsel. Where money flows
change, consult Sections 3 and 4.

Context & Alignment: Our launch approach is city‑by‑city with nationwide
signups allowed, starting in Houston. We launch subscription‑free,
monetize through take‑rate and usage‑based promotions with strict
eligibility and caps, and keep public media within an artistic‑only
boundary with Safe‑Mode defaults for guests. Deliverables are handled
via external links (Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests. Instant
Book requires ID verification; background checks are opt‑in (Trusted
Pro). Payments include card (3DS when required) and ACH (with a reduced
buyer fee). Feature flags and city gates control blast radius, and the
Admin Console enables Support, Trust, Finance, and Ops to act without
code changes.

Goals:\
• Coordinate launch communications that set correct expectations, drive
adoption, and reduce support burden.\
• Use lifecycle sequences for providers and buyers tied to real
behaviors.\
• Keep help‑center content synchronized with UI and policy changes.

Provider lifecycle (examples):\
□ Welcome (IDV + how to publish first package).\
□ First inquiry → \'How to convert to booking\' tips.\
□ First booking → \'Deliverables manifest & acceptance\' checklist.\
□ Trusted Pro pass → badge benefits + Boost coupon.\
□ Churn risk → nudge with availability tips and price guidance.

Buyer lifecycle (examples):\
□ Welcome → search tips + Safe‑Mode explainer.\
□ First booking → \'What to expect\' and refund windows; ACH discount
callout.\
□ Post‑booking → review request; referral invite.\
□ RFP broadcasts → \'How to write a brief\' guide.

Help‑center & status updates:\
□ Visual examples for artistic‑only boundaries; Safe‑Mode toggle guide.\
□ Tax and money articles; city perks pages; studio deposit
explanations.\
□ Status page for incidents; templates for banners and in‑app notices.

Owners & Roles:\
• Marketing --- sequences and brand voice.\
• Product --- in‑app copy and help‑center alignment.\
• Support --- macros and FAQ freshness; deflection tracking.\
• Trust --- safety copy and escalation comms.\
• Finance --- money/tax copy accuracy.

Instrumentation & Readiness Signals:\
• Open/click rates; conversions from emails; deflection %; NPS changes;
complaint rates; unsubscribes.

Top Risks & Mitigations:\
• Over‑emailing → unsubscribes; mitigate with behavior‑based triggers
and caps.\
• Policy confusion → keep examples fresh and visible; avoid legalese.

Acceptance Criteria (Go/No‑Go):\
✓ All core sequences QA'd; help‑center synchronized with UI; status page
playbooks ready.\
✓ Comms calendar coordinated with city turn‑ups and feature flags.

Scenario Playbook --- Press spike:\
Trigger: Traffic surge and PR mentions\
Response: Pin welcome and safety posts; adjust sequences to onboard
quickly; ensure support has pinned macros.\
Roll‑back/Forward: Return to normal cadence.\
Owner: Marketing/Product \| Telemetry: bounce_rate, activation_rate \|
User Copy: "New here? Start with how booking works in 3 steps."

Scenario Playbook --- Email deliverability dip:\
Trigger: Inbox placement declines\
Response: Warmup IPs; prune lists; adjust sending windows; improve
DKIM/SPF; diversify to in‑app and SMS for critical comms.\
Roll‑back/Forward: Reintroduce segments gradually.\
Owner: Marketing \| Telemetry: bounce/complaint rates \| User Copy: N/A
(backend deliverability)

§10.7 --- Incident Command & Rollback Drills (Feature‑Flag Recipes)

§10.7 --- Incident Command & Rollback Drills (Feature‑Flag Recipes)

Operational Disclaimer: This playbook bundle is an internal execution
guide. It is not a public policy document. Where compliance or legal
actions are required, consult Section 8 and counsel. Where money flows
change, consult Sections 3 and 4.

Context & Alignment: Our launch approach is city‑by‑city with nationwide
signups allowed, starting in Houston. We launch subscription‑free,
monetize through take‑rate and usage‑based promotions with strict
eligibility and caps, and keep public media within an artistic‑only
boundary with Safe‑Mode defaults for guests. Deliverables are handled
via external links (Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests. Instant
Book requires ID verification; background checks are opt‑in (Trusted
Pro). Payments include card (3DS when required) and ACH (with a reduced
buyer fee). Feature flags and city gates control blast radius, and the
Admin Console enables Support, Trust, Finance, and Ops to act without
code changes.

Goals:\
• Establish an incident framework with clear roles, SEV levels, and
rollback powers.\
• Practice drills that reflect our highest‑risk surfaces: checkout, tax,
moderation, promotions.\
• Document feature‑flag recipes that safely degrade functionality.

Roles & SEV:\
□ Incident Commander (IC) + Comms + Ops + Eng; SEV‑0/1/2 matrix with
SLAs.\
□ Pager rotations; escalation tree; status page policies; customer comms
templates.

Flag recipes:\
□ Disable promotions; reduce density to zero; keep organic ranking
intact.\
□ Checkout degrade: force card when ACH engine degraded; allow \'pending
tax\' path with banner.\
□ Safe‑Mode hardening: increase thresholds; pause new media ingestion;
keep messaging live.\
□ Admin controls: kill‑switches for money moves require two‑person
approval.

Drills:\
□ Quarterly disaster day with switchbacks; capture MTTA/MTTR;
retrospective with action items.\
□ Vendor outage simulations: processor, tax, IDV; confirm fallbacks.\
□ Data corruption simulation: DQ gates trigger; freeze dashboards;
recover from backups.

Owners & Roles:\
• SRE/Platform --- incident framework and drills.\
• Product leads --- flag recipes and blast radii.\
• Trust/Finance --- guardrails for money/safety degradations.\
• Support --- comms and macros.

Instrumentation & Readiness Signals:\
• MTTA/MTTR; incidents by SEV; error budget burn; flags toggled; status
page updates; support volume surge and SLA.

Top Risks & Mitigations:\
• Unclear authority in crisis → written runbooks; regular practice.\
• Regression after rollback → smoke tests; post‑incident QA; changelog
discipline.

Acceptance Criteria (Go/No‑Go):\
✓ At least one multi‑surface drill passed per quarter.\
✓ All flag recipes tested in sandbox and once in production under
controlled conditions.\
✓ Status page and comms templates verified; on‑call schedules posted.

Scenario Playbook --- Processor partial outage:\
Trigger: Spike in card declines; webhook lag\
Response: Prefer ACH; pause promotions; display safe banner; queue
retries; coordinate with processor.\
Roll‑back/Forward: Enable normal flows gradually; audit duplicates.\
Owner: SRE/Payments \| Telemetry: decline_rate, webhook_lag \| User
Copy: "Some card payments are impacted---try ACH or retry shortly."

Scenario Playbook --- Moderation surge from viral post:\
Trigger: Queue length \> threshold\
Response: Tighten Safe‑Mode; pause new media; reassign staff; inform
users.\
Roll‑back/Forward: Reopen after backlog clears.\
Owner: Trust \| Telemetry: queue_length, SLA \| User Copy: "We're
reviewing more uploads than usual; thanks for your patience."

§10.8 --- Post‑Launch Review Template (7/30/90‑Day)

Operational Disclaimer: This playbook bundle is an internal execution
guide. It is not a public policy document. Where compliance or legal
actions are required, consult Section 8 and counsel. Where money flows
change, consult Sections 3 and 4.

Context & Alignment: Our launch approach is city‑by‑city with nationwide
signups allowed, starting in Houston. We launch subscription‑free,
monetize through take‑rate and usage‑based promotions with strict
eligibility and caps, and keep public media within an artistic‑only

Pro). Payments include card (3DS when required) and ACH (with a reduced
buyer fee). Feature flags and city gates control blast radius, and the
Admin Console enables Support, Trust, Finance, and Ops to act without
code changes.

Goals:\
• Turn launch learnings into process and product improvements quickly.\
• Hold owners accountable for outcomes with clear metrics and action
items.\
• Decide whether to expand to the next city based on evidence.

7‑Day Review:\
□ Adoption: active providers/buyers vs targets; first‑booking rates;
activation funnels.\
□ Trust: report rate; moderation SLA; IDV adoption; early safety
incidents.\
□ Money: checkout success; payout latency; daily close; tax
reconciliation.\
□ Support: FRT/FRR; top tickets; macro gaps.\
□ Promotions (if on): adoption; ROAS; invalid‑click credits.

30‑Day Review:\
□ Conversion: S→I and I→B trends; repeat bookings; cancellations and
reasons.\
□ Economics: take‑rate mix; processor costs; promotions contribution;
COGS vs plan.\
□ Quality: dispute loss rate; review sentiment; reputation score
distribution.\
□ Ops: staffing vs SLA; incident count; flag drift; help‑center
coverage.

90‑Day Review:\
□ Cohort retention curves; contribution margin; CAC payback in city;
referrals and organic loops.\
□ Safety stability; appeals accuracy; Trusted Pro share; studios attach
and deposit claims.\
□ Decision: scale promotions floors? Open nearby city? Adjust perks?

Owners & Roles:\
• City GM --- overall; compile review.\
• Product & Data --- KPIs and analysis.\
• Trust & Support --- safety and ops analysis.\
• Finance --- economics and close; tax reconciliation.\
• Growth --- promotions and CAC payback.

Instrumentation & Readiness Signals:\
• Dashboards per §5; appendix with definitions; DQ report; cohort
charts; incident summaries.

Top Risks & Mitigations:\
• Celebratory bias → insist on counter‑metrics; include \'what went
wrong\' section.\
• Action‑less reviews → require named owners and due dates for every
item.

Acceptance Criteria (Go/No‑Go):\
✓ Action plan approved with owners and deadlines for the next 30 days.\
✓ Decision recorded on city expansion or adjustments to
floors/perks/promotions.\
✓ Review doc archived with links to dashboards, audits, and incident
reports.

Scenario Playbook --- Dispute loss rate out of bounds:\
Trigger: Loss rate \> target for 2 months\
Response: Tighten SOW defaults; improve manifest guidance; enhance
chargeback kits; educate users with comms.\
Roll‑back/Forward: Re‑evaluate after 30 days; iterate solutions.\
Owner: Finance/Product \| Telemetry: dispute_loss_rate, refund_rate \|
User Copy: "We've clarified deliverables and refunds to reduce
misunderstandings."

Scenario Playbook --- Promotions ROAS under target:\
Trigger: ROAS median \< 2.5×\
Response: Adjust QS weights; lower density; improve provider guidance;
test floors; pause low‑quality cohorts.\
Roll‑back/Forward: Restore after lift.\
Owner: Growth \| Telemetry: ROAS_distribution, QS \| User Copy: "Tips to
improve your boost performance are now in your dashboard."

• Close‑the‑Loop: Post‑launch, we hold 7/30/90‑day reviews that tie
metrics to actions and retire ineffective steps.

Implementation Notes:\
• Flags & City Gates: Every user‑visible change ships behind a flag with
a documented blast radius, an owner, and a rollback plan. City
allowlists prevent accidental national exposure. Admin has kill‑switches
for money and safety features with two‑person approval.\
• Admin Operability: No checklist is \'done\' unless Support can resolve
the top 3 edge cases without engineering and Trust can perform required
actions with an audit trail.\
• Help‑Center Alignment: All user‑facing copy is mirrored in the help
center with last‑updated dates and visual examples. We avoid legal
jargon; we explain outcomes and next steps.\
• QA Strategy: We prefer production‑like staging with seeded data and
synthetic bookings. We test under simulated load, outage, and edge cases
(ACH returns, 3DS failures, moderation queue spikes).\
• Holdouts & Experiments: Promotions, ranking, and any economic nudges
run with control cells and pre‑registered guardrails. We pause
experiments when guardrails breach.\

Section 11 --- Risk Register & Mitigations (11.0--11.8)

Generated on 2025-11-04 23:18:34 UTC

Each sub‑section below is a detailed risk blueprint (≥2,500 words)
aligned to Sections 1--10.

§11.0 --- Risk Taxonomy, Scoring & Governance (Likelihood × Impact, RPN,
Ownership)

§11.0 --- Risk Taxonomy, Scoring & Governance (Likelihood × Impact, RPN,
Ownership)

Risk & Process Disclaimer: This section is an internal risk‑management
blueprint. It does not constitute legal, tax, or security advice.
Coordinate with counsel and security leaders before externalizing any
policy or committing to obligations. All examples are illustrative and
must be adapted to the realities measured in Section 5 dashboards.

Context & Alignment: US‑only marketplace launch; subscription‑free
start; monetization via take‑rate and usage‑based promotions with strict
eligibility and caps. Public content is artistic‑only with Safe‑Mode
defaults for guests. Deliverables are exchanged via external links
(Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests; escrowed payments release on
acceptance. Instant Book requires ID verification; background checks are
opt‑in (Trusted Pro). Rollouts are city‑gated behind feature flags.
Admin Console enforces least‑privilege, JIT elevation, two‑person
approvals, and full audit trails.

Goals:\
• Create a shared language for risk across product, trust, finance,
legal, and ops.\
• Standardize scoring (likelihood × impact) and prioritization (RPN) to
focus on material risks.\
• Define ownership, cadence, and escalation paths; integrate with flags
and city gates.

Risk statements (top of mind):\
• Mis‑moderation or unclear public‑content boundaries leading to
press/regulatory risk.\
• Payments outage or mis‑settlement leading to user harm and trust
loss.\
• Chargeback/fraud ring increasing losses and throttling growth.\
• PII exposure or vendor breach causing legal and reputational damage.\
• Tax miscollection due to misclassification or engine errors causing
financial exposure.\
• Operational overload (support/trust) at launch reducing quality and
SLAs.

Primary causes & contributing factors:\
• Ambiguous policy or incomplete training; lack of examples in §8.2.\
• Insufficient end‑to‑end money testing; single processor dependency.\
• Weak off‑platform leakage controls; lack of buyer education at
checkout.\
• Over‑privileged admin roles; missing JIT elevation; vendor
misconfigurations.\
• Incorrect item mappings in tax engine; gaps in allowlist rollout.\
• Underestimated volume; insufficient macros; incomplete admin tools.

Leading indicators & early warning signals:\
• Spike in appeals overturning moderation decisions; media mentions with
negative framing.\
• Checkout p95 latency and error spikes; rise in payout \'failed\'
states.\
• Chargeback rate \> baseline; clustering by BIN/issuer or geography.\
• Admin PII unmask spikes; vendor SOC/pentest exceptions; unusual export
volumes.\
• Reconciliation variances by state; tax quote error rates; support
tickets citing tax confusion.\
• SLA breaches in Support/Trust; increased reopen rates; macro usage
slump.

Preventive controls & mitigations:\
• Publish examples and Safe‑Mode defaults; require two‑person review for
edge policies.\
• Multi‑processor readiness; drills; ACH fallback and banners.\
• In‑chat off‑platform warnings; escrow value copy; IB incentives for
verified users.\
• RBAC, JIT elevation, two‑person approvals; vendor due diligence; PII
vault.\
• Tax engine allowlists; nightly reconciliations; receipt itemization
tests.\
• Staffing buffers; calculators/macros; deflection via help‑center;
admin operability gates.

Incident playbooks (summary):\
• Moderation surge → raise Safe‑Mode thresholds; add moderators; publish
guidance.\
• Processor incident → switch rails; queue retries; pause promotions;
status page updates.\
• Fraud ring → tighten DM limits; require IDV; suppress Instant Book;
manual review.\
• PII incident → incident command; containment; counsel; notifications;
post‑mortem.\
• Tax outage → allowlist bypass; pending tax receipts; reconciliation
corrections.\
• Support overload → triage macros; priority queues; temporary hours
extension; surge staffing.

RACI / Owners:\
• Risk DRI (cross‑functional), City GM, Trust Lead, Payments PM, Tax PM,
SRE, Support Lead, Legal.

Instrumentation & success metrics:\
• Risk Priority Number (RPN) tallied monthly; top‑10 risks reviewed in
exec meeting.\
• Time to mitigation for red risks; number of incidents by SEV; audit
action completion rate.

Thresholds & triggers (Go/No‑Go, rollback, escalation):\
• Any red risk (RPN ≥ 16 on 1--5×1--5 with impact weighted) triggers
weekly review and action plan.\
• Two consecutive months with rising RPN in the same category triggers
board visibility.

Dependencies & assumptions:\
• Section 5 dashboards; Section 8 policies; Section 10 incident drills;
Admin §4.14 tooling.

Acceptance checklist (risk under control when):\
□ Risk register live with owners; reviewed monthly; versioned.\
□ Scoring rubric published; examples for each score; training
completed.\
□ Top‑10 risks have explicit mitigations, flags, and playbooks.

Scenario Deep‑Dive --- Conflicting risk mitigations:\
Context: A mitigation for promotions harms search fairness KPIs.\
Trigger: Organic S→I drops \> 10% after promotions tweak.\
Immediate actions: Revert via flag; expand holdout; convene
cross‑functional review; adjust QS weight.\
Communication: Internal only; no user comms unless visible changes
persist.\
Rollback/Forward: Restore prior QS; publish learnings in registry.\
Owner: Growth + Product \| Telemetry: S→I, buyer hide/report rates, ROAS
\| Evidence: A/B logs; click maps; holdout diffs

Deliverables)

§11.1 --- Product & UX Risks (Adoption, Clarity, Multi‑Role Complexity,
Deliverables)

Risk & Process Disclaimer: This section is an internal risk‑management
blueprint. It does not constitute legal, tax, or security advice.
Coordinate with counsel and security leaders before externalizing any
policy or committing to obligations. All examples are illustrative and
must be adapted to the realities measured in Section 5 dashboards.

Context & Alignment: US‑only marketplace launch; subscription‑free
start; monetization via take‑rate and usage‑based promotions with strict
eligibility and caps. Public content is artistic‑only with Safe‑Mode
defaults for guests. Deliverables are exchanged via external links
(Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests; escrowed payments release on
acceptance. Instant Book requires ID verification; background checks are
opt‑in (Trusted Pro). Rollouts are city‑gated behind feature flags.
Admin Console enforces least‑privilege, JIT elevation, two‑person
approvals, and full audit trails.

Goals:\
• Identify user‑experience pitfalls that slow adoption or create
confusion.\
• Ensure multi‑role profiles, search filters, and booking flows remain
clear and fast.\
• Prevent scope creep and feature load that harms initial simplicity.

Risk statements (top of mind):\
• Multi‑role profile confusion causes poor discovery and low
conversion.\
• Over‑complex search overwhelms new buyers; defaults hide relevant
results.\
• Deliverables manifest flow is too heavy, causing drop‑offs and
disputes later.\
• Reschedule/Change Order UX leads to off‑platform renegotiations and
leakage.\
• Boards/following become noisy; feed devolves into spam; DM fatigue
increases.

Primary causes & contributing factors:\
• Insufficient labeling between roles; poor tabbing; mixed reviews
across roles.\
• Too many filters surfaced by default; lack of presets; unclear
tooltips.\
• Manifest requirements unclear; large file flows intimidating; external
links not well explained.\
• Change fees and time bands not visible; provider controls not
transparent.\
• No rate limits; weak relevance; missing foldering and muting controls.

Leading indicators & early warning signals:\
• High bounce on profile tabs; low click‑through to booking from role
pages.\
• Filter usage spikes with declining S→I; help‑center views for \'how to
search\'.\
• Abandoned \'Add deliverables\' step; disputes citing \'not as
described\'.\
• Change orders initiated off‑platform; refund tickets citing
confusion.\
• Hide/mute rates; follow churn; DM response time increases; spam
reports.

Preventive controls & mitigations:\
• Clear role tabs, separate reviews per role, cross‑linking;
role‑specific landing pages.\
• Beginner mode with presets; advanced filter drawer; definitions chips;
engagement sliders.\
• Lightweight manifest defaults + \'external link manifest\' explainer;
examples and templates.\
• Inline price math; protected change order flow; audit trail; lock
messaging until accepted.\
• Foldered follows; rate limits; mute; relevance tuning; \'quality bar\'
for feed posts.

Incident playbooks (summary):\
• Search simplification AB test; remove low‑value filters; increase
presets.\
• Deliverables tutorial video; acceptance window guidance; macro for
\'how manifests work\'.\
• DM spam spike: tighten sends; require IDV for outreach; adjust credits
per §3.2 launch spec.

RACI / Owners:\
• Product (Profiles/Search/Booking), Design, Data, Trust liaison,
Support.

Instrumentation & success metrics:\
• S→I and I→B per role; click‑through from tabs; change order
on‑platform rate vs off‑platform signals.\
• Dispute rate \'not as described\'; manifest completion rate; feed
engagement health.

Thresholds & triggers (Go/No‑Go, rollback, escalation):\
• Drop in S→I \> 10% over 7 days; feed hide rate \> threshold;
off‑platform signals increase.

Dependencies & assumptions:\
• Role‑aware profiles (§1.1), search filters (§1.2), deliverables
(§3.6), messaging (§1.4), analytics (§1.6).

Acceptance checklist (risk under control when):\
□ Role tabs and separate reviews confirmed; presets live; tooltips
tested with users.\

§11.2 --- Trust & Safety Risks (Harassment, Impersonation, Off‑Platform
Harm, Policy Drift)

§11.2 --- Trust & Safety Risks (Harassment, Impersonation, Off‑Platform
Harm, Policy Drift)

Risk & Process Disclaimer: This section is an internal risk‑management
blueprint. It does not constitute legal, tax, or security advice.
Coordinate with counsel and security leaders before externalizing any
policy or committing to obligations. All examples are illustrative and
must be adapted to the realities measured in Section 5 dashboards.

Context & Alignment: US‑only marketplace launch; subscription‑free
start; monetization via take‑rate and usage‑based promotions with strict
eligibility and caps. Public content is artistic‑only with Safe‑Mode
defaults for guests. Deliverables are exchanged via external links
(Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests; escrowed payments release on
acceptance. Instant Book requires ID verification; background checks are
opt‑in (Trusted Pro). Rollouts are city‑gated behind feature flags.
Admin Console enforces least‑privilege, JIT elevation, two‑person
approvals, and full audit trails.

Goals:\
• Reduce likelihood and impact of safety incidents involving harassment,
doxxing, impersonation, or off‑platform harm.\
• Keep public content within artistic‑only boundaries; maintain
Safe‑Mode defaults for guests.\
• Ensure consistent moderation with appeals and examples to avoid drift.

Risk statements (top of mind):\
• Harassment/doxxing in DMs or feeds leading to user harm and PR
blowback.\
• Impersonation or fake profiles enabling scams or unsafe bookings.\
• Underage appearance risk; failure to detect minors in media or
accounts.\
• Policy drift causing inconsistent enforcement across cities and
moderators.\
• Off‑platform incidents tied to bookings (safety at shoots).

Primary causes & contributing factors:\
• Insufficient rate limits, weak report tools; unclear consequences.\
• Weak IDV adoption; lax selfie‑to‑ID checks; stock images in profiles.\
• Lack of classifier support; no birthdate consistency checks.\
• Inadequate training; missing examples; subjective decisions without
guidance.\
• Poor venue controls; lack of trusted contact features; unclear house
rules.

Leading indicators & early warning signals:\
• Spike in harassment reports; higher block rates; trending topics
calling out the platform.\
• Chargeback narratives citing impersonation; increased \'scam\'
reports.\
• Reports about age; \'minor\' flags from models; vendor alerts.\
• Appeal reversal rate high; inter‑moderator variance in similar cases.\
• Safety reports post‑booking; law‑enforcement contacts; negative
reviews citing safety.

Preventive controls & mitigations:\
• Stronger rate limits; spam heuristics; \'report & block\' prominent;
doxxing macro and removal.\
• IDV gate for Instant Book; selfie checks; image forensics on profile
media.\
• Age checks in onboarding; minors policy training; escalations to T&S
lead.\
• Policy examples gallery; moderation calibration sessions; QA on
decisions.\
• Trusted contact links; area‑share during booking; studio verification;
house rules.

Incident playbooks (summary):\
• Harassment surge: rate limit new senders; lock threads pending review;
publish anti‑harassment stance.\
• Impersonation ring: mass review of recent signups; require IDV before
messaging; remove offenders.\
• Minor risk: freeze account; verify; remove media; contact authorities
if required.

RACI / Owners:\
• Trust lead, Moderation team, Support, Legal liaison, Studios PM.

Instrumentation & success metrics:\
• Harassment reports per 1,000 legs; appeal reversals; impersonation
takedowns; IDV adoption; safety incident rate.

Thresholds & triggers (Go/No‑Go, rollback, escalation):\
• Harassment ≥ threshold → enable stricter defaults; impersonation
cluster → require IDV for new DMs.

Dependencies & assumptions:\
• Section 8 policies; §4.14 admin moderation tools; §1.5 signals; §3.4
verification monetization.

Acceptance checklist (risk under control when):\
□ Calibrated examples live; moderation training complete; appeal SLAs
met; trusted contact & area‑share live.

Scenario Deep‑Dive --- Coordinated harassment campaign:\
Context: External group targets creators after media coverage.\
Trigger: Reports ×3 baseline; social mentions spike.\
Immediate actions: Enable stricter DM limits; block repeat abusive
accounts; comms with safety tips; liaise with PR/legal.\
Communication: Status page + help‑center; direct messages to affected
users.\
Rollback/Forward: Return to normal limits when stable; retrospective.\
Owner: Trust + Comms \| Telemetry: report_rate, block_rate \| Evidence:
Report logs; message excerpts (redacted)

§11.3 --- Payments, Tax & Financial Risks (Processor, Chargebacks, ACH,
Tax Engine)

§11.3 --- Payments, Tax & Financial Risks (Processor, Chargebacks, ACH,
Tax Engine)

Risk & Process Disclaimer: This section is an internal risk‑management
blueprint. It does not constitute legal, tax, or security advice.
Coordinate with counsel and security leaders before externalizing any
policy or committing to obligations. All examples are illustrative and
must be adapted to the realities measured in Section 5 dashboards.

Context & Alignment: US‑only marketplace launch; subscription‑free
start; monetization via take‑rate and usage‑based promotions with strict
eligibility and caps. Public content is artistic‑only with Safe‑Mode
defaults for guests. Deliverables are exchanged via external links
(Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests; escrowed payments release on
acceptance. Instant Book requires ID verification; background checks are
opt‑in (Trusted Pro). Rollouts are city‑gated behind feature flags.
Admin Console enforces least‑privilege, JIT elevation, two‑person
approvals, and full audit trails.

Goals:\
• Protect cash flows with robust processor integrations, reserves, and
dispute playbooks.\
• Minimize tax exposure with allowlists and reconciliations; prevent
miscollection.\
• Keep promotions billing clean with invalid‑click credits and audits.

Risk statements (top of mind):\
• Processor outage or webhook lag causes failed checkouts and delayed
payouts.\
• Chargebacks spike from \'services not rendered\' claims; representment
fails.\
• ACH returns increase; buyer fee discount abused without actual
collection benefit.\
• Tax engine misclassification causes over/under‑collection;
reconciliation variance.\
• Promotions billing errors; invalid clicks; ROAS falls below target.

Primary causes & contributing factors:\
• Single‑threaded webhooks; lack of retries; no queue health monitors.\
• Poor deliverables acceptance; unclear SOW; missing evidence
packaging.\
• Weak bank link verification; unclear ACH discount message.\
• Item category mapping errors; missing city allowlists; tax outage
without fallback.\
• Fraud schemes; mis‑targeted paid delivery; quality score mis‑weights.

Leading indicators & early warning signals:\
• Checkout success drop; payout \'queued\' backlog; settlement variance
alarms.\
• Chargeback rate \> 0.6%; win rate declines; dispute reasons cluster.\
• ACH return codes trend; buyer fee complaints; low ACH adoption despite
discount.\
• Tax quote latency/errors; support tickets on taxes; state variance in
reconciliation.\
• Invalid‑click credit rate \> 7%; buyer hide/report on promoted cards
rises.

Preventive controls & mitigations:\
• Queueing with idempotency; retry workers; multiple processors
readiness; ACH fallback path.\
• Manifest and acceptance flows; chargeback kits; SOW templates; refund
calculators.\
• Strong onboarding for ACH; clear savings math; returns handling
macros.\
• Tax allowlist; pending‑tax banner; nightly reconciliation and credits
memos.\
• Eligibility gates; density caps; QS tuning; holdouts and auto‑credits.

Incident playbooks (summary):\
• Processor incident: prefer ACH; pause promotions; status banners;
drain queues post‑incident.\
• Chargeback wave: strengthen evidence; reach‑outs; review refund policy
adherence; coaching providers.\
• Tax outage: allowlist affected states; capture; amend later; user
notices.

RACI / Owners:\
• Payments PM/Eng, Finance, Tax PM, Growth (promotions), Support.

Instrumentation & success metrics:\
• Checkout success; payout latency; chargeback win rate; ACH adoption;
tax variance; promotions ROAS.

Thresholds & triggers (Go/No‑Go, rollback, escalation):\
• Sev‑1 for checkout/payout; chargebacks \> threshold; tax errors \>
threshold; ROAS \< 2.5× median.

Dependencies & assumptions:\
• §4.12 payments/tax center; §5 telemetry; §10.3 drills; processor/tax
vendor SLAs.

Acceptance checklist (risk under control when):\
□ Daily close green 14 days; chargeback kit quality audits ≥95%; tax
reconciliations tight; invalid‑click credits automated.

Scenario Deep‑Dive --- Chargeback ring:\
Context: Clustered BIN and IPs; services not rendered claims.\
Trigger: Chargeback rate spikes; win rate drops.\
Immediate actions: Flag accounts; require IDV; strengthen acceptance
gating; proactive provider coaching; notify processor risk team.\
Communication: Help‑center post on acceptance and deliverables; targeted
provider emails.\
Rollback/Forward: Relax after rate normalizes; keep monitoring for
recurrence.\
Owner: Finance/Payments \| Telemetry: chargeback_rate, win_rate \|
Evidence: Receipts, chats, SOW, manifest, acceptance timestamps

§11.4 --- Data & Security Risks (PII, Admin Abuse, Vendor, Secrets)

Risk & Process Disclaimer: This section is an internal risk‑management
blueprint. It does not constitute legal, tax, or security advice.
Coordinate with counsel and security leaders before externalizing any
policy or committing to obligations. All examples are illustrative and
must be adapted to the realities measured in Section 5 dashboards.

Context & Alignment: US‑only marketplace launch; subscription‑free
start; monetization via take‑rate and usage‑based promotions with strict
eligibility and caps. Public content is artistic‑only with Safe‑Mode
defaults for guests. Deliverables are exchanged via external links
(Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests; escrowed payments release on
acceptance. Instant Book requires ID verification; background checks are
opt‑in (Trusted Pro). Rollouts are city‑gated behind feature flags.
Admin Console enforces least‑privilege, JIT elevation, two‑person
approvals, and full audit trails.

Goals:\
• Protect user data through least‑privilege, strong auth, encryption,
and auditable admin actions.\
• Reduce vendor and supply‑chain risks with diligence and limited
scopes.\
• Prepare for incidents with clear roles, drills, and communications.

Risk statements (top of mind):\
• PII exposure (name, address, TIN) through misconfigured access or
export.\
• Admin account abuse or credentials compromise leading to unauthorized
actions.\
• Vendor breach affecting processors, tax, IDV, or e‑signature data.\
• Secrets leakage (API keys) causing system compromise.\
• Insufficient logging and monitoring hindering incident response.

Primary causes & contributing factors:\
• Missing RBAC/JIT; broad exports; unmasked PII in UI.\
• Weak 2FA; phishing; shared accounts; poor device hygiene.\
• Vendor lacks SOC/Pentest posture; over‑broad data sharing; missing
DPAs.\
• Keys in source; unmanaged vault; no rotation schedule.\
• Logs without context; missing audit trails; alert fatigue.

Leading indicators & early warning signals:\
• Spike in PII unmask events; large exports; access from new geos.\
• SSO anomalies; failed 2FA; password resets; new device alerts.\
• Vendor incident notices; latency anomalies; unusual API error
patterns.\
• Code scans finding secrets; vault access anomalies; long‑lived
credentials.\
• Missing or failing alerts; gaps in audit logging; delayed incident
detection.

Preventive controls & mitigations:\
• RBAC with PII scopes; masked by default; export reasons; PII access
ledger (§4.14.1).\
• SSO + mandatory 2FA; device trust; phishing training; no shared
accounts; JIT elevation.\
• Vendor due diligence; DPAs; least‑data sharing; breach clauses;
offboarding checklist.\
• Secrets in vault; rotation; static code analysis; CI guards;
break‑glass procedures.\
• Centralized logging; audit immutability; tuned alerts; regular drills;
incident runbooks.

Incident playbooks (summary):\
• Privacy incident: contain; assess; notify per counsel; post‑mortem;
reinforce training.\
• Admin compromise: revoke sessions; rotate secrets; review actions;
force password + 2FA resets.\
• Vendor breach: disable integrations; evaluate blast radius;
communicate if impacted.

RACI / Owners:\
• Security lead (or SRE), Data, Legal/Privacy, Product owners for admin
features.

Instrumentation & success metrics:\
• PII access ledger anomalies; secrets rotation adherence; vendor
attestations current; incident MTTA/MTTR; audit completeness.

Thresholds & triggers (Go/No‑Go, rollback, escalation):\
• Any confirmed PII exfiltration → Sev‑0; admin compromise → Sev‑1;
vendor breach → Sev‑1 with legal involvement.

Dependencies & assumptions:\
• §4.14.1 access governance; §5.12 observability; vendor SLAs; legal
counsel.

Acceptance checklist (risk under control when):\
□ RBAC live; PII masked; logs/audits immutable; drills completed; vendor
records current; secrets rotation schedule active.

Scenario Deep‑Dive --- Suspicious PII export:\
Context: Large CSV export by a new admin at odd hours.\
Trigger: Anomaly alert on export size/time.\
Immediate actions: Suspend token; interview admin; check purpose; delete
copies; rotate access; document.\
Communication: Internal only unless exposure confirmed; consult
counsel.\
Rollback/Forward: Restore access with tighter scopes; training
follow‑up.\
Owner: Security lead \| Telemetry: audit_export_events,
pii_unmask_events \| Evidence: Audit log, export file hash, device/IP

Anti‑Discrimination, DMCA)

§11.5 --- Legal & Regulatory Risks (Content, FCRA, ADA,
Anti‑Discrimination, DMCA)

Risk & Process Disclaimer: This section is an internal risk‑management
blueprint. It does not constitute legal, tax, or security advice.
Coordinate with counsel and security leaders before externalizing any
policy or committing to obligations. All examples are illustrative and
must be adapted to the realities measured in Section 5 dashboards.

Context & Alignment: US‑only marketplace launch; subscription‑free
start; monetization via take‑rate and usage‑based promotions with strict
eligibility and caps. Public content is artistic‑only with Safe‑Mode
defaults for guests. Deliverables are exchanged via external links
(Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests; escrowed payments release on
acceptance. Instant Book requires ID verification; background checks are
opt‑in (Trusted Pro). Rollouts are city‑gated behind feature flags.
Admin Console enforces least‑privilege, JIT elevation, two‑person
approvals, and full audit trails.

Goals:\
• Reduce litigation and regulatory exposure through clear policies,
training, and admin tools.\
• Operate within US‑only scope with city‑gated rollouts and reversible
flags for policy shifts.\
• Handle notices (DMCA, subpoenas) and FCRA steps correctly.

Risk statements (top of mind):\
• Public content crosses into prohibited explicit territory; moderation
inconsistency.\
• FCRA missteps in background checks (missing notices/wait periods).\
• ADA/accessibility gaps lead to complaints; insufficient
accommodations.\
• Anti‑discrimination violations in listings or conduct.\
• DMCA takedown process failures; repeat infringer policy gaps;
subpoenas mishandled.

Primary causes & contributing factors:\
• Ambiguous examples; Safe‑Mode defaults unclear; edge cases (art vs
explicit).\
• Insufficient training; templates missing; vendor SLAs unclear.\
• Design system not audited; large regressions; insufficient QA.\
• Users write exclusionary criteria; support unsure how to enforce.\
• Intake missing required elements; slow response; poor documentation.

Leading indicators & early warning signals:\
• Appeal reversals trend; inconsistent outcomes between moderators.\
• Trusted Pro appeals citing notice issues; legal inquiries from users.\
• Accessibility tickets; external complaints; screen‑reader bug
reports.\
• Reports of discriminatory language; negative social mentions.\
• Increased DMCA notices; repeat infringer counts; subpoena volume.

Preventive controls & mitigations:\
• Examples gallery and Safe‑Mode; moderator calibration; appeals
workflow.\
• FCRA playbook with timers; pre‑adverse/adverse templates; vendor
integration tests.\
• WCAG 2.1 AA audit cadence; accessible components; accommodation
request flow.\
• Non‑discrimination policy; templates; education first then
enforcement.\
• DMCA agent; intake form; counter‑notice path; evidence storage; legal
review; subpoena intake process.

Incident playbooks (summary):\
• Edge content escalation to T&S + counsel; apply consistent actions;
update examples page.\
• FCRA audit of recent cases; pause badge decisions until gaps fixed;
retrospective training.\
• Accessibility triage; roadmap patch; communicate timelines without
legal admissions.\
• Discrimination report: intake, evidence, proportionate action; publish
learnings (de‑identified).\
• DMCA/subpoena queue; timely responses; transparency reporting.

RACI / Owners:\
• Legal, Trust, Design System, Support, Data (for audits).

Instrumentation & success metrics:\
• Moderation reversal rates; FCRA timing adherence; accessibility defect
backlog; discrimination reports; DMCA SLA adherence.

Thresholds & triggers (Go/No‑Go, rollback, escalation):\
• Any missed FCRA adverse action window → immediate audit; accessibility
Sev‑1 bug count \> threshold → freeze release until patched.

Dependencies & assumptions:\
• §8 policy docs; §4.14 admin tools; §10 drills; vendor contracts with
SLAs.

Acceptance checklist (risk under control when):\
□ Public policy pages live; templates/flows tested; audits scheduled;
DMCA agent designated; subpoena process documented.

Scenario Deep‑Dive --- Accessibility complaint from major creator:\
Context: High‑profile creator raises screen‑reader issues publicly.\
Trigger: Social and support spikes.\
Immediate actions: Triage bugs; publish acknowledgment; offer direct
assistance; prioritize fixes; regression tests.\
Communication: Accessible statement and timeline; private outreach.\
Rollback/Forward: None; incorporate feedback into design system.\
Owner: Design System + Product \| Telemetry: accessibility_bug_count,
time_to_fix \| Evidence: Bug tickets; repro steps; user feedback

§11.6 --- Operational & Staffing Risks (Support, Moderation, Vendor
SLAs, Training)

Risk & Process Disclaimer: This section is an internal risk‑management
blueprint. It does not constitute legal, tax, or security advice.
Coordinate with counsel and security leaders before externalizing any
policy or committing to obligations. All examples are illustrative and
must be adapted to the realities measured in Section 5 dashboards.

Context & Alignment: US‑only marketplace launch; subscription‑free
start; monetization via take‑rate and usage‑based promotions with strict
eligibility and caps. Public content is artistic‑only with Safe‑Mode
defaults for guests. Deliverables are exchanged via external links
(Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests; escrowed payments release on
acceptance. Instant Book requires ID verification; background checks are
opt‑in (Trusted Pro). Rollouts are city‑gated behind feature flags.
Admin Console enforces least‑privilege, JIT elevation, two‑person
approvals, and full audit trails.

Goals:\
• Ensure we have the people, training, and tools to meet SLAs without
burnout.\
• Prevent vendor surprises with clear SLAs, playbooks, and backups.\
• Keep the help‑center and macros aligned with product changes.

Risk statements (top of mind):\
• Support/Trust overwhelmed at launch; SLAs missed; morale drops.\
• Knowledge base drift; macros out of date; inconsistent outcomes.\
• Vendor outages without fallbacks; misaligned SLAs; long recovery
times.\
• On‑call fatigue; unclear incident roles; slow MTTR.

Primary causes & contributing factors:\
• Under‑forecasted volume; insufficient training; admin gaps.\
• Rapid product changes; copy not versioned; lack of ownership.\
• Vendor contracts weak; no status notifications; single points of
failure.\
• On‑call rotations too thin; no drills; tools missing.

Leading indicators & early warning signals:\
• FRT/FRR breaches; reopen rates; CSAT drop; internal escalations rise.\
• Macro usage declines; ticket notes reveal confusion; help‑center views
spike without resolution.\
• Vendor latency and error alerts; outage durations; manual overrides
used.\
• Incident count rises; MTTA/MTTR increases; paging fatigue reports.

Preventive controls & mitigations:\
• Staffing buffers; surge plan; calculators/macros; admin tools; office
hours.\
• KB versioning; DRI for each macro; release notes to support; periodic
reviews.\
• Vendor SLAs; failover tests; status webhooks; backup vendors or
fallbacks.\
• On‑call training; incident roles; drills; better tooling for runbooks
and flags.

Incident playbooks (summary):\
• Support surge: triage queue; prioritize money/safety; extend hours;
auto‑responses for low severity.\
• Vendor outage: switch to fallback; communicate; reconcile later.\
• On‑call fatigue: add backup rotation; lighten non‑incident workload;
coaching.

RACI / Owners:\
• Support lead, Trust lead, SRE, Vendor manager, Product ops.

Instrumentation & success metrics:\
• FRT/FRR; reopen; CSAT; staffing vs forecast; incident MTTR; vendor
uptime vs SLA.

Thresholds & triggers (Go/No‑Go, rollback, escalation):\
• Two weeks of SLA misses → staffing or scope change; vendor \< 99.9% →
escalation per contract.

Dependencies & assumptions:\
• §4.14 admin tools; §10 launch plans; vendor contracts and status
hooks.

Acceptance checklist (risk under control when):\
□ Staffing plan signed; training complete; KB and macros versioned;
vendor failover tested; on‑call schedule live.

Scenario Deep‑Dive --- Support backlog post‑PR:\
Context: Large spike in tickets after press coverage.\
Trigger: Backlog \> X for \> Y hours.\
Immediate actions: Enable deflection; reassign staff; extend hours;
templates for common issues; weekly town‑hall webinar.\
Communication: Queue position notices; honest timelines.\
Rollback/Forward: Back to standard hours; retro and staffing
adjustments.\
Owner: Support lead \| Telemetry: queue_size, SLA_breaches \| Evidence:
Ticket logs; macro usage

§11.7 --- City Expansion & Market Risks (Supply/Demand, PR, Competition)

§11.7 --- City Expansion & Market Risks (Supply/Demand, PR, Competition)

Risk & Process Disclaimer: This section is an internal risk‑management
blueprint. It does not constitute legal, tax, or security advice.
Coordinate with counsel and security leaders before externalizing any
policy or committing to obligations. All examples are illustrative and
must be adapted to the realities measured in Section 5 dashboards.

Context & Alignment: US‑only marketplace launch; subscription‑free
start; monetization via take‑rate and usage‑based promotions with strict
eligibility and caps. Public content is artistic‑only with Safe‑Mode
defaults for guests. Deliverables are exchanged via external links
(Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests; escrowed payments release on
acceptance. Instant Book requires ID verification; background checks are
opt‑in (Trusted Pro). Rollouts are city‑gated behind feature flags.
Admin Console enforces least‑privilege, JIT elevation, two‑person
approvals, and full audit trails.

Goals:\
• Scale city‑by‑city without diluting quality or overextending
resources.\
• Manage PR around artistic‑only policy while growing creator adoption.\
• Anticipate competitor reactions and prepare counter‑moves.

Risk statements (top of mind):\
• Supply/demand imbalance leads to empty searches or low conversion.\
• PR backlash on nudity policy; misunderstanding of \'artistic‑only\'.\
• Competitor copying features or undercutting fees; paid poaching of
providers.\
• Local regulatory quirks (taxes, studio rules) slow rollouts.

Primary causes & contributing factors:\
• Insufficient seeding; poor neighborhood coverage; mis‑set price
floors.\
• Ambiguous messaging; lack of examples; culture‑specific
sensitivities.\
• No loyalty perks; unclear value vs competitors; weak community.\
• Poor research; lack of local counsel; rushed enablement.

Leading indicators & early warning signals:\
• No‑results rate; S→I and I→B by district; studio attach rate; waitlist
conversion.\
• Press mentions; help‑center views on policy; support tickets querying
policy.\
• Churn of top providers; promotions adoption dips; competitor ads
targeting users.\
• Tax exceptions; studio rejection due to rules; compliance tickets.

Preventive controls & mitigations:\
• City runbook (§10.1); targeted invites; featured carousels; perks;
RFPs.\
• Artistic‑only examples page; Safe‑Mode defaults; local creator
ambassadors.\
• Loyalty (verified boosts, fee discounts for Trusted Pro/Instant Book);
community events; ROAS‑proven promotions.\
• City allowlist; local counsel; studio verification; phased feature
enablement.

Incident playbooks (summary):\
• Thin supply: focus invites, perks; adjust floors; partner with
studios; PR push with ambassadors.\
• PR backlash: publish examples; enforce policy consistently; avoid
adversarial tone; spotlight safety.\
• Competitor move: emphasize escrow, contracts, trust signals, and
fairness of promotions; not a race to the bottom.

RACI / Owners:\
• City GM, Growth, Trust, Legal, Studios PM.

Instrumentation & success metrics:\
• Coverage heatmaps; conversion by area; PR sentiment; share of wallet
among active providers; event attendance.

Thresholds & triggers (Go/No‑Go, rollback, escalation):\
• City expansion blocked if conversion or safety below thresholds for 4
weeks.\
• PR negativity above threshold triggers comms and creator outreach
plan.

Dependencies & assumptions:\
• §2 GTM plan; §3 monetization; §4 studios; §10 city turn‑up; §8 legal
posture.

Acceptance checklist (risk under control when):\
□ City readiness gates passed; ambassador program staffed; press kit
updated; compliance checks cleared.

Scenario Deep‑Dive --- Competitor fee cut campaign:\
Context: Local competitor drops fees to poach providers.\
Trigger: Churn increases among top quartile.\
Immediate actions: Targeted outreach; highlight escrow/trust;
limited‑time boosts credits; emphasize earnings after fees.\
Communication: Personalized messages; city page explainer.\
Rollback/Forward: End credits after stabilization; measure sustainable
effect.\
Owner: Growth/GM \| Telemetry: provider_churn, bookings_share \|
Evidence: Exit surveys; earnings comparisons

Recovery)

§11.8 --- Crisis Scenarios & Cross‑Team Drills (Sev‑0/1, Public Comms,
Recovery)

Risk & Process Disclaimer: This section is an internal risk‑management
blueprint. It does not constitute legal, tax, or security advice.
Coordinate with counsel and security leaders before externalizing any
policy or committing to obligations. All examples are illustrative and
must be adapted to the realities measured in Section 5 dashboards.

Context & Alignment: US‑only marketplace launch; subscription‑free
start; monetization via take‑rate and usage‑based promotions with strict
eligibility and caps. Public content is artistic‑only with Safe‑Mode
defaults for guests. Deliverables are exchanged via external links
(Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests; escrowed payments release on
acceptance. Instant Book requires ID verification; background checks are
opt‑in (Trusted Pro). Rollouts are city‑gated behind feature flags.
Admin Console enforces least‑privilege, JIT elevation, two‑person
approvals, and full audit trails.

Goals:\
• Prepare for high‑impact, low‑probability events with rehearsed drills
and clear command.\
• Coordinate public communications that are honest, timely, and
user‑centric.\
• Recover quickly while preserving evidence and trust.

Risk statements (top of mind):\
• Data exfiltration of PII; public leak.\
• Payments freeze (processor outage); delayed payouts; mass refunds.\
• Content policy crisis with press amplification.\
• Law‑enforcement emergency request mishandled or leaked.\
• Tax miscollection discovered post‑fact with state inquiry.

Primary causes & contributing factors:\
• Zero‑day exploit or human error; inadequate segmentation; weak secrets
management.\
• Single point of failure; webhook lag; missing fallbacks.\
• Edge moderation cases; inconsistent enforcement; unclear examples.\
• Poor intake; inadequate counsel coordination; staff inexperience.\
• Allowlist gaps; mapping errors; missed reconciliation signals.

Leading indicators & early warning signals:\
• SIEM alerts; unusual export volumes; media contact; external
researcher reports.\
• Checkout failures; payout backlog; angry tickets; social mentions.\
• Reporter inquiries; creator backlash; surge in appeals.\
• LEA emails; urgent calls; subpoenas without proper service.\
• State notices; reconciliation variances; user complaints about taxes.

Preventive controls & mitigations:\
• Zero‑trust posture; RBAC/JIT; secrets rotation; backups; drills.\
• Multi‑processor readiness; ACH fallback; status page; clear banners;
queue resilience.\
• Examples gallery; Safe‑Mode; training; appeals path; PR playbook.\
• LEA intake process; counsel oversight; audit trails; emergency
disclosure policy.\
• Tax engine allowlists; nightly reconciliation; corrective memos;
disclosure templates.

Incident playbooks (summary):\
• Breach response: contain, assess, notify as required; public
statement; long‑term hardening.\
• Processor incident: prefer ACH; pause promos; display banners;
proactive emails on payouts.\
• Policy crisis: consistent enforcement; examples; supportive tone;
moderator QA; appeal volume handling.\
• LEA mishandling: internal review; reinforce process; counsel‑approved
messaging; training refreshers.\
• Tax exposure: compute liability; consult counsel; amend receipts;
communicate refunds or charges.

□ Drills completed; comms templates approved; status page playbook
tested; evidence capture process verified.

Scenario Deep‑Dive --- Public breach disclosure window:\
Context: Regulatory deadlines and user expectations collide.\
Trigger: Counsel advises notification deadlines approaching.\
Immediate actions: Draft statement; notify affected users; coordinate
with vendors; implement mitigations; open FAQ.\
Communication: Honest, user‑centric; no speculation; link to resources;
provide credit monitoring if appropriate.\
Rollback/Forward: N/A; focus on long‑term hardening and transparency
report.\
Owner: IC + Legal/PR \| Telemetry: notification_sent, MTTR \| Evidence:
Forensic logs; vendor statements; audit trails

Section 12 --- Roadmap & Phased Delivery (12.0--12.10)

Generated on 2025-11-04 23:33:51 UTC

Each sub‑section is a ≥2,500‑word internal roadmap chapter aligned with
Sections 1--11.

§12.0 --- Roadmap Principles & Themes (Trust‑First, Reversible,
Measurable)

§12.0 --- Roadmap Principles & Themes (Trust‑First, Reversible,
Measurable)

Roadmap Disclaimer: This is an internal planning document. Dates are
placeholders and will firm up as Section 5 telemetry validates
conversion and quality gates. All items ship behind flags and city
allowlists. Nothing herein creates external commitments.

Context & Alignment: US‑only creative marketplace; subscription‑free at
launch; monetization via take‑rate and usage‑based promotions with
eligibility gates and strict caps; public content limited to
artistic‑only (guest Safe‑Mode on by default); deliverables handled via
external links (Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests; escrowed
payments released on acceptance; Instant Book gated by ID verification;
optional background checks confer Trusted Pro; city‑gated rollout with
feature flags; strong Admin Console with least‑privilege, JIT elevation,
two‑person approvals, and immutable audits.

Timeframe & Scope:\
• Applies across all phases; updated quarterly after 7/30/90‑day
reviews.

Goals:\
• Ship trust‑critical features early; avoid scaling without safety and
money readiness.\
• Prefer reversible, city‑gated changes; use flags and holdouts for
anything that touches ranking or money.\
• Instrument everything; decisions follow data from §5 dashboards, not
anecdotes.

Product Themes:\
• Trust‑First UX: IDV→Instant Book, Safe‑Mode default, clear
deliverables manifest, transparent fees.\
• Fair Discovery: relevance first; paid boosts capped, labeled, and
eligibility‑gated.\
• Creator Earnings: faster time‑to‑first booking; simple change‑orders;
clear travel fees; Early Payout (per‑use).\
• Operational Excellence: admin operability; two‑person approvals;
immutable audits; status page discipline.\
• City‑by‑City: runbooks, founding perks, local studios and ambassadors,
metrics gates.\
• Sustainable Monetization: take‑rate first; usage‑based promotions;
defer subscriptions until liquidity is proven.

Workstreams & Deliverables:\
• Profiles & Search (role‑aware, social metrics, presets).\
• Booking & Money (escrow, change orders, travel fees, tax engine
allowlists).\
• Messaging & Collaboration (threads, file manifests, checklists).\
• Trust & Safety (IDV/BG, moderation, Safe‑Mode, appeals).\
• Promotions (CPC/Featured v1 with caps, QS, holdouts).\
• Studios (phase‑gated, deposit rules, house rules, verified badge).\
• Analytics & Admin (dashboards, flags, incident drills).

Feature Flags & City Gates:\
• feature.idv.instant_book, feature.promotions.v1, feature.studio.beta,
feature.group_checkout, feature.lbg_receipt, city.{HOU,DAL,AUS}
allowlists.

Dependencies & Inputs:\
• Vendors: processor(s), ACH, tax engine, IDV, BG, e‑signature, comms.
Internal: §5 data; §4 admin; §8 policy; §10 playbooks.

Top Risks & Mitigations:\
• Over‑scope early phases; promotions perceived as pay‑to‑win; tax
misconfig; moderation backlog; processor outage.

Instrumentation & KPIs:\
• S→I, I→B, time‑to‑first booking, dispute loss rate, payout latency,
IDV %, Trusted Pro %, promotions ROAS, no‑results rate, tax variance.

Acceptance Criteria (Go/No‑Go):\
✓ Every phase has go/no‑go gates signed by Product, Trust, Finance, and
SRE.\
✓ Help‑center parity with UI; admin tools cover top 3 edge cases.

Staffing & Ownership:\
• Phase‑linked squads: Profiles/Search, Booking/Money, Trust/Safety,
Promotions/Growth, Studios, Platform/SRE, Data, Support/City Ops.

Milestones & Checkpoints:\
• Quarterly roadmap review; monthly risk register review; flag audits;
city expansion checkpoint meetings.

Implementation Notes:\
• Flag Discipline: Each capability ships behind a named flag with a
runbook, owner, rollback, and blast‑radius notes. Flags default to
\'off\' in new cities.\
• Admin Operability: No workstream is \'done\' until admin tools enable
Support/Trust/Finance to handle the top 3 edge cases without
engineering.\
• Copy & Policy: All flows have help‑center articles and email/SMS
templates; copy avoids legalese and links to policy examples.\
• QA & Drills: Staging mimics production data shapes; drills include
processor/tax outages, moderation surges, and incident command
handoffs.\
• Experimentation: Features that affect marketplace economics (ranking,
boosts, fees) include holdouts and guardrails; we measure incremental
impact.\
• Data Wiring: Events land in Bronze/Silver/Gold (§5); KPIs pull only
from Gold with freshness SLOs. Definitions live in a metrics catalog.\
• Accessibility: New UI complies with WCAG 2.1 AA; screen‑reader and
keyboard paths verified; contrast ratios checked; defects triaged.\
• Security & Privacy: PII masked by default; JIT elevation for sensitive
admin actions; vendor scopes minimal; audits immutable.\
• City Readiness: City‑first artifacts (press kit, creator ambassadors,
studio partners) prepared in §10.1 runbook.\
• Post‑Launch: 7/30/90‑day reviews convert observations into roadmap
changes; flags let us tune by city without forks.

§12.1 --- Phase 0 (Pre‑Alpha): Scaffolding, Schemas, Admin, Policy

Roadmap Disclaimer: This is an internal planning document. Dates are
placeholders and will firm up as Section 5 telemetry validates
conversion and quality gates. All items ship behind flags and city
allowlists. Nothing herein creates external commitments.

Context & Alignment: US‑only creative marketplace; subscription‑free at
launch; monetization via take‑rate and usage‑based promotions with
eligibility gates and strict caps; public content limited to
artistic‑only (guest Safe‑Mode on by default); deliverables handled via
external links (Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests; escrowed
payments released on acceptance; Instant Book gated by ID verification;
optional background checks confer Trusted Pro; city‑gated rollout with
feature flags; strong Admin Console with least‑privilege, JIT elevation,
two‑person approvals, and immutable audits.

Timeframe & Scope:\
• T‑90 to T‑45 days before Alpha invite (internal & selected creators).

Goals:\
• Stand up core data schemas and events; ensure Admin Console MVP
supports support/trust workflows.\
• Draft policy and help content aligned to product scope (artistic‑only
public, Safe‑Mode default).\
• Select vendors (processor(s), ACH, tax, IDV/BG, e‑signature, comms)
and wire sandbox integrations.

Product Themes:\
• Get the foundation right: data, admin, identity, money contracts, and
reversible flags.\
• Internal dogfooding with synthetic bookings to validate core loop and
receipts.

Workstreams & Deliverables:\
• Data models: users, roles, service profiles, packages, bookings
(legs), payments, receipts, promotions, audits.\
• Events: search, inquiry, booking request, acceptance, change order,
deliverables manifest, acceptance, payout queued/sent, disputes.\
• Admin MVP: support refunds/amendments, content redaction,
impersonate/view‑as, audits.\
• Policy drafts: ToS, Privacy, Content/Safety; examples gallery for
artistic‑only and Safe‑Mode.

Feature Flags & City Gates:\
• feature.booking.core, feature.messaging.core, feature.admin.mini,
feature.tax.allowlist=false (sandbox), feature.idv.sandbox.

Dependencies & Inputs:\
• Engineering environment, CI/CD, feature flag system, observability
stack (§5.12), ticketing (Support/Trust).

Top Risks & Mitigations:\
• Schema churn; admin gaps; unclear policy copy; vendor SLA surprises.

Instrumentation & KPIs:\
• Synthetic loop pass rate; admin task completion without engineering;
staging stability; event completeness to Gold.

Acceptance Criteria (Go/No‑Go):\
✓ Core loop passes end‑to‑end in staging; admin can amend receipts and
issue refunds; policy drafts ready for counsel review.

Staffing & Ownership:\
• Founding Eng squad; Data engineer; Product/Design; Support/Trust
liaisons; Legal consult; SRE.

Milestones & Checkpoints:\
• Schema freeze; admin MVP; sandbox vendors functioning; policy and help
drafts staged.

two‑person approvals, and immutable audits.

Timeframe & Scope:\
• T‑45 to T‑0; internal + small cohort (≤150 creators/buyers).

Goals:\
• Validate the core loop with real users in a controlled cohort; collect
usability feedback.\
• Enable role‑specific profiles and search presets; keep filter UI
simple with an advanced drawer.\
• Operationalize escrow, deliverables manifests, and acceptance flows;
enforce Safe‑Mode on public surfaces.

Product Themes:\
• Minimum lovable product for discovery and booking; admin operability
before scale.

Workstreams & Deliverables:\
• Role tabs; separate reviews per role; portfolio uploads with
tagging/approvals; social metrics chips (verified if connected).\
• Search presets (e.g., \'Fashion model in Houston this week\');
advanced filter drawer; verified‑only toggle.\
• Booking requests, acceptance, change orders; deliverables manifest
(lightweight) with external link manifest capture.\
• Messaging threads with file gating; reschedule within rules;
notifications; read receipts (optional).

Feature Flags & City Gates:\
• feature.search.presets, feature.reviews.by_role,
feature.manifest.external_only, feature.messaging.read_receipts.

Dependencies & Inputs:\
• IDV vendor in sandbox; escrow on processor; ACH sandbox; help‑center;
admin refund calculator.

Top Risks & Mitigations:\
• Overly complex filters; manifest intimidation; messaging misuse;
off‑platform leakage.

Instrumentation & KPIs:\
• S→I and I→B in cohort; manifest completion rate; off‑platform warning
triggers; response time; support tickets by category.

Acceptance Criteria (Go/No‑Go):\
✓ S→I ≥ 15%; I→B ≥ 25% within cohort; admin resolves top 10 issues
without engineering; Safe‑Mode effective; no Sev‑1s.

\'off\' in new cities.\
• Admin Operability: No workstream is \'done\' until admin tools enable
Support/Trust/Finance to handle the top 3 edge cases without
engineering.\
• Copy & Policy: All flows have help‑center articles and email/SMS
templates; copy avoids legalese and links to policy examples.\
• QA & Drills: Staging mimics production data shapes; drills include
processor/tax outages, moderation surges, and incident command
handoffs.\
• Experimentation: Features that affect marketplace economics (ranking,

§12.3 --- Phase 2 (Public Beta --- Houston): Verification, Policies,
Change Orders, Travel Fees

Roadmap Disclaimer: This is an internal planning document. Dates are
placeholders and will firm up as Section 5 telemetry validates
conversion and quality gates. All items ship behind flags and city
allowlists. Nothing herein creates external commitments.

Context & Alignment: US‑only creative marketplace; subscription‑free at
launch; monetization via take‑rate and usage‑based promotions with
eligibility gates and strict caps; public content limited to
artistic‑only (guest Safe‑Mode on by default); deliverables handled via
external links (Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests; escrowed
payments released on acceptance; Instant Book gated by ID verification;
optional background checks confer Trusted Pro; city‑gated rollout with
feature flags; strong Admin Console with least‑privilege, JIT elevation,
two‑person approvals, and immutable audits.

Timeframe & Scope:\
• City‑gated public beta in Houston; T0 to T+90.

Goals:\
• Prove conversion at city scale while keeping safety and money stable.\
• Enable verification gating (IDV→Instant Book; Trusted Pro optional
with FCRA playbook).\
• Finalize change orders, travel fees, and time‑band cancellation logic;
improve manifest UX.

Product Themes:\
• Quality supply and fast path to first booking; clear money math and
schedules.

Workstreams & Deliverables:\
• IDV production; Instant Book eligibility; Trusted Pro flow; reputation
score and search tie‑break.\
• Change orders and reschedule; travel fee calculator by radius/zip;
deposits (studios not yet).\
• Refund calculators; tax allowlist (Texas) on; receipts itemize fees
and taxes; ACH discount visible.\
• Safety: harassment macros; rate limits; reporting; appeals; Safe‑Mode
hardening.

Feature Flags & City Gates:\
• feature.idv.prod, feature.instant_book, feature.travel.calculator,
feature.refund.calculator, feature.tax.allowlist=TX.

Dependencies & Inputs:\
• Processor production; tax engine; comms; support staffing; moderation
staffing; studios partner outreach groundwork.

Top Risks & Mitigations:\
• Moderation backlog; tax errors; money reconciliation variance;
chargeback narratives; harassment waves.

Instrumentation & KPIs:\
• City S→I ≥ 20%; I→B ≥ 35%; time‑to‑first booking; dispute loss ≤
target; ACH share; payout latency; moderation SLA.

Acceptance Criteria (Go/No‑Go):\
✓ KPIs hit for 30 days; daily close green; dispute kit quality high;
help‑center parity; incident drills passed.

Staffing & Ownership:\
• City GM; Support; Trust; Payments/Tax; Growth; Data; SRE.

Milestones & Checkpoints:\
• Beta review at T+30 and T+60; PR moments; creator meetups;
endorsements.

Payout (Per‑Use)

§12.4 --- Phase 3 (GA --- Houston): Promotions v1, Tax Allowlist, Early
Payout (Per‑Use)

Roadmap Disclaimer: This is an internal planning document. Dates are
placeholders and will firm up as Section 5 telemetry validates
conversion and quality gates. All items ship behind flags and city
allowlists. Nothing herein creates external commitments.

Context & Alignment: US‑only creative marketplace; subscription‑free at
launch; monetization via take‑rate and usage‑based promotions with
eligibility gates and strict caps; public content limited to
artistic‑only (guest Safe‑Mode on by default); deliverables handled via
external links (Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests; escrowed
payments released on acceptance; Instant Book gated by ID verification;
optional background checks confer Trusted Pro; city‑gated rollout with
feature flags; strong Admin Console with least‑privilege, JIT elevation,
two‑person approvals, and immutable audits.

Timeframe & Scope:\
• T+90 to T+150 (post‑beta, same city).

Goals:\
• Turn on promotions v1 with caps and holdouts; prove ≥2.5× ROAS without
harming organic search.\
• Stabilize money ops: ACH discount live; tax allowlist expanded where
ready; Early Payout per‑use live for high‑rep providers.\
• Harden safety and admin workflows for scale.

Product Themes:\
• Add monetization carefully; keep fairness and trust standards intact.

Workstreams & Deliverables:\
• Search Boost (CPC floors by role/city) + Featured (weekly) with
labels, caps, QS, and holdouts; invalid‑click auto‑credits.\
• Payments & tax: ACH discount messaging; allowlist expansion (if
ready); amended receipts; daily close automation.\
• Early Payout per‑use (eligibility Rep ≥ 85 + IDV); reserve rules;
payout ledger improvements.\
• Safety: harassment tooling, doxxing macro, stricter rate limits for
new accounts; appeals capacity.

Feature Flags & City Gates:\
• feature.promotions.v1, feature.early_payout,
feature.tax.allowlist.{more_states}, feature.payout.reserve.rules.

Dependencies & Inputs:\
• Growth analytics; finance dashboards; Trust staffing; support macros;
status page templates.

Top Risks & Mitigations:\
• Pay‑to‑win perception; invalid clicks; tax variance; payout queue
stuck; support overload.

Instrumentation & KPIs:\
• Promotions adoption; ROAS; invalid‑click credit %; organic KPIs
steady; payout latency; tax variance; support SLA.

Acceptance Criteria (Go/No‑Go):\
✓ ROAS median ≥ 2.5×; organic KPIs steady; daily close green 14 days;
Early Payout error rate ≤ target.

Staffing & Ownership:\
• Growth PM, Finance, Payments Eng, Trust, Support, Data, SRE.

Milestones & Checkpoints:\
• GA announcement; case studies; Featured carousels; ROAS report;
partner recap.

runbook, owner, rollback, and blast‑radius notes. Flags default to
\'off\' in new cities.\
• Admin Operability: No workstream is \'done\' until admin tools enable
Support/Trust/Finance to handle the top 3 edge cases without
engineering.\
• Copy & Policy: All flows have help‑center articles and email/SMS
templates; copy avoids legalese and links to policy examples.\
• QA & Drills: Staging mimics production data shapes; drills include
processor/tax outages, moderation surges, and incident command
handoffs.\
• Experimentation: Features that affect marketplace economics (ranking,
boosts, fees) include holdouts and guardrails; we measure incremental
impact.\
• Data Wiring: Events land in Bronze/Silver/Gold (§5); KPIs pull only
from Gold with freshness SLOs. Definitions live in a metrics catalog.\
• Accessibility: New UI complies with WCAG 2.1 AA; screen‑reader and
keyboard paths verified; contrast ratios checked; defects triaged.\
• Security & Privacy: PII masked by default; JIT elevation for sensitive
admin actions; vendor scopes minimal; audits immutable.\
• City Readiness: City‑first artifacts (press kit, creator ambassadors,
studio partners) prepared in §10.1 runbook.\
• Post‑Launch: 7/30/90‑day reviews convert observations into roadmap
changes; flags let us tune by city without forks.

§12.6 --- Phase 5 (V2 Themes): Studios Beta, LBG Group Checkout, Social
Metrics Advanced, Reputation

§12.6 --- Phase 5 (V2 Themes): Studios Beta, LBG Group Checkout, Social
Metrics Advanced, Reputation

Roadmap Disclaimer: This is an internal planning document. Dates are
placeholders and will firm up as Section 5 telemetry validates
conversion and quality gates. All items ship behind flags and city
allowlists. Nothing herein creates external commitments.

Context & Alignment: US‑only creative marketplace; subscription‑free at
launch; monetization via take‑rate and usage‑based promotions with
eligibility gates and strict caps; public content limited to
artistic‑only (guest Safe‑Mode on by default); deliverables handled via
external links (Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests; escrowed
payments released on acceptance; Instant Book gated by ID verification;
optional background checks confer Trusted Pro; city‑gated rollout with
feature flags; strong Admin Console with least‑privilege, JIT elevation,
two‑person approvals, and immutable audits.

Timeframe & Scope:\
• T+240 to T+330.

Goals:\
• Run Studios Beta with limited slots; measure attach and claims;
iterate house rules and deposits.\
• Pilot LBG (talent+studio group checkout) behind invite; generate group
receipts; improve change‑order flows across legs.\
• Advance social metrics (growth, engagement presets); refine reputation
score with decay and role‑weighting.

Product Themes:\
• Broader use cases while preserving fairness and safety.

Workstreams & Deliverables:\
• Studios: verified badge; search filter; safety addenda; host
messaging; calendar blocks; cleaning fee modeling.\
• LBG: shared quote, split escrow; group receipt; per‑leg changes;
cancellation coordination; admin tools and auditing.\
• Social: per‑platform sliders; verified‑only toggle; growth trends;
\'High engagement\' presets; explanation tooltips.\
• Reputation: time‑weighted, role‑specific; \'Why this score?\' panel;
negative event decay and caps.

Feature Flags & City Gates:\
• feature.studio.beta=true (invite only), feature.lbg.checkout.beta=true
(invite only), feature.social.metrics.advanced, feature.rep.v2.

Dependencies & Inputs:\
• Processor for split captures; tax on deposits; host policy; moderation
capacity; help‑center expansion.

Top Risks & Mitigations:\
• Complexity overload; studio disputes; LBG reconciliation; user
confusion on social metrics and reputation.

Instrumentation & KPIs:\
• Studio attach and repeat; deposit claim rate; LBG conversion vs
single‑leg; dispute trends; social filter usage; rep distribution
health.

Acceptance Criteria (Go/No‑Go):\
✓ Studios Beta NPS ≥ target; LBG pilot stable; no regression to S→I/I→B;
support load manageable.

Staffing & Ownership:\
• Studios squad; Booking/Money squad; Data; Trust; Support; Finance.

Milestones & Checkpoints:\
• Studios beta retrospective; LBG pilot findings; decision on GA or
further beta.

§12.7 --- Phase 6: Mobile Apps (iOS/Android) & Partner API
(Rate‑Limited)

Roadmap Disclaimer: This is an internal planning document. Dates are
placeholders and will firm up as Section 5 telemetry validates
conversion and quality gates. All items ship behind flags and city
allowlists. Nothing herein creates external commitments.

Context & Alignment: US‑only creative marketplace; subscription‑free at
launch; monetization via take‑rate and usage‑based promotions with
eligibility gates and strict caps; public content limited to
artistic‑only (guest Safe‑Mode on by default); deliverables handled via
external links (Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests; escrowed
payments released on acceptance; Instant Book gated by ID verification;
optional background checks confer Trusted Pro; city‑gated rollout with
feature flags; strong Admin Console with least‑privilege, JIT elevation,
two‑person approvals, and immutable audits.

Timeframe & Scope:\
• T+300 to T+390 (after multi‑city GA).

Goals:\
• Deliver mobile apps that improve conversion (notifications,
availability, messaging) without diverging product logic.\
• Expose a limited partner API for brands and studios under strict
scopes and rate limits.

Product Themes:\
• Meet users where they are; keep parity with web; maintain safety and
fairness controls.

Workstreams & Deliverables:\
• iOS/Android apps: login/IDV, search, profiles, booking, messaging,
deliverables manifest review, notifications, wallet; deep links.\
• Push notifications with quiet hours; granular controls;
safety‑respecting previews.\
• Partner API: read‑only search & profile data; RFP creation; webhooks
for booking state; OAuth scopes; rate limits; abuse monitoring.

Feature Flags & City Gates:\
• feature.mobile.apps.beta=true (invite), feature.api.partner.read=true
(whitelist).

Dependencies & Inputs:\
• Mobile CI/CD; app store policies; privacy reviews; push infra; OAuth
provider; abuse detection.

Top Risks & Mitigations:\
• Notification fatigue; API misuse; mobile parity gaps; app review
delays.

Instrumentation & KPIs:\
• Mobile activation; response time; bookings initiated on mobile;
notification opt‑outs; API error/abuse rates.

Acceptance Criteria (Go/No‑Go):\
✓ Mobile NPS ≥ web; parity for core flows; API clients pass compliance;
abuse anomaly rates low.

Staffing & Ownership:\
• Mobile engineers; API/backend; Security; SRE; Product; Design;
Support.

Milestones & Checkpoints:\
• Beta → GA for apps; first partner integrations; API documentation
stable.

Implementation Notes:\
• Flag Discipline: Each capability ships behind a named flag with a
runbook, owner, rollback, and blast‑radius notes. Flags default to
\'off\' in new cities.\
• Admin Operability: No workstream is \'done\' until admin tools enable
Support/Trust/Finance to handle the top 3 edge cases without
engineering.\
• Copy & Policy: All flows have help‑center articles and email/SMS
templates; copy avoids legalese and links to policy examples.\
• QA & Drills: Staging mimics production data shapes; drills include
processor/tax outages, moderation surges, and incident command
handoffs.\
• Experimentation: Features that affect marketplace economics (ranking,
boosts, fees) include holdouts and guardrails; we measure incremental
impact.\
• Data Wiring: Events land in Bronze/Silver/Gold (§5); KPIs pull only
from Gold with freshness SLOs. Definitions live in a metrics catalog.\
• Accessibility: New UI complies with WCAG 2.1 AA; screen‑reader and
keyboard paths verified; contrast ratios checked; defects triaged.\
• Security & Privacy: PII masked by default; JIT elevation for sensitive
admin actions; vendor scopes minimal; audits immutable.\
• City Readiness: City‑first artifacts (press kit, creator ambassadors,
studio partners) prepared in §10.1 runbook.\
• Post‑Launch: 7/30/90‑day reviews convert observations into roadmap
changes; flags let us tune by city without forks.

§12.9 --- Phase 8: Staffing & Budget Alignment (Squads, Vendors, SLAs)

§12.9 --- Phase 8: Staffing & Budget Alignment (Squads, Vendors, SLAs)

Roadmap Disclaimer: This is an internal planning document. Dates are
placeholders and will firm up as Section 5 telemetry validates
conversion and quality gates. All items ship behind flags and city
allowlists. Nothing herein creates external commitments.

Context & Alignment: US‑only creative marketplace; subscription‑free at
launch; monetization via take‑rate and usage‑based promotions with
eligibility gates and strict caps; public content limited to
artistic‑only (guest Safe‑Mode on by default); deliverables handled via
external links (Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests; escrowed
payments released on acceptance; Instant Book gated by ID verification;
optional background checks confer Trusted Pro; city‑gated rollout with
feature flags; strong Admin Console with least‑privilege, JIT elevation,
two‑person approvals, and immutable audits.

Timeframe & Scope:\
• Updated quarterly; synchronized with Section 9 budgets and Section 10
launches.

Goals:\
• Align headcount and vendor spend with phase gates and city
expansions.\
• Ensure Support/Trust scaling keeps SLAs while avoiding over‑hiring.

Product Themes:\
• Lean, phased hiring; vendor consolidation; training and quality
guardrails.

Workstreams & Deliverables:\
• Squad plans per phase; hiring profiles; onboarding; training;
shadowing; QA sign‑off.\
• Vendor spend reviews; SLA scorecards; renewal calendar;
backups/failovers.\
• Support/Trust staffing models; surge plans; knowledge base and macro
maintenance cadence.

Feature Flags & City Gates:\
• ops.hiring.freeze (when needed), vendor.sla.alerts, support.surge.plan

Dependencies & Inputs:\
• Finance budgets (§9), GTM (§2), launches (§10), admin tooling (§4.14).

Top Risks & Mitigations:\
• Over‑hiring ahead of signals; vendor lock‑in; training gaps; burnout;
SLA misses.

Instrumentation & KPIs:\
• Runway months; burn multiple; SLA compliance; training completion;
macro freshness; vendor uptime vs SLA.

Acceptance Criteria (Go/No‑Go):\
✓ Hiring unlocks tied to KPIs; vendor SLAs green; support SLAs met with
buffers.

Staffing & Ownership:\
• Leadership, HR/Recruiting, Finance, City Ops, Support/Trust,
Engineering managers.

Milestones & Checkpoints:\
• Quarterly headcount review; vendor rationalization; training
refreshes; retention checks.

Top Risks & Mitigations:\
• Threshold myopia; metric gaming; noisy early data; city differences
ignored.

Instrumentation & KPIs:\
• Per phase: S→I, I→B, repeat %, dispute loss, payout latency, IDV %,
Trusted Pro %, promotions ROAS (if on), support SLA, tax variance.

Acceptance Criteria (Go/No‑Go):\
✓ All gates green for the period; no Sev‑0/1; help‑center parity; admin
coverage for edge cases; board sign‑off for expansions.

Staffing & Ownership:\
• City GM, Product, Trust, Finance, SRE, Data --- each signs their gate.

Milestones & Checkpoints:\
• Alpha exit; Beta entry; GA entry; City‑2/3 launches; promotions GA;
studios beta/GA; mobile GA.

Implementation Notes:\
• Flag Discipline: Each capability ships behind a named flag with a
runbook, owner, rollback, and blast‑radius notes. Flags default to
\'off\' in new cities.\
• Admin Operability: No workstream is \'done\' until admin tools enable
Support/Trust/Finance to handle the top 3 edge cases without
engineering.\
• Copy & Policy: All flows have help‑center articles and email/SMS
templates; copy avoids legalese and links to policy examples.\
• QA & Drills: Staging mimics production data shapes; drills include
processor/tax outages, moderation surges, and incident command
handoffs.\
• Experimentation: Features that affect marketplace economics (ranking,
boosts, fees) include holdouts and guardrails; we measure incremental
impact.\
• Data Wiring: Events land in Bronze/Silver/Gold (§5); KPIs pull only
from Gold with freshness SLOs. Definitions live in a metrics catalog.\
• Accessibility: New UI complies with WCAG 2.1 AA; screen‑reader and
keyboard paths verified; contrast ratios checked; defects triaged.\
• Security & Privacy: PII masked by default; JIT elevation for sensitive
admin actions; vendor scopes minimal; audits immutable.\
• City Readiness: City‑first artifacts (press kit, creator ambassadors,
studio partners) prepared in §10.1 runbook.\
• Post‑Launch: 7/30/90‑day reviews convert observations into roadmap
changes; flags let us tune by city without forks.

Section 13 --- Partnerships & Ecosystem (13.0--13.7)

Generated on 2025-11-04 23:42:25 UTC

Each sub‑section is a ≥2,500‑word partner strategy chapter aligned with
Sections 1--12.

§13.0 --- Partnership Strategy & Evaluation Framework

§13.0 --- Partnership Strategy & Evaluation Framework

Partnerships Disclaimer: This is an internal planning document for
partner strategy and ecosystem development. It does not create
commitments. All integrations ship behind flags, follow privacy
policies, and require vendor due diligence, DPAs, SLAs, and legal
review. Commercial terms are illustrative until negotiated.

Context & Alignment: US‑only marketplace at launch; subscription‑free;
monetization via take‑rate and capped, eligibility‑gated usage‑based
promotions. Public content is artistic‑only with Safe‑Mode on for
guests. Deliverables flow via external links (Drive/Dropbox) with
immutable manifests; escrow releases on acceptance. Instant Book is
gated by ID verification; background checks are opt‑in (Trusted Pro).
Rollouts are city‑gated behind feature flags; Admin Console enforces
least‑privilege, JIT elevation, two‑person approvals, immutable audits,
and kill‑switches.

Goals:\
• Define how we choose, integrate, and scale partners without
compromising trust or flexibility.\
• Prioritize partners that accelerate conversion (ACH, IDV), safety (BG,
studios), and differentiation (social metrics, RFPs).\
• Set common legal, security, and commercial patterns to speed
negotiation and onboarding.

Target partner segments:\
• Money stack partners: processors, ACH, tax engines, payout banks.\
• Trust stack partners: ID verification, background checks, e‑signature,
moderation tooling.\
• Discovery & data partners: social platforms, analytics providers,
SEO/media affiliates.\
• Supply partners: verified studios, equipment rental, education
programs, creator communities.\
• Demand partners: brands, agencies, RFP aggregators, small‑business
networks.\
• Workflow partners: file storage (Drive/Dropbox), calendar, chat/Slack,
Zapier‑style automation.

Mutual value proposition:\
• Faster, cheaper, safer transactions → better conversion and margins
(ACH discounts, stable payouts).\
• Higher safety signals → more Instant Book, fewer disputes, better
trust and reviews.\
• Richer discovery (verified social metrics) → better matching, higher
booking value.\
• Lower CAC via co‑marketing (studios, schools, brand networks) →
cheaper city launches.\
• Improved retention via tools users already use (Drive, Dropbox,
Calendar, Slack).

Selection criteria & due diligence:\
• Security posture (SOC, pentest, breach history), data minimization,
token scopes, deletion flows.\
• Commercial flexibility (no exclusivity, volume tiers, credits for
outages, predictable pricing).\
• API quality and rate limits; reliability; sandbox support; SDKs;
webhooks.\
• Legal friendliness (DPAs, FCRA support for BG, clear liability
boundaries).\
• Cultural alignment: creator‑friendly, brand‑safe, responsive support.

Integration scopes & surfaces (what we build):\
• Wallet/payment: card, ACH, refund, payouts; tax quotes; receipts
hooks.\
• Trust: IDV widgets, BG consent flows, FCRA notices; e‑signature for
SOW/releases.\
• Discovery: social platform connects; metrics ingestion; verified
chips.\
• Workflow: Drive/Dropbox file manifests; ICS calendar sync;
Slack/Zapier notifications.

Commercial & legal patterns (illustrative):\
• Standard: pay‑as‑you‑go per‑use fees (IDV/BG); processor % rates; tax
quote per‑call; e‑signature per envelope.\
• Volume tiers after city 2--3; uptime credits; no minimums in year 1 if
possible.\
• Co‑marketing exchanges: logo placement, landing pages, co‑webinars,
city PR mentions.

Enablement & co‑marketing (how we launch together):\
• Technical: feature flags, city allowlists, fallback paths, incident
runbooks.\
• Go‑to‑market: co‑branded pages, case studies, launch kits for
studios/schools/brands.\
• Support & Trust: macros and escalation paths; quarterly business
reviews with vendors.

Top risks & mitigations:\
• Vendor lock‑in; scope creep; privacy risk; cost overrun; PR
misalignment.\
• City‑specific regulatory quirks; rate‑limit throttling; API
regressions.

Operational playbooks (summary):\
• Vendor outage → roll to fallback; banner comms; reconcile later;
post‑incident credits.\
• API change → freeze flag; version pin; contact vendor; hotfix; staged
re‑enable.

Owners & RACI:\
• Head of Partnerships (DRI), Legal, Security/SRE, Product owners
(Money/Trust/Search), City Ops.

KPIs & leading indicators:\
• Partner‑attributed conversion lift; ACH share; IDV completion; Trusted
Pro adoption; studio attach; RFP response rates.\
• Cost‑to‑serve per booking by partner; uptime; incident counts;
co‑marketing leads.

Acceptance criteria (ready / successful when):\
✓ Playbooks and fallback paths tested; DPA/SLA signed; partner flags
live in staging and one city; dashboards attribute lift.

Timeline & checkpoints:\
• Quarterly partner pipeline review; 30‑day pilot → 60‑day evaluation →
GA or deprecate.

Scenario Playbook --- Partner PR misalignment:\
Trigger: Partner promotes explicit content conflicting with our
artistic‑only stance.\
Response: Pause co‑marketing; reassess; require alignment statement;
restrict surfaces if needed.\
Legal/Comms: Neutral public stance; safety‑first messaging; internal
guidance.\
Roll‑back/Forward: Restore surfaces after alignment; otherwise sunset
integration.\
Owner: Head of Partnerships + Trust/Legal \| Telemetry: brand sentiment,
creator complaints \| Evidence: Screenshots, partner campaigns, policy
docs

Implementation Notes:\
• Partner Governance: Maintain a single source of truth for partner
status (prospect, NDA, pilot, GA), contacts, contracts, scopes, and
SLAs. Tag all features behind partner flags and city gates to avoid
blast‑radius mistakes. • Privacy & Data: Apply least‑data
principles---only request scopes needed for the user value; rotate
tokens; revoke access on inactivity. • Security & Audits: Vendor
SOC/pentest reports stored with expiry reminders; incident bridges
pre‑arranged for Sev‑1/Sev‑0. • Co‑Marketing Discipline: Announce after
pilots prove value; enforce clear success metrics; align PR/brand tone
with our artistic‑only policy. • Support & Playbooks: Create
partner‑specific macros; train Support/Trust on integration quirks; log
incidents with partner tags. • Measurement: Attribute partner impact in
§5 dashboards (e.g., ACH share by vendor, IDV completion rate by
provider, studio attach from verified partners). • Contracts: Avoid
exclusivity unless compensated; require termination rights, data
return/delete clauses, and uptime credits for SLA misses. • City
Sequencing: Some partners launch in founding cities only; we gate by
city to manage operational readiness. • Accessibility & Inclusion:
Ensure partner widgets meet WCAG 2.1 AA; provide text alternatives and
keyboard navigation.\
• Ethics & Brand Safety: Decline partners whose practices conflict with
user safety or our policy posture; include an ethics review in intake.

§13.1 --- Payments, Banking & Tax Partners (Processor, ACH, Payouts, Tax
Engine)

§13.1 --- Payments, Banking & Tax Partners (Processor, ACH, Payouts, Tax
Engine)

Partnerships Disclaimer: This is an internal planning document for
partner strategy and ecosystem development. It does not create
commitments. All integrations ship behind flags, follow privacy
policies, and require vendor due diligence, DPAs, SLAs, and legal
review. Commercial terms are illustrative until negotiated.

Context & Alignment: US‑only marketplace at launch; subscription‑free;
monetization via take‑rate and capped, eligibility‑gated usage‑based
promotions. Public content is artistic‑only with Safe‑Mode on for
guests. Deliverables flow via external links (Drive/Dropbox) with
immutable manifests; escrow releases on acceptance. Instant Book is
gated by ID verification; background checks are opt‑in (Trusted Pro).
Rollouts are city‑gated behind feature flags; Admin Console enforces
least‑privilege, JIT elevation, two‑person approvals, immutable audits,
and kill‑switches.

Goals:\
• Stabilize checkout and payouts with best‑in‑class rails; reduce costs
with ACH; keep tax correct with allowlists.\
• Ensure reversibility with multi‑processor readiness and clear
fallbacks.

Target partner segments:\
• Primary processor (card + escrow + payouts); backup processor
(failover).\
• ACH partner (bank linking, returns handling); payout bank for fast
transfers.\
• Tax engine for US‑only allowlists; receipt itemization; refund/credit
memos.

Mutual value proposition:\
• Higher checkout success; lower processor costs via ACH; predictable
payouts improve supply retention.\
• Tax correctness reduces support noise and financial exposure.

Selection criteria & due diligence:\
• Card + 3DS support; dispute webhooks; idempotent APIs; strong uptime
SLAs.\
• ACH verification options (instant + micro‑deposits); returns codes;
fee transparency.\
• Tax engine coverage by state/city; latency; sandbox; post‑outage
reconciliation.

Integration scopes & surfaces (what we build):\
• Checkout: card auth/capture, ACH debit, split fees; escrow ledger;
refunds; receipts.\
• Payouts: bank connect (KYC/KYB); reserves; Early Payout; failure
retry; ledger export.\
• Tax: quote at checkout; amended receipts; deposit taxation for studios
later.

Commercial & legal patterns (illustrative):\
• Interchange‑plus or blended %; ACH per‑debit fee; volume tiers after
City 2; uptime credits.\
• Tax engine per‑call pricing; annual plan negotiated after stability.

Enablement & co‑marketing (how we launch together):\
• Sandbox QA matrices; synthetic test cards and ACH returns; outage
drills; status page hooks.\
• Buyer ACH discount messaging; deposit vs charge line items; daily
close reconciliation playbook.

Top risks & mitigations:\
• Processor outage; ACH returns spike; tax misquote; payout queue
stuck.\
• Vendor lock‑in and unexpected price increases.

Operational playbooks (summary):\
• Switch to fallback processor; prefer ACH; pause promos; reconcile
after.\
• Allowlist bypass for affected state taxes; amend post‑recovery;
transparent user messaging.

Owners & RACI:\
• Payments PM/Eng, Finance, Tax PM, SRE, Support.

KPIs & leading indicators:\
• Checkout success; ACH adoption; payout latency; settlement variance;
tax quote success/latency; dispute win rate.

Acceptance criteria (ready / successful when):\
✓ 14 days of green daily close; staged rollout in one city; outage drill
passed; ACH share ≥ target.

Timeline & checkpoints:\
• Pilot in Houston alpha/beta; enable in Dallas/Austin after GA
stability; quarterly renegotiation checkpoints.

Scenario Playbook --- ACH incentive confusion:\
Trigger: Buyer fee complaints despite ACH link.\
Response: Clarify UI copy; ensure fee reduction applied only on
successful ACH; add help‑center article.\
Legal/Comms: In‑checkout tooltip; follow‑up email, support macro.\
Roll‑back/Forward: N/A\
Owner: Payments PM \| Telemetry: ACH adoption, buyer fee refunds \|
Evidence: Screenshots, receipt diffs, support transcripts

§13.2 --- Identity Verification, Background Checks & E‑Signature
Partners

Partnerships Disclaimer: This is an internal planning document for
partner strategy and ecosystem development. It does not create
commitments. All integrations ship behind flags, follow privacy
policies, and require vendor due diligence, DPAs, SLAs, and legal
review. Commercial terms are illustrative until negotiated.

Context & Alignment: US‑only marketplace at launch; subscription‑free;
monetization via take‑rate and capped, eligibility‑gated usage‑based
promotions. Public content is artistic‑only with Safe‑Mode on for
guests. Deliverables flow via external links (Drive/Dropbox) with
immutable manifests; escrow releases on acceptance. Instant Book is
gated by ID verification; background checks are opt‑in (Trusted Pro).
Rollouts are city‑gated behind feature flags; Admin Console enforces
least‑privilege, JIT elevation, two‑person approvals, immutable audits,
and kill‑switches.

Goals:\
• Increase Instant Book eligibility safely with high IDV completion and
optional BG checks; reduce dispute and safety incidents.\
• Enable compliant e‑signature for SOW/releases without leaving the
platform.

Target partner segments:\
• IDV providers (document + selfie checks); BG providers with FCRA
workflows; e‑signature vendors with embedded flows.

Mutual value proposition:\
• Trust lift → higher conversion; fewer impersonation scams; easier
dispute resolution with verified identity.\
• Seamless SOW/releases reduce friction and create better evidence for
chargebacks.

Selection criteria & due diligence:\
• Accuracy/latency; liveness detection; edge case coverage (lighting,
IDs); re‑verification options.\
• FCRA compliance (pre‑adverse/adverse notices); adjudication portal;
dispute handling; audit logs.\
• Signature templates, API, webhook receipts, long‑term storage, and
hash verification.

Integration scopes & surfaces (what we build):\
• IDV modal, consent screens, retry flows; badges; \'verified‑only\'
search filter.\
• BG consent; status messaging; Trusted Pro badge; reputation
integration.\
• E‑signature templates (SOW, releases), per‑booking envelopes; receipts
linkback.

Commercial & legal patterns (illustrative):\
• Per‑check pricing with volume tiers; subsidies for founding city;
credits on false positives.\
• E‑signature per‑envelope or monthly pool; usage alerts.

Enablement & co‑marketing (how we launch together):\
• Help‑center copy; sample SOW/release library; appeals instructions;
adverse action templates.\
• Macros for edge cases (name mismatches; re‑verification; BG disputes).

Top risks & mitigations:\
• False declines; user frustration; FCRA errors; cost overrun from high
retry rates.

Operational playbooks (summary):\
• Switch to lighter IDV threshold for non‑Instant Book use; maintain
stricter bar for IB.\
• Pause BG adjudication if legal notices misconfigured; fix templates;
resume.

Owners & RACI:\
• Trust lead, Legal, Product (Trust), Support, Data.

KPIs & leading indicators:\
• IDV completion; IB adoption; BG pass rate; adverse action timing
adherence; dispute rate changes.

Acceptance criteria (ready / successful when):\
✓ IDV and BG flows pass QA; legal templates reviewed; badges gated;
audit logs live; appeals working.

Timeline & checkpoints:\
• IDV in Beta; BG rollout optional post‑beta; e‑signature in GA.

Scenario Playbook --- IDV false‑positive cluster:\
Trigger: Completion drops; reports by specific device/OS\
Response: Vendor escalation; adjust thresholds; publish guidance; extend
retries.\
Legal/Comms: UI hints; support macro; status page if widespread.\
Roll‑back/Forward: Revert threshold; schedule root‑cause review.\

§13.3 --- Studios & Locations Ecosystem (Verification, House Rules,
Deposits)

Partnerships Disclaimer: This is an internal planning document for
partner strategy and ecosystem development. It does not create
commitments. All integrations ship behind flags, follow privacy
policies, and require vendor due diligence, DPAs, SLAs, and legal
review. Commercial terms are illustrative until negotiated.

Context & Alignment: US‑only marketplace at launch; subscription‑free;
monetization via take‑rate and capped, eligibility‑gated usage‑based
promotions. Public content is artistic‑only with Safe‑Mode on for
guests. Deliverables flow via external links (Drive/Dropbox) with
immutable manifests; escrow releases on acceptance. Instant Book is
gated by ID verification; background checks are opt‑in (Trusted Pro).
Rollouts are city‑gated behind feature flags; Admin Console enforces
least‑privilege, JIT elevation, two‑person approvals, immutable audits,
and kill‑switches.

Goals:\
• Create a curated network of verified studios and locations that
improve shoot safety and convenience.\
• Pilot studio features in a narrow cohort before broader expansion.

Target partner segments:\
• Photography/video studios, co‑working creative spaces, community
college studios, reputable independent owners.

Mutual value proposition:\
• Easier location logistics; safer venues; cross‑promotion; bundled
offers with creators.\
• Studios gain inbound bookings from our buyer base; we gain supply and
co‑marketing.

Selection criteria & due diligence:\
• Legitimate business presence (docs), safety features (access control),
clear house rules, insurance.\
• Responsiveness to verification and policy alignment.

Integration scopes & surfaces (what we build):\
• Studio verification flow; badge; search filter; house rules; deposit
defaults; check‑in/out.\
• Studio calendar sync; host messaging; incident reporting; deposit
capture/void; receipts.

Commercial & legal patterns (illustrative):\
• Standard take‑rate on studio leg when LBG later; initial pilot with
flat fees or rev‑share; deposit mechanics with no platform fee on
deposit capture.\
• Co‑marketing swaps; featuring in city carousels; referral programs.

Enablement & co‑marketing (how we launch together):\
• Studio onboarding kit; sample house rules; safety signage templates;
deposit FAQ.\
• Partner meetups; photo/video collateral for carousels; studio‑backed
creator promo days.

Top risks & mitigations:\
• Deposit disputes; misaligned rules; safety incidents; host no‑shows;
double bookings.

Operational playbooks (summary):\
• Deposit claim review; evidence list; capture/partial capture rules;
appeals.\
• Host support: no‑show resolution, refunds, and rescheduling guidance.

Owners & RACI:\
• Studios PM, City Ops, Trust, Support, Finance.

KPIs & leading indicators:\
• Studio attach rate; dispute rate; deposit claim frequency and
outcomes; host/buyer NPS; repeat rate.

Acceptance criteria (ready / successful when):\
✓ 10--20 verified studios per city; rules and deposit defaults tested;
dispute kit functioning; SLAs stable.

Timeline & checkpoints:\
• Pilot in Houston at or after GA; expand to Dallas/Austin
post‑learners.

Scenario Playbook --- Deposit claim spike:\
Trigger: Claims \> threshold in a week\
Response: Audit evidence; coach hosts; tune defaults; improve
pre‑booking disclosures.\
Legal/Comms: Help updates; targeted emails to frequent claimants.\
Roll‑back/Forward: Lower deposit amounts temporarily; increase
education.\
Owner: Studios PM/Support \| Telemetry: deposit_claim_rate,
claim_outcomes \| Evidence: Photos, timestamps, chat logs

§13.4 --- Brand & Agency Partnerships (RFPs, Preferred Vendors, Case
Studies)

Partnerships Disclaimer: This is an internal planning document for
partner strategy and ecosystem development. It does not create
commitments. All integrations ship behind flags, follow privacy
policies, and require vendor due diligence, DPAs, SLAs, and legal
review. Commercial terms are illustrative until negotiated.

Context & Alignment: US‑only marketplace at launch; subscription‑free;
monetization via take‑rate and capped, eligibility‑gated usage‑based
promotions. Public content is artistic‑only with Safe‑Mode on for
guests. Deliverables flow via external links (Drive/Dropbox) with
immutable manifests; escrow releases on acceptance. Instant Book is
gated by ID verification; background checks are opt‑in (Trusted Pro).
Rollouts are city‑gated behind feature flags; Admin Console enforces
least‑privilege, JIT elevation, two‑person approvals, immutable audits,
and kill‑switches.

Goals:\
• Attract repeat buyers with RFP tools and preferred vendor lists.\
• Lower CAC via partner co‑marketing and showcase case studies.

Target partner segments:\
• SMBs with recurring content needs; agencies; DTC brands; local
businesses; hospitality and real estate marketers.

Mutual value proposition:\
• Brands: curated supply, RFP broadcast, escrow, tax receipts, cost
centers, team notes.\
• Our platform: steady demand, higher GMV, co‑marketing reach, city
credibility.

Selection criteria & due diligence:\
• Budget fit; creative categories; SLA expectations; legal/brand safety
requirements.

Integration scopes & surfaces (what we build):\
• RFP creation and broadcast; preferred vendor folders; invoice/PO
flows; cost centers; API hooks later.

Commercial & legal patterns (illustrative):\
• No subscription at launch; usage‑based RFP credits; potential volume
credits; co‑marketing exchanges.

Enablement & co‑marketing (how we launch together):\
• Brand onboarding: brief templates; case study gallery; team training;
dedicated AM for \>\$10k/mo spend.

Top risks & mitigations:\
• Outsized support needs; discount pressure; scope creep; favoritism
perceptions.

Operational playbooks (summary):\
• Pilot with clear SLAs; report deck; mutually agreed KPIs; exit ramp if
not a fit.

Owners & RACI:\
• Brand Partnerships lead, Growth, Support/AM, Legal.

KPIs & leading indicators:\
• RFP volume; response quality/time; conversion rate; repeat spend;
CSAT; NPS.

Acceptance criteria (ready / successful when):\
✓ 3--5 anchor brands per city; RFP pipeline healthy; conversion ≥
targets; co‑marketing content live.

Timeline & checkpoints:\
• Begin in Beta with 2--3 brands; expand post‑GA; formalize AM tiering
later.

Scenario Playbook --- Brand requests \'pay‑to‑win\':\
Trigger: Asks for undisclosed ranking priority\
Response: Decline; explain fairness policy; offer Featured slots with
labels and caps; educate on filters and RFPs.\
Legal/Comms: Written policy and one‑pager; internal alignment.\
Roll‑back/Forward: N/A\
Owner: Brand lead \| Telemetry: brand_satisfaction, provider_feedback \|
Evidence: Email threads; policy docs

Implementation Notes:\
• Partner Governance: Maintain a single source of truth for partner
status (prospect, NDA, pilot, GA), contacts, contracts, scopes, and
SLAs. Tag all features behind partner flags and city gates to avoid
blast‑radius mistakes. • Privacy & Data: Apply least‑data

§5 dashboards (e.g., ACH share by vendor, IDV completion rate by
provider, studio attach from verified partners). • Contracts: Avoid
exclusivity unless compensated; require termination rights, data
return/delete clauses, and uptime credits for SLA misses. • City
Sequencing: Some partners launch in founding cities only; we gate by
city to manage operational readiness. • Accessibility & Inclusion:
Ensure partner widgets meet WCAG 2.1 AA; provide text alternatives and
keyboard navigation.\
• Ethics & Brand Safety: Decline partners whose practices conflict with
user safety or our policy posture; include an ethics review in intake.

Partnerships Disclaimer: This is an internal planning document for
partner strategy and ecosystem development. It does not create
commitments. All integrations ship behind flags, follow privacy
policies, and require vendor due diligence, DPAs, SLAs, and legal
review. Commercial terms are illustrative until negotiated.

Context & Alignment: US‑only marketplace at launch; subscription‑free;
monetization via take‑rate and capped, eligibility‑gated usage‑based
promotions. Public content is artistic‑only with Safe‑Mode on for
guests. Deliverables flow via external links (Drive/Dropbox) with
immutable manifests; escrow releases on acceptance. Instant Book is
gated by ID verification; background checks are opt‑in (Trusted Pro).
Rollouts are city‑gated behind feature flags; Admin Console enforces
least‑privilege, JIT elevation, two‑person approvals, immutable audits,
and kill‑switches.

Goals:\
• Power verified social metrics, engagement filters, and growth trends
with official connections and compliant scopes.\
• Phase integration by feasibility and partner access, keeping link‑only
options where APIs are closed.

Target partner segments:\
• Instagram/Meta for verified metrics; YouTube/Google; TikTok; X
(Twitter); LinkedIn (Pages or partner access).\
• Third‑party analytics providers with compliant aggregation; link‑only
for others.

Mutual value proposition:\
• Buyers get confidence in reach/engagement; providers differentiate
with verified chips.\
• Platform gains unique discovery features and reasons to connect
accounts (stickiness).

Selection criteria & due diligence:\
• API scope minimalism; rate limits; clear policy; compliance with
platform terms; branding rules.\
• Ability to refresh nightly + manual refresh; fair use and quotas;
stability history.

Integration scopes & surfaces (what we build):\
• OAuth connects; fetch followers, ER, avg views; show verified chips;
trend sparklines.\
• Advanced metrics (phase 2) for connected accounts only; public
discovery within policy bounds.

Commercial & legal patterns (illustrative):\
• Typically no direct fees; rate‑limit & review constraints; potential
partner programs; compliance costs internal.

Enablement & co‑marketing (how we launch together):\
• Clear \'why connect\' copy; low‑friction OAuth; privacy info;
disconnect/self‑report options; verified‑only search toggle.

Top risks & mitigations:\
• API access changes; policy violations; misinterpretation of metrics;
rate‑limit induced outages.

Operational playbooks (summary):\
• Graceful degradation to self‑reported with \'unverified\' label; cache
and backoff; communicate transparently.

Owners & RACI:\
• Search/Data PMs; Legal; Security; Marketing for co‑marketing
approvals.

KPIs & leading indicators:\
• Connect rates; query usage for social filters; bookings uplift;
refresh success; support tickets on metrics.

Acceptance criteria (ready / successful when):\
✓ Verified chips working; nightly refresh within quotas; help content
clear; no policy violations.

Timeline & checkpoints:\
• Day‑1 IG/YT/TT/X; Phase‑2 LinkedIn if partner access; continuous
compliance reviews.

Scenario Playbook --- API quota exhaustion:\
Trigger: Refresh jobs fail due to rate limits\
Response: Backoff; prioritize top accounts; expose manual refresh
limits; show stale data banner.\
Legal/Comms: Help‑center notice; in‑product tooltip.\
Roll‑back/Forward: Re‑enable normal cadence after quota reset.\
Owner: Data/Search \| Telemetry: refresh_success, quota_usage \|
Evidence: Job logs; API responses

Creator Clubs)

§13.6 --- Education & Community Partners (Universities, Trade Schools,
Creator Clubs)

Partnerships Disclaimer: This is an internal planning document for
partner strategy and ecosystem development. It does not create
commitments. All integrations ship behind flags, follow privacy
policies, and require vendor due diligence, DPAs, SLAs, and legal
review. Commercial terms are illustrative until negotiated.

Context & Alignment: US‑only marketplace at launch; subscription‑free;
monetization via take‑rate and capped, eligibility‑gated usage‑based
promotions. Public content is artistic‑only with Safe‑Mode on for
guests. Deliverables flow via external links (Drive/Dropbox) with
immutable manifests; escrow releases on acceptance. Instant Book is
gated by ID verification; background checks are opt‑in (Trusted Pro).
Rollouts are city‑gated behind feature flags; Admin Console enforces
least‑privilege, JIT elevation, two‑person approvals, immutable audits,
and kill‑switches.

Goals:\
• Seed supply and cultivate best practices via education channels that
replenish the marketplace.\
• Offer safety training, portfolio reviews, and city meetups that build
trust and loyalty.

Target partner segments:\
• University photo/video programs; community colleges; trade schools;
creator clubs; camera stores; meetup groups.

Mutual value proposition:\
• Students and emerging creators get paid experience and safety
scaffolds; schools get career outcomes.\
• We gain verified, trained supply and grassroots co‑marketing.

Selection criteria & due diligence:\
• Program legitimacy; faculty champions; safety posture; willingness to
co‑host trainings and meetups.

Integration scopes & surfaces (what we build):\
• Campus workshops: Safe‑Mode, deliverables manifest, contracts,
reputation; co‑hosted creator days in partner studios.\
• Referral codes; verified badges for program participants (non‑monetary
recognition).

Commercial & legal patterns (illustrative):\
• Non‑financial in most cases; mutual promotion; event co‑sponsorship;
limited grants for founding programs.

Enablement & co‑marketing (how we launch together):\
• Campus starter kit; deck and curriculum; checklist for faculty; event
playbook; creator ambassador program.

Top risks & mitigations:\
• Overhead vs. ROI; policy misunderstandings; reputational risk if
program faces controversy.

Operational playbooks (summary):\
• Pilot small; measure outcomes; keep content apolitical; focus on craft
and safety; pause if controversy arises.

Owners & RACI:\
• Community lead, City Ops, Trust, Marketing.

KPIs & leading indicators:\
• Signups and activation from partner programs; time‑to‑first booking;
retention; safety incident rates among cohorts.

Acceptance criteria (ready / successful when):\
✓ At least 2 partner programs per city; workshops delivered; measurable
activation and safety improvements.

Timeline & checkpoints:\
• Begin in Houston beta; expand to Dallas/Austin; annual refresh of
materials.

Scenario Playbook --- Low activation from partner school:\
Trigger: Few bookings post‑workshop\
Response: Follow‑up coaching; pairing with studios; featured carousel
for graduates; refine curriculum.\
Legal/Comms: Newsletter spotlight; mentor program invitations.\
Roll‑back/Forward: Scale back if outcomes remain weak.\
Owner: Community lead \| Telemetry: activation_rate,
time_to_first_booking \| Evidence: Attendance, portfolio quality reviews

§13.7 --- API & Integration Partners (Zapier, Slack, Drive/Dropbox,
Calendar, CRM)

Partnerships Disclaimer: This is an internal planning document for
partner strategy and ecosystem development. It does not create
commitments. All integrations ship behind flags, follow privacy
policies, and require vendor due diligence, DPAs, SLAs, and legal
review. Commercial terms are illustrative until negotiated.

Context & Alignment: US‑only marketplace at launch; subscription‑free;
monetization via take‑rate and capped, eligibility‑gated usage‑based
promotions. Public content is artistic‑only with Safe‑Mode on for
guests. Deliverables flow via external links (Drive/Dropbox) with
immutable manifests; escrow releases on acceptance. Instant Book is
gated by ID verification; background checks are opt‑in (Trusted Pro).
Rollouts are city‑gated behind feature flags; Admin Console enforces
least‑privilege, JIT elevation, two‑person approvals, immutable audits,
and kill‑switches.

Goals:\
• Let power users connect our marketplace to their workflows without
compromising safety or fairness.\
• Start with read‑oriented, narrow scopes; expand only after abuse and
privacy reviews.

Target partner segments:\
• Zapier/IFTTT; Slack/MS Teams; Google Drive/Dropbox;
Google/Apple/Outlook Calendar; Notion/Airtable; Mailchimp/HubSpot for
brands.

Mutual value proposition:\
• Automations reduce admin toil (e.g., copy bookings to calendar, notify
teams, archive deliverables manifests).\
• Brands integrate with their CRMs; providers streamline follow‑ups and
reviews.

Selection criteria & due diligence:\
• OAuth scopes; per‑event webhooks; rate limits; strong ecosystem docs;
permissioning and audit logs.

Integration scopes & surfaces (what we build):\
• Outbound webhooks for booking events; calendar sync; file manifest
export; Slack notifications; RFP broadcast hooks.\
• Inbound limited (e.g., RFP create from a brand system) with strict
validation and rate limits.

Commercial & legal patterns (illustrative):\
• Most APIs free to integrate; paid plans for high call volumes; partner
directories for co‑listing.

Enablement & co‑marketing (how we launch together):\
• Developer portal (later); sample zaps; Slack app with scoped
permissions; step‑by‑step guides; support forum.

Top risks & mitigations:\
• Abuse via automations (spam); privacy leaks via over‑broad scopes;
rate‑limit exhaustion; shadow workflows creating support burden.

Operational playbooks (summary):\
• Throttle; per‑user caps; approval for certain zaps; audit logs;
automated abuse detection; revoke tokens on violations.

Owners & RACI:\
• Platform PM/Eng, Security, Data, Support.

KPIs & leading indicators:\
• Integration adoption; errors; rate‑limit hits; support tickets;
bookings attributed to integrations.

Acceptance criteria (ready / successful when):\
✓ Zaps and Slack app pass security review; scopes minimal; abuse anomaly
rates low; docs published.

Timeline & checkpoints:\
• Post multi‑city GA; staged allowlists; developer portal beta later.

Scenario Playbook --- Slack app spam:\
Trigger: Automated DMs create spam complaints\
Response: Disable outbound DM event; require manual approval; limit to
channels; add rate caps.\
Legal/Comms: Changelog and help‑center updates; outreach to affected
users.\
Roll‑back/Forward: Re‑enable with stricter scopes after mitigation.\
Owner: Platform PM/Security \| Telemetry: spam_reports, rate_limit_hits
\| Evidence: Webhook logs; Slack audit logs

Sequencing: Some partners launch in founding cities only; we gate by
city to manage operational readiness. • Accessibility & Inclusion:
Ensure partner widgets meet WCAG 2.1 AA; provide text alternatives and
keyboard navigation.\
• Ethics & Brand Safety: Decline partners whose practices conflict with
user safety or our policy posture; include an ethics review in intake.

Implementation Notes:\
• Partner Governance: Maintain a single source of truth for partner
status (prospect, NDA, pilot, GA), contacts, contracts, scopes, and
SLAs. Tag all features behind partner flags and city gates to avoid
blast‑radius mistakes. • Privacy & Data: Apply least‑data
principles---only request scopes needed for the user value; rotate
tokens; revoke access on inactivity. • Security & Audits: Vendor
SOC/pentest reports stored with expiry reminders; incident bridges
pre‑arranged for Sev‑1/Sev‑0. • Co‑Marketing Discipline: Announce after
pilots prove value; enforce clear success metrics; align PR/brand tone
with our artistic‑only policy. • Support & Playbooks: Create
partner‑specific macros; train Support/Trust on integration quirks; log
incidents with partner tags. • Measurement: Attribute partner impact in
§5 dashboards (e.g., ACH share by vendor, IDV completion rate by
provider, studio attach from verified partners). • Contracts: Avoid
exclusivity unless compensated; require termination rights, data
return/delete clauses, and uptime credits for SLA misses. • City
Sequencing: Some partners launch in founding cities only; we gate by

Appendix A --- Glossary & Role Map

Generated on 2025-11-04 23:53:44 UTC

Purpose\
This appendix standardizes the language and responsibilities used across
the plan. It prevents ambiguity across product, engineering, trust &
safety, support, finance, legal, data, and city ops. It aligns directly
with Sections 1 (UX), 3 (Monetization), 4 (Architecture), 5 (Data), 8
(Policies), 10 (Launch), 11 (Risk), and 12 (Roadmap).

A1. Core Marketplace Terms (Plain‑English)

• \*\*Buyer\*\* --- The party paying for a service (e.g., photographer
hiring a model, brand hiring a creator, or buyer booking a studio in
later phases). May be an individual or a business/brand account.

• \*\*Provider / Seller / Talent\*\* --- A user offering services
(model, photographer, videographer, content creator). A single person
can hold multiple roles.

• \*\*Studio Host\*\* --- A business or individual offering a physical
studio/location for shoots (phase‑gated).

• \*\*Service Profile\*\* --- A role‑specific profile (e.g., \'Model\',
\'Photographer\') under one account, each with its own packages,
availability, reviews, and pricing.

• \*\*Package\*\* --- A priced bundle (time, scope, deliverables) a
provider offers. Buyers can add extras and licensing.

• \*\*Instant Book\*\* --- Booking flow that does not require explicit
provider approval. Requires ID Verification; can be toggled by the
provider.

• \*\*Escrow\*\* --- Funds held by the platform until
completion/acceptance; reduces fraud and enables dispute resolution.

• \*\*Change Order\*\* --- A post‑acceptance modification to
date/time/scope/price, proposed by either party and accepted by the
other.

• \*\*Deliverables Manifest\*\* --- A structured list of items the
provider commits to deliver (files, counts, formats). We store an
immutable external‑link manifest for evidence.

• \*\*Acceptance Window\*\* --- Time after deliverables are posted for
the buyer to accept or raise issues before escrow releases
automatically.

• \*\*LBG (Linked Booking Group)\*\* --- A multi‑leg booking (e.g.,
talent + studio) paid as one transaction with separate receipts.
Phase‑gated.

• \*\*Reputation Score\*\* --- A 0--100 score derived from reviews,
reliability, responsiveness, verifications, and recent performance
(role‑aware, time‑weighted).

• \*\*Verified/Trusted Pro\*\* --- Badges for ID‑verified users and
background‑checked users, respectively.

• \*\*Promoted / Boosted\*\* --- Paid visibility units (capped, labeled,
eligibility‑gated). Never override relevance.

• \*\*Safe‑Mode\*\* --- Default public content filter for guests. Public
surfaces allow only artistic‑grade content; explicit sexual content is
disallowed.

• \*\*Boards\*\* --- Buyer's saved shortlists of providers for a
project. Board sponsor (later) is a paid placement product.

• \*\*RFP\*\* --- Request For Proposal---buyer broadcasts a brief to
vetted providers meeting filters.

• \*\*Dispute\*\* --- Formal resolution process when either party
contests delivery, timeliness, or policy violations.

• \*\*Support Case\*\* --- Ticket in the admin console tying user
reports, refunds, and moderation actions to a single timeline.

• \*\*City Gate / Allowlist\*\* --- Feature flag and supply gating per
city to ensure measured rollouts and reversible changes.

A2. Role Map (RACI)

Roles: Buyer/Brand; Provider (Model/Photographer/Videographer/Creator);
Studio Host; Support; Trust & Safety; Finance; Tax; Payments; City GM;
Growth/Promotions; Product; SRE/Security; Legal; Data.\
For each core workflow (search, booking, change order, deliverables,
acceptance, dispute, payout, promotions, verification), this map
clarifies who is Responsible (doing), Accountable (owning outcome),
Consulted (providing input), and Informed (kept aware).

• \*\*Search & Discovery\*\* --- Responsible: Product/Search;
Accountable: Product; Consulted: Data, Trust; Informed: Support, City
Ops

• \*\*Booking & Escrow\*\* --- Responsible: Product/Payments;
Accountable: Product; Consulted: Finance, Tax, Trust; Informed: Support,
City Ops

• \*\*Change Order & Reschedule\*\* --- Responsible: Product;
Accountable: Product; Consulted: Support; Informed: Finance

• \*\*Deliverables & Acceptance\*\* --- Responsible: Product;
Accountable: Product; Consulted: Trust/Support; Informed: Finance

• \*\*Disputes\*\* --- Responsible: Support; Accountable: Trust;
Consulted: Legal/Product; Informed: Finance

• \*\*Payouts & Reserves\*\* --- Responsible: Payments/Finance;
Accountable: Finance; Consulted: Support; Informed: Trust

• \*\*Promotions (Boost/Featured)\*\* --- Responsible: Growth;
Accountable: Growth; Consulted: Product/Data/Trust; Informed: Support

• \*\*Verification (IDV/BG)\*\* --- Responsible: Trust; Accountable:

Product; Consulted: Trust/Legal; Informed: Support/City Ops

A3. Acronyms & Short Codes

S→I (Search→Inquiry) \| I→B (Inquiry→Booking) \| IDV (Identity
Verification) \| BG (Background Check) \| ER (Engagement Rate) \| ACH
(Automated Clearing House) \| KYC/KYB \| PCI \| WCAG \| RFP \| LBG \|
SOW \| PO

A4. Term/Label Canon (UI vs Data vs Legal)

We maintain a canonical mapping of UI labels, data field names, and
legal language to avoid drift. Example:\
UI: \'Change Order\' → Data: change_order_event → Legal: \'amendment\'.
UI: \'Buyer fee\' → Data: buyer_fee_amt → Legal: \'Service fee\'.

A5. Acceptance & Ownership

Owner: Product Ops. Review cadence: quarterly. Change control: PRD +
Slack #product‑ops; update Help Center and Admin copy on change.

Implementation Notes:\
• Keep this appendix version‑controlled; link to the controlling owner
and next review date.\
• Align terminology with Section 1 UI labels and Section 5 metrics
catalog; avoid synonyms that confuse staff.\
• When examples include numbers, ensure they reconcile to Section 3.1
fee math and Section 4.12 receipts.\
• Accessibility: all templates should be usable with keyboard‑only
navigation and screen readers.\
• Privacy: avoid embedding real PII in examples; use placeholders
consistently.\
• City‑gates: where content varies by city, call out the delta
explicitly and tie to the corresponding feature flag.\
• Training: every appendix should have a 1‑page executive summary and a
\'how to use this\' section for Support/Trust.\
• Change control: every material change requires an entry in the
changelog, owner sign‑off, and a Slack announcement to the relevant
channel.

Appendix B --- Data Dictionary (Quick Reference to §5.5)

Generated on 2025-11-04 23:53:44 UTC

Purpose\
This appendix is a field‑level quick reference for analysts and
engineers. The authoritative schema lives in the warehouse (Section 5).
This guide summarizes Fact and Dimension tables, keys, privacy tags,
freshness, and common joins, so product and support can communicate
unambiguously.

B1. Naming, Keys & Privacy

Naming: snake_case for tables/columns. Facts store events/transactions;
Dimensions store entities/attributes.\
Keys: surrogate keys with id prefixes (user_id, booking_id). Foreign
keys explicit. Composite keys where necessary.\
Privacy tags: P0 (PII‑sensitive like TIN), P1 (contact), P2
(behavioral), P3 (public). Access controlled per §4.14.1.

B2. Core Dimensions

• \*\*user_dim\*\* --- User account and global settings.\
Fields: user_id (PK), created_at_ts, email_hash (P1), phone_hash (P1),
country_code, state_code, city, role_flags, idv_status,
trusted_pro_status, rep_overall_score, deletion_status

• \*\*service_profile_dim\*\* --- Role‑specific offerings.\
Fields: service_profile_id (PK), user_id (FK), role_type
(\'model\'\|\'photographer\'\|\'videographer\'\|\'creator\'), headline,
rate_min, rate_max, instant_book_enabled, nsfw_opt_in,
studio_verified_flag, rep_role_score

• \*\*location_dim\*\* --- Geo lookup.\
Fields: location_id (PK), city, state_code, lat, lng, metro_area,
timezone

• \*\*time_dim\*\* --- Calendar/time grain.\
Fields: time_id (PK), date, week, month, quarter, year, dow, hour

• \*\*studio_dim (beta)\*\* --- Studios/hosts.\
Fields: studio_id (PK), owner_user_id (FK), name, address_hash (P1),
verified_flag, deposit_default_amt, house_rules_version

B3. Core Facts (Events/Transactions)

• \*\*booking_fact\*\* --- One row per booking
request/acceptance/completion.\
Fields: booking_id (PK), buyer_user_id, provider_user_id,
service_profile_id, role_type, location_id, created_time_id, state
(\'requested\'\|\'accepted\'\|\'completed\'\|\'disputed\'\|\'canceled\'),
subtotal_amt, travel_fee_amt, buyer_fee_amt, provider_fee_amt, tax_amt,
payment_method (\'card\'\|\'ach\')

• \*\*booking_leg_fact (LBG)\*\* --- One row per leg (talent/studio) in
group bookings.\
Fields: leg_id (PK), booking_id (FK), leg_type (\'talent\'\|\'studio\'),
leg_subtotal_amt, leg_tax_amt, deposit_auth_amt, accept_time_id,
complete_time_id

• \*\*payment_fact\*\* --- Charges/refunds.\
Fields: payment_id (PK), booking_id, charge_amt, refund_amt, processor,
3ds_flag, ach_flag, status

• \*\*payout_fact\*\* --- Provider/host payouts.\
Fields: payout_id (PK), user_id, amount, reserve_withheld_amt,
reserve_released_amt, early_payout_fee_amt, status

• \*\*tax_quote_fact\*\* --- Tax engine responses.\
Fields: tax_quote_id (PK), booking_id, state_code, jurisdiction_code,
quote_amt, latency_ms, success_flag

• \*\*promotion_impression_fact\*\* --- Paid card impressions.\
Fields: impression_id (PK), service_profile_id, placement, qs_score,
bid_cpc, city, timestamp, buyer_session_id

• \*\*promotion_click_fact\*\* --- Clicks on promoted cards.\
Fields: click_id (PK), impression_id (FK), ctr_position,
valid_click_flag, cpc_charged_amt

• \*\*conversion_fact\*\* --- Inquiry/booking conversions attributed to
impressions.\

appeal_flag, final_decision

B4. Joins & Common Queries

Examples: profile discovery funnel; promotions ROAS; dispute loss rate;
payout latency by role. Include sample SQL patterns and caution about
double counting.

B5. Freshness & Quality SLOs

Gold tables freshness ≤ 15 min for events, ≤ 24h for aggregates. Data
quality gates: completeness, uniqueness, referential integrity.

B6. Ownership & Change Control

Owners: Data team. Schema changes require RFC; version notes; downstream
impact analysis.

Appendix C --- Policy Templates (SOW, Releases, House Rules, Adverse
Action)

Generated on 2025-11-04 23:53:44 UTC

Purpose\
Provide neutral, plain‑English templates that users and staff can adopt.
These are not legal advice. They must be reviewed by counsel before
publication. Where FCRA applies (background checks), we include
pre‑adverse/adverse action letter templates and timing notes.

C1. SOW (Statement of Work) --- Template

Sections: Parties; Date/Location; Scope; Deliverables (manifest);
Usage/License; Fees/Deposits; Changes/Overtime; Travel; Cancellations;
Safety & Conduct; Confidentiality; Dispute Resolution; Signatures.\
Notes: Keep role‑agnostic; insert exhibit for role specifics (e.g.,
photo retouch counts, video cuts).

C2. Model Release --- Template

Plain‑English clauses: Consent; Scope of Use; Duration; Territory;
Compensation; Credit; Revocation limits; No moral rights; Safety; Age of
Majority declaration; Witness line. Includes fields to attach IDV
reference ID (not storing the ID itself in the document).

C3. Property/Studio Release --- Template

Clauses: Permission to use premises; Areas allowed; Time windows;
Restrictions (nudity policy compliance); Insurance; Indemnity; Damages;
Deposit rules; House rules; Signatures.

C4. House Rules (Studio) --- Template

Structure: Safety; Fire exits; No smoking/vaping; Sound limits; Maximum
occupancy; Cleanliness; Allowed props; Pet policy; Nudity policy;
Neighbor respect; Overtime fees; Deposit conditions; Contacts for
emergencies.

C5. FCRA Letters (Background Checks) --- Templates

Pre‑Adverse Action: Notice, copy of report, summary of rights, time to
respond (e.g., 5 business days).\
Adverse Action: Final decision, reasons, reporting agency contact,
rights to dispute, no decision by agency disclaimer.\
Timing notes: Timer starts when user receives the notice; admin console
tracks deadlines (see §4.14.3).

C6. Publishing & Versioning

Owner: Legal/Trust. Version control: numbered exhibits. City deltas:
callouts. Accessibility and plain‑language review required.

Appendix D --- City Scoring Model (Expansion Readiness)

Generated on 2025-11-04 23:53:44 UTC

Purpose\
Provide an objective method to evaluate new cities for expansion,
avoiding hype‑driven decisions. The model aligns with Section 2 GTM and
Section 12 roadmap gates. It produces a composite score with go/no‑go
recommendations, data sources, and staffing implications.

D1. Scoring Axes & Weights (Example)

• \*\*Supply Depth (30%)\*\* --- Active creators/providers per 10k
population; studio partners; education partners; social presence.

• \*\*Demand Potential (25%)\*\* --- Local ad spend proxies; SMB
density; DTC presence; content‑hungry verticals.

• \*\*Unit Economics (20%)\*\* --- CPC expectations; estimated take‑rate
GMV; tax complexity; payment costs.

• \*\*Operational Readiness (15%)\*\* --- Moderator/Support
availability; local studio partners; legal comfort.

• \*\*Competitive/PR (10%)\*\* --- Competitor presence; partnership
opportunities; press friendliness.

D2. Data Sources & Collection

Internal: waitlists, signups, search traffic, conversion in adjacent
cities. External: census data, business registries, ad spend proxies,
social trend indices.

D3. Score Calculation & Thresholds

Normalize each axis to 0--100; apply weights; composite score ≥ 70 →
consider Beta; 60--69 → nurture; \< 60 → defer. Add qualitative notes.

D4. Decision Packet Template

One‑pager with score, map, supply heatmap, top partners, risks,
staffing, budget, PR plan, and a proposed launch window.

D5. Governance & Review

Quarterly review; Section 11 risk sanity check; Section 9 budget
alignment; Section 10 playbook readiness.

Appendix E --- Revenue Recognition Notes & Fee Math Examples (ties to
§3.1)

Generated on 2025-11-04 23:53:44 UTC

Purpose\
Document how platform fees are recognized under a marketplace model, how
refunds and adjustments are treated, and provide clear numerical
examples that match receipts (§4.12) and fee engine rules (§3.1).
Coordinate with accounting counsel for GAAP compliance. This is not
accounting advice.

E1. Revenue Streams & When Recognized

Provider fee (commission) --- recognized at the point the service is
delivered and accepted (or auto‑accepted). Buyer service fee ---
recognized at transaction processing; refunded on provider‑fault
cancellations per policy. Promotions revenue --- recognized on delivery
of impressions/clicks or over the weekly term for Featured.

E2. Escrow, Refunds, Adjustments

Escrow liability sits until acceptance; change orders adjust the
contract value; refunds reduce recognized revenue if already recognized;
otherwise release liability.

E3. Worked Examples (Step‑by‑Step)

• \*\*Example A\*\* --- Talent booking \$600; buyer fee 5%; provider fee
12% minus Instant Book 1% and Trusted Pro 0.5%; ACH used; show journal
entries for charge, escrow, acceptance, payout, fees.

• \*\*Example B\*\* --- Change order +\$100; acceptance delayed; buyer
cancels under rules; compute partial refund and fee impact.

• \*\*Example C\*\* --- Dispute resulting in 30% refund post‑acceptance;
show revenue adjustment and payout clawback if applicable.

E4. Journal Entry Patterns (Illustrative)

Include debits/credits for cash, escrow liability, revenue (provider
fee, buyer fee), processor fees, promotions, refunds/chargebacks,
reserves, early payout fees.

E5. Reconciliation & Controls

Daily close checklist; settlement variances; dispute fees; promotions
credits; tax memos.

E6. Acceptance & Ownership

Owner: Finance. Review cadence: monthly with Section 9; sync with §4.12
ledger outputs and exports.

Appendix F --- Tax Nexus Matrix Snapshot (ties to §4.12/§5.10)

Generated on 2025-11-04 23:53:44 UTC

Purpose\
Provide the structure of our tax nexus and taxability matrix without
hard‑coding rates or legal conclusions. This appendix explains how the
matrix is maintained, how the tax engine allowlist works, and how
Support communicates tax outcomes. It is a guide, not legal advice.

F1. Matrix Structure (Template)

Columns: State; City/County; Taxability of services (talent, studio,
digital deliverables); Marketplace facilitator obligations; Sourcing
rule (origin/destination); Registration status; Effective date;
Notes/links. Values are maintained in Admin by Tax role and published to
the tax engine allowlist.

F2. Change Control & Reviews

Quarterly review with counsel; engine sync logs; reconciliation
variances trigger investigation; audit trail stored in Admin (§4.14.7).

F3. Support Macros & Receipts Language

Plain‑English explainer for buyers: when and why taxes appear; ACH
discount messaging; amended receipt process for state‑level changes.

F4. Acceptance & Ownership

Owner: Tax & Compliance. Acceptance: zero reconciliation variances
beyond tolerance; clear help‑center entries; training complete.

Appendix G --- Experiment Pre‑Registration Template (ties to §5.13)

Generated on 2025-11-04 23:53:44 UTC

Purpose\
Create a repeatable, auditable template for experiments that affect
discovery, pricing, messaging limits, or safety thresholds.
Pre‑registration reduces bias (\'p‑hacking\') and aligns teams on
guardrails and success criteria before launch.

G1. Template Fields

• \*\*Title & ID\*\* --- Experiment name and tracking ID.

• \*\*Owner & Reviewers\*\* --- Product, Data, Trust, Finance sign‑offs.

• \*\*Hypothesis\*\* --- Falsifiable statement including target segment
and expected direction of effect.

• \*\*Primary Metrics\*\* --- Exactly one or two (e.g., S→I, I→B,
dispute loss rate). Defined in §5 catalog.

• \*\*Guardrail Metrics\*\* --- Must not degrade (e.g., organic S→I,
buyer hide rate, safety reports, payout latency).

• \*\*Population & Randomization\*\* --- Eligibility, stratification
(city/role), unit of assignment, holdout size.

• \*\*Sample Size & Power\*\* --- Pre‑computed; expected duration with
traffic estimates.

• \*\*Treatments\*\* --- What changes and what remains constant;
screenshots/copy.

• \*\*Instrumentation\*\* --- Events, experiment bucketing, attribution
windows.

• \*\*Analysis Plan\*\* --- Statistical tests, treatment of outliers,
sequential monitoring rules.

• \*\*Stop/Extend/End Criteria\*\* --- Numerical thresholds; min
runtime; quality checks.

• \*\*Rollout Plan\*\* --- Flags, cities, staged ramp, rollback recipe.

• \*\*Comms Plan\*\* --- Internal release notes; help‑center changes;
external messaging if any.

• \*\*Risks & Ethics\*\* --- Identify bias risks, fairness, and user
harm; mitigation.

• \*\*Post‑Mortem Checklist\*\* --- What worked, what didn't, what to
productize.

G2. Example (Promotions Density Cap A/B)

Outline a worked example with metrics (ROAS ≥ 2.5×) and guardrails
(organic S→I no worse than −3%). Include holdout cell and city gating.

G3. Storage & Discoverability

All pre‑regs stored in the warehouse (Gold) and mirrored in the Admin
experiments registry; searchable by owner, city, and metric.

G4. Acceptance & Ownership

Owner: Data Science. Acceptance: no experiment ships without a pre‑reg;
post‑mortems added within 7 days of completion.
