Summary:
No work was completed in this run; all planned tasks remain pending. The initial Smart Docs data model migration, backend service scaffolding, API/schema extensions, and hashing/S3 abstractions were planned but not started. Downstream UI, PDF rendering, e-sign provider integration, checkout enforcement, and telemetry are also pending.

Assessment:
Since no development or testing has been done, there is no quality evidence or automation/tests to evaluate. The risk remains high due to zero progress on foundational components. Missing automation includes unit tests for the data model, backend services, API schema, and evidence abstractions.

Conclusion:
The WBS-007 work is not yet started and cannot be considered complete for this phase.

Do NOT mark WBS-007 as complete.
