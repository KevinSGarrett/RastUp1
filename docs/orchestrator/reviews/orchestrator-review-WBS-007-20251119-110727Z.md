Summary:
No work was completed in this run. The entire scope remains pending, including the initial Smart Docs data model migration, backend service scaffolding, API/schema extensions with tests, and hashing/S3 abstractions. Downstream UI, PDF rendering, e-sign integration, checkout enforcement, and telemetry are also untouched.

Quality, Risks, and Missing Automation:
Since no implementation was done, there is no quality or testing to assess. The planned unit and schema validation tests are still missing. The lack of progress poses a risk to schedule and downstream dependencies.

Conclusion:
The WBS-007 work is not complete for this phase and requires active development to meet its objectives.

Do NOT mark WBS-007 as complete.
