Summary:
No work was completed in this run; all planned tasks remain pending. The initial Smart Docs data model migration, backend service scaffolding, API/schema extensions, and hashing/S3 abstractions were planned but not started. Downstream UI/admin integration, PDF rendering, e-sign provider wiring, checkout enforcement, and telemetry are also pending.

Quality, Risks, and Missing Automation:
Since no implementation occurred, there is no quality assessment or test coverage to evaluate. The absence of any unit or integration tests or automation is a significant risk for progressing without validation. The lack of progress also delays dependent components and increases schedule risk.

Conclusion:
Given that no planned work was accomplished and all tasks remain pending, it is not reasonable to mark WBS-007 as complete for this phase.

Do NOT mark WBS-007 as complete.
