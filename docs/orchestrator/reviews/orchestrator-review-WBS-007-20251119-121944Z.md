Summary:
- No planned tasks for WBS-007 Part 1 were completed; this run marks the kickoff with zero progress.
- All core development tasks remain pending, including data model migration, backend scaffolding, API/schema extensions, and hashing/S3 abstractions.
- Additional downstream integrations and telemetry are also outstanding.

Assessment:
- No quality artifacts or tests were produced yet.
- No automation or test coverage exists at this stage.
- Risks include delayed downstream integration and lack of foundational backend components.
- The run is effectively a baseline start with no deliverables achieved.

Conclusion:
Do NOT mark WBS-007 as complete.
