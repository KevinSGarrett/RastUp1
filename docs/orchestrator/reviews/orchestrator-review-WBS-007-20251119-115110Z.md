Summary:
No work was completed in this run; all planned tasks remain pending. The initial Smart Docs data model migration, backend service scaffolding, API/schema extensions, and hashing/S3 abstractions were planned but not started. Downstream UI, PDF rendering, e-sign integration, checkout enforcement, and telemetry are also pending.

Assessment:
Since no development or testing has been done, there is no quality or risk data to assess. No automation or tests have been implemented yet. The WBS is at the very start of execution.

Conclusion:
Do NOT mark WBS-007 as complete.
