Summary:
No work was completed in this run; all planned tasks remain pending. The initial Smart Docs data model migration, backend service scaffolding, API/schema extensions, and hashing/S3 abstractions were planned but not started. Downstream UI, PDF rendering, e-sign provider integration, checkout enforcement, and telemetry are also pending.

Assessment:
Since no development or testing has been done, there is no quality evidence or risk mitigation in place. No automation or tests have been implemented yet, increasing risk for delays and integration issues.

Conclusion:
Do NOT mark WBS-007 as complete.
