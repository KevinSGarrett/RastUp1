Summary:
No work was completed in this run; all planned tasks remain pending. The initial Smart Docs data model migration, backend service scaffolding, API/schema extensions, and hashing/S3 abstractions were planned but not started. Downstream UI, PDF rendering, e-sign integration, checkout enforcement, and telemetry are also pending.

Quality, Risks, and Missing Automation:
Since no implementation occurred, there is no quality assessment possible. Critical automation such as unit tests and schema validation remain unstarted. The absence of any progress poses a risk to schedule and integration dependencies.

Conclusion:
The WBS-007 work is not complete for this phase and requires active development to meet its objectives.

Do NOT mark WBS-007 as complete.
