Summary:
No work was completed in this run; all planned tasks remain pending. The initial Smart Docs data model migration, backend service scaffolding, API/schema extensions, and hashing/S3 abstractions were planned but not started. Downstream UI, PDF rendering, e-sign provider integration, checkout enforcement, and telemetry are also pending.

Assessment:
Since no development or testing has been done, there is no quality evidence or risk mitigation in place. No automation or tests have been implemented yet. The run represents a kickoff with zero progress.

Conclusion:
Do NOT mark WBS-007 as complete.
