Summary:
No work was completed in this run; all planned tasks remain pending. The initial Smart Docs data model migration, backend service scaffolding, API/schema extensions, and hashing/S3 abstractions have not yet been started. Downstream UI, PDF rendering, e-sign integration, checkout enforcement, and telemetry are also pending.

Assessment:
Since no development or testing has been done, there is no quality evidence or automation/tests to assess. The risk remains high due to zero progress and many critical components still unaddressed.

Conclusion:
Do NOT mark WBS-007 as complete.
