Performance & Security Status:
- Performance tests: Not run (frontend UI not yet scaffolded; pending WBS-019/WBS-022 deliverables).
- Security scans: Not run (no CI tooling / make target available); policy modules implemented but integration tests pending.
- Recommended follow-up: bootstrap `make ci` pipeline with linting, Lighthouse CI, and security checks once tooling exists.
